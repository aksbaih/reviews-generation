5424,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ardmore) 14 year old 2000 Cask #233, 54.3%<review>If you needed proof that Scotch whiskies don’t fit neatly into established categories, look no further than this marine style, peated Highland malt. Sea salt, oyster shells, and light smoke lead the nose, with hay and apricot underneath. In the entry, the flavors burst on the palate with sea salt, honey, malt, oak, and smoke. Peat smoke really builds in the mid-palate but manages not to lose the supporting flavors, although it becomes the real star of a long finish. (U.S. only)"
5425,"<price>36<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker A Song of Fire, 40.8%<review>Named for House Targaryen from Game of Thrones. Aromas of malt, peppercorn, dry chile flakes, spicy nachos, sliced red apples, roasted whole spices, and soft smoke from snuffed candles. On the palate, this has a light, floaty texture with flavors of red apple at its core, followed by a roar of spice, citrus peel, lemon, sharp fruity acidity, vanilla pod, and a touch of walnut. The finish is lengthy and spicy."
5426,"<price>23<rating>86<whiskey>Niagara Falls Rye, 40%<review>A straightforward 4 year old Canadian blend, great for mixing, but good for sipping too. It presents flavors of toffee, brisk spices, kiwi fruit, charred wood, and sweet barley sugars. A creamy body with pleasingly penetrating pepper that feels minty-warm, like menthol. Not overly complex, but getting there. More pepper and a refreshing, slightly bitter pithiness on a medium finish. A creamy palate soothes the energetic attack of the spices."
5427,"<price>59<rating>86<whiskey>Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Fettercairn), 46%<review>Earthy on the early nose, with a brief whiff of boiled cabbage and contrasting hints of violet. Ripe apples and pears on the relatively full palate, with toffee, honey, and a background earthiness. The finish is medium in length, herbal, with ginger and bog oak. (308 bottles)"
5428,"<price>229<rating>90<whiskey>Ballantine’s Limited, 43%<review>If Willy Wonka was ever inclined to condense a knickerbocker glory into a dram, it would nose and taste like this: caramel toffee, hints of cocoa, peeled banana, chewy marshmallows, cream, and gooey fudge sauce. The palate has banana, slightly burnt caramel, poached pear, and Banoffee pie layered over mixed peel flavors, adding to its delicious appeal. It’s sweet, dry, smooth, and comforting, like that final satisfying mouthful drained from a mug of hot chocolate. Comfort food for thirsty people."
5429,"<price>79<rating>93<whiskey>Wiser’s Red Letter 2014 Release Virgin Oak Finish, 45%<review>Pencil shavings, then vanilla, caramel, barley sugar, and bitter candied orange peel. Mild white pepper persists in a spicy fusion, from which a subtle but energizing pithiness teases out delicate smatterings of cloves, ginger, and allspice. The fruitiness of canned peaches, apricots, and sour green apples adds dimension and balance. Complex and so tightly integrated that rich as it is, individual flavors are little more than nuances. Finish is long and gingery with refreshing citrus pith. (Canada only) C$100"
5430,"<price>48<rating>76<whiskey>Knockando 12 year old, 43%<review>Since Diageo has included Knockando in its Special Release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling. This is Speyside in its maltiest guise. The nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal: Weetabix and bran flakes, with a whisper of vanilla. The palate is light and dusty, and you get the impression that the malt just wants to scuttle across the tongue and down the throat as quickly as possible. A shy wee mouse of a dram. £30"
5431,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Paul John Peated Select Cask, 55.5%<review>Earthy notes, with plain chocolate nibs, malt drinks, and a little leather. There’s a subtle smoky air; nothing too astringent or overpowering. It’s great to try if you’re new to peaty whiskies or were put off by a peat colossus from Islay. Fig, plums, and soft prunes, though it’s mouth-puckering neat, so cut it down. Then, the fruit rounds out beautifully, allowing some gentle spices to shine through with some coffee bean notes at the end. Terrific stuff. £68"
5432,"<price>3700<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park 1971 Vintage, 46.7%<review>One of two recent vintage releases, this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen Spanish oak casks, that yielded a total of 657 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with maple syrup, almonds, and sherry. Soft and insinuating. Becoming progressively smokier. Bold fruit and peat notes on the palate, plus oak, cloves, and dark chocolate notes. Peppery in the long finish, with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits."
5433,"<price>150<rating>84<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Tormore) 1988, 64.2%<review>There’s something rather round peg in a square hole about Tormore, that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest Speyside. The whisky, sadly, is often the same. Here, though, things look promising to start with: rice crackers, and a spicy, rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented, sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. The palate, for me, is still too rigid. For all its efforts to relax, this Tormore remains tense. £90"
5434,"<price>34<rating>85<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 1994 Vintage, 40%<review>The fifth vintage of Knappogue Castle and the second consecutive one comprised of whiskey from the Bushmills distillery. (The previous three were from the Cooley Distillery.) This one is very clean and quite soft on the palate, with a gentle sweetness throughout (fresh malt, vanilla, and honey). Floral and citrus notes offer a subtle pleasantness throughout. Soft, soothing creamy vanilla finish with hints of confectioners sugar and lightly toasted marshmallow. This is a pleasant, versatile Irish whiskey to have in your bar to serve neat, on the rocks, or in smart cocktails. 
"
5435,"<price>95<rating>83<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Tomatin) 10 year old 2004 (cask #2645), 57.4%<review>Matured solely in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a light, fruit-forward nose with nectarine, honey, malt, and a touch of spice. The entry is softer than you’d expect for the proof and it presents the fruit at the nose, along with salt and a dash of black pepper. The spice takes over in the mid-palate along with some heat, really throwing off the balance established in the entry. A light finish closes out a slightly disjointed taste experience. (U.S. only)"
5436,"<price>53<rating>85<whiskey>Clynelish 14 year old, 43%<review>Ahh, Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate whisky, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed."
5437,"<price>79<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Lord Elcho 15 year old, 40%<review>It's not often that the blended whisky section can be described as 'the group of death' but at most other times this whisky would shine. It's a very good whisky, rich in flavor and punching above its 40% ABV, mixing creamy vanilla, pureed peach and apricot, key lime pie, chocolate, and manuka honey to great effect. It's soft and rounded, with little obvious oak, and the finish is feather-light, with a slightly fruit sponge finale. £50"
5438,"<price>72<rating>87<whiskey> GlenDronach Cask Strength (batch 5), 55.3%<review>This batch of GlenDronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. Malt, honey, rose blossom, and chocolate-coated Turkish Delight, plus emerging vanilla on the nose. The palate is full and rounded, very sweet, with more milk chocolate and very gentle spice. The finish is lengthy, with milky coffee, sweet spices, and subtle oak."
5439,"<price>127<rating>90<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 22 year old, 51.5%<review>Immediate rancio notes, with some hazelnut and cheese rind. Added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into Brandy de Jerez territory. Sumptuous stuff, with Miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note, something which is enhanced with water. The tannins are light, allowing a silky feel to predominate, with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. Very good indeed. £81"
5440,"<price>59<rating>89<whiskey>Fettercairn 12 year old, 40%<review>Malt and mango on the nose, with just a hint of meatiness and earth. Pear and resin notes appear in time. Orchard fruits, vanilla, cloves, and cocoa powder on the palate. The sweet fruit notes are quite intense. Hazelnut and fudge in the medium-length finish. (£48)"
5441,"<price>99<rating>90<whiskey>Sazerac 18 year old Kentucky Straight Rye (2019 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 45%<review>A nose of orange peel, dusty spice, licorice, cherry, dark fruit, and cola leads to a palate that’s spiced and smooth, and offers notes of lemon, orange peel, and pepper. Water enhances the citrus notes, and also brings out bitter cherry, dried orange slices, leather, and cracked pepper. The finish has good length, with a fair amount of oak influence, orange marmalade, cigar ash, dark chocolate, and bitter herbs."
5442,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Cask 17 Rye, 46%<review>Rye grain, Bavarian sour rye bread, rich linseed oil, and vague hints of peppermint drift out of the bottle when you first pull the cork. The sweet, oily palate is alive with ginger and wasabi, accented by acetone, high fruity esters, and teasing hints of sweet flowers. Notes of plasticine and the earthiness of river plants add complexity. The whisky sizzles with pepper throughout, returning to sour rye as the finish fades ever so slowly."
5443,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon (2019 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 50.5%<review>Vanilla nougat, violet candies, maple syrup, blueberry jam, root beer, spiced peanuts, iced tea, and rich cooked fruit on the nose. Creamy and nutty on the palate, with milk chocolate, bitter orange, Coca-Cola, roasted pecans, blackberry jam, and lush, silky spice. The lengthy, full finish showcases a panoply of spice—none of it hot—along with cooked cherries, dark chocolate, and leathery oak. Excellent construction and balance of flavors; no water needed."
5444,"<price>400<rating>93<whiskey>The Balvenie 30 year old 1973 Vintage (Cask #9219)<review>The last Balvenie Vintage whisky I tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 Vintage. This new vintage has some big shoes (or should I say bottles?) to fill, so how does it stand up to the 1966 Vintage? This 1973 Vintage is equally as impressive. In contrast to the massive, evolving, sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below, this one shows more subtlety and finesse. It is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. A honeyed, malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange, lemon), complex spice (vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood), and subtle herbs. Very contemplative."
5445,"<price>113<rating>90<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s 23 year old Cask Strength Blended, 64.3%<review>This long-aged blend of all-rye and all-corn whiskies celebrates J.P. Wiser’s belief that great whisky can’t be rushed. A dry nose with rye spices and overripe pears is quite complex. The palate, sweet and somewhat drying, suddenly shows strong ripe cherry notes, then pipe tobacco, cigar box, lingering heat, medium weight, gorgeous woody notes, and strong peppery spices. Hints of rye spices punctuate a long, hot, and fruity finish. 150 CAD"
5446,"<price>139<rating>90<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2018), 57.8%<review>Lagavulin 12 year old is represented in Diageo’s annual Special Releases lineup for the fifteenth consecutive year. This was matured in refill American oak barrels. Earthy, peppery peat are present on the nose, along with hazelnuts, seaweed, and lemon juice. It offers citrus fruit, bonfire smoke, pepper, chili, and antiseptic on the palate. The medium-length finish features smoked chilies."
5447,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 8 year old (distilled at Pulteney), 40%<review>Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon & MacPhail, this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon & MacPhail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky."
5448,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 1992 Vintage, 43%<review>Straw color. In both aroma and flavor, the whiskey is clean and delicate, with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, and subtle fruit. An enjoyable “anytime” whiskey that slowly reveals its charms the more you get to know it. The third in a series of Knappogue whiskeys that were distilled at Ireland's Cooley distillery (the others being a 1991 and 1990 vintage). This one is fuller in flavor than the previous two, but not as distinctive. It's a very pleasant 'anytime' dram."
5449,"<price>109<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Calvados Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Batch No. AH14), 60.9%<review>Pastry shop aromas permeate the nose: blueberry crumble with crusted brown sugar,
fresh-baked muffin, boysenberry syrup, and fragrant peaches, nectarines, and orange
peel. The palate pops with lively citrus, a surprising but not unwelcome element that
plays well with toasted almond, chestnut honey, and nutty oak flavors. It finishes with
roasted peanuts, bittersweet chocolate, and tea leaf, still retaining peppy citrus. 
"
5450,"<price>270<rating>96<whiskey>Canadian Club Chronicles 42 year old The Dock Man, 45%<review>The Chronicles collection debuted two years ago with the release of the 40 year old. This, the third annual release, incorporates a smidgen of younger rye and a dash of brandy. The nose and palate are deep and complex. Fruity and floral on the nose, with hints of raisin tarts, apple skins, and apricots. A sweet fruitiness, with mild peppers, baking spices, and a crisp, vaguely tannic backbone. Extended fruity, glowing finish."
5451,"<price>112<rating>86<whiskey>Yamazaki Bourbon Barrel, 48%<review>Very bright gold. This shows some of the warm tatami/dry grass notes seen in Yamazaki 12 year old, this time overlaid with fruit stones, banana chips, fresh persimmon, and, once it opens, cask-generated aromas of crème brûlée, cinnamon toast, caramelized sugar, and cotton candy. The palate is sweet and lush with plenty of vanilla ice cream, but there’s sufficient acidity to maintain freshness and prevent things from getting too flabby. £70"
5452,"<price>495<rating>89<whiskey>Bainbridge Yama American Single Grain Barley Mizunara Japanese Oak Cask, 45%<review>This high-end whiskey exhibits restrained oak, elegance, and delicateness, with wonderful poached pear, cereal, crème caramel, floral, and lemon chiffon cake aromas that yield to a bright beam of tart, mouthwatering citrus—clementine, lemon, and yuzu—tingling with allspice. Bright, light, and lively, but not lacking in complexity, finishing with marshmallow, toasted almond, and marzipan. Very pretty! American single grain whiskey aged in Japanese Mizunara oak casks."
5453,"<price>119<rating>86<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Kings Mountain Single Barrel, 46%<review>Catoctin Creek’s first malt whiskey, made from wash brewed by Heritage Brewing of Manassas, Va., aged in used Catoctin Creek whiskey barrels. Light floral notes, fresh-cut pencil lead, oak sawdust on the nose. Sweet and floral, but with a firm backbone of oak and dry malt, leading to a finish of candied oak: juicy-sweet but hard-cored. The profile is definitely Catoctin Creek whiskey, which is great to see in a young distillery trying something new. Well done. (344 bottles, distillery only)"
5454,"<price>22<rating>82<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch No. 1 Red Rye Finish, 40%<review>America, Walker wants your cocktails. Emma Walker that is, the blender whose signature adorns the first of these experimental expressions. Toffee Speyside nose, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, cool mint, and a pronounced grain note from Port Dundas. Orange, lime peel, lovely caramel richness, and creamy toffee through dilution. The brand’s second consecutive rye cask finish: you noticed too? Up against its sibling, JW Select Rye Cask, there are certain similarities, but this is fruitier, less intricate, and less rich and spicy."
5455,"<price>59<rating>88<whiskey>Tumblin’ Dice 4 year old Single Barrel Barrel-Proof Straight Bourbon (No. 1), 57.85%<review>The nose is redolent of tea leaves, peach skin, herbal honey throat lozenges, blueberries, brown sugar, licorice, and toasted grain. More herbaceousness hits on the palate, cooling some of the cinnamon spice of the high proof with spearmint and licorice notes; add water, and nuttiness emerges. Continued herbal flavors into the finish, which also has citrus oil and peppery spice. Strong barrel character throughout. (5,500 bottles)"
5456,"<price>229<rating>88<whiskey>The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 2015, 48%<review>Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, Jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150"
5457,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Doc 52 Straight Bourbon Whiskey, 55%<review>On the nose, cherry tart baked over a fireplace: rich red fruit with a whiff of soot and some chalky minerality. A lot of warmth on the palate, with biscotti, almond, toffee, and warm caramel apple topped with sweet vanilla cream, and chocolate ganache on the side. Good, creamy texture, with some sharp peppery tinges. A 9 year old Tennessee bourbon selected by and bottled for Doc’s Wine, Spirits and More in Memphis, Tennessee. (152 bottles)"
5458,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Gouden Carolus Single Malt, 46%<review>Produced at the De Molenberg Distillery from a mash of Gouden Carolus Tripel beer and finished in Anker beer casks following bourbon-barrel maturation. This has aromas of peach, barley, marshmallow, light toffee, hops, and warm apple pie, with dry and fragrant spices. Melon, overripe pear, white chocolate, vanilla pod, cinnamon stick, baked apple, dried orange, oak, and spices on the palate; the unfolding flavors are generous and strong."
5459,"<price>15<rating>84<whiskey>Evan Williams, 43%<review>Commonly referred to as Black Label, the color is noticeably dark for a younger,  less than 8 year old product like this. The nose takes it a step forward with burnt  brown sugar, fruit, and cinnamon. But the palate reveals its youth with a mouthful  of grains and acidity. However, it’s saved by final notes of honey, vanilla, caramel,  soft oak, and coconut. A short finish disappoints, but this is a cocktail or cola contender."
5460,"<price>191<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Kildalton, 46%<review>Not an unpeated Ardbeg, but a new initiative to raise money for the Kildalton Project which supports community projects in south Islay. Smoke, but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches, mezcal, smoked oyster, sphagnum moss, a huge hit of vetiver, and coal tar. The smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward, while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream, and mint) moves to the back. A worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause. Buy for either reason; or both. £120"
5461,"<price>44<rating>88<whiskey>Ragtime Rye, 45.2%<review>New York Distilling's 3 year old rye is made with a 72/16/12% mashbill (rye/corn/malt) and aged in 53-gallon barrels. The rye is organic and non-GMO. Nose is clean, rich with grassy, bitter rye aroma and a nice dash of mint. Mouth is smooth but assertive: bitter-minty, a bit oily, and the wood arrives near the end. Quite nicely balanced, delivers what a rye should, and would make an excellent cocktail as well."
5462,"<price>40<rating>74<whiskey>Koval Midwest Wheat, 40%<review>So that’s what wheat smells like: not much. The aromas here seem to be mostly yeast-derived, with a faint ripe fruitiness (undefined: peach, apple?) and alcohol heat, and a touch of wheat-origin sweet grass. Wheat’s in the mouth, like chewing fresh grain with some water and alcohol. It’s all there, and the finish is sweet, and it’s clean, but…that’s about all. White bread whiskey. "
5463,"<price>325<rating>96<whiskey>Compass Box The General, 53.4%<review>With a name inspired by a 1926 Buster Keaton movie, only 1,698 bottles produced, and the news that one of the two batches is more than 30 years old, the clues were there that this blend was never going to be cheap. It isn't, but it's superb, rich in flavor that screams dusty old oak office, fresh polish, and Sunday church, with spices, oak dried fruits, squiggly raisins, and a surprising melting fruit-and-nut dairy chocolate back story."
5464,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Rosebank), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, cask #4755, 43%<review>Delicately floral (lavender, rose) and perfumed, with notes of chamomile, hay, soft vanilla and gentle malt. Creamy and soothing, with a gently dry finish. Lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. A lovely aperitif. I feel Rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. With the distillery closing in 1993, now’s the time to act, and this is one of the better bottlings I’ve tasted. 
"
5465,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>Ballantine’s 21 year old Signature Oak Edition, 40%<review>Sandy Hyslop has excelled at solely blending European oak sherry cask whiskies here. A dry, spicy nose to relish: rum-raisin ice cream, wafer biscuits, fennel seeds, roasted coriander, seasoned oak, and dense fruitcake. After the Cinnamon Toast Crunch and toffee sweetness disrobe, a riot of spices cavorts across the tastebuds, bedding down to a flavor of spiced, chocolate-covered toffee bars. For cigar lovers, this demands a fine, robust smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
5466,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old, 52.9%<review>Where Batch 4 is peaty, Batch 5 is smoky, joining aromas of after-dinner mints, rich orange, fondant creams, salted caramel, and sour fruits. On sipping, mint chocolate finds accord with the nose, before a summit of smoke and pepper, then apple, milk chocolate, creamy coffee, and late black currant notes. The smoke hangs deep at the back of the throat. Good flavor trajectory and complexity, with a drying chocolate finish.(822 bottles)"
5467,"<price>53<rating>80<whiskey>Glenkeir Treasures (distilled at Fettercairn) 6 year old, 40%<review>This could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive Fettercairn single malt, but Glenkeir Treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage. Wet cardboard, starch, and savory notes on the initial nose, settling down to something fruitier and with milk chocolate. Floral, nutty, and slightly peppery on the palate, with almonds, toffee, cocoa powder, and gentle citrus fruit. Quite soft in the finish, with elegant spices and milky coffee. (Whisky Shop only) £35/500 ml"
5468,"<price>250<rating>95<whiskey>Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve (2009), 46%<review>Rich, silky, and oily in texture. Extremely well-integrated flavors loaded with ripe berries, caramelized banana, nougat, date nut bread, glazed tangerine, and maple syrup, peppered with warming cinnamon, vanilla icing, and nutmeg. Firm, dry resinous finish to balance the sweetness. I love the pot still character and the lushness that some of the port-wood aging has imparted. If anything, even richer and more lush than the previous 2007 vintage I reviewed. Another classic Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve."
5469,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Signatory 'Unchillfiltered' (distilled at Cragganmore), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%<review>Independent bottlings of Cragganmore are hard to come by, and this one is a beauty. Cragganmore is not rich, heavy, or sweet like many Speyside whiskies. This one is medium-bodied, yet firm. It is clean on the palate throughout (with a brief honeyed vanilla note before becoming dry), and it is loaded with spice and dried fruits that continue to evolve. Long, lingering, finish. The decision to forego chill-filtering certainly reveals more of this whisky’s subtle, yet persistent, complexity. 
"
5470,"<price>42<rating>84<whiskey>Buckshee Straight Rye, 45%<review>The nose starts out with orange blossom, lemon zest, licorice, iced tea, and confectioners’ sugar, set against pine forest notes and a hint of minerality. The palate is light, with orange pekoe tea, vanilla, baked apples and cloves, and more pine. The finish is also light and somewhat brief, with pleasurable notes of spice, as well as figs, brown sugar, and an overlay of white pepper. Some interesting notes on offer."
5471,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>Rittenhouse Rye 21 year old, 45%<review>Darker, chewier than the Sazerac 18. Thicker, too, with more toffee and molasses in the middle, reminiscent of demerara rum. More wood and spice on the finish. Not as pristine as the Sazerac 18 (especially regarding the fruit notes), but with plenty of complexity and sheer entertainment to warrant a score in the 90s. 
"
5472,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels 10 year old (distilled at Scapa), 43%<review>This expression from Scapa in Orkney was distilled in 2001 and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Tropical fruit and butterscotch on the sweet, light nose, with very slight smokiness on the early palate, along with spicy, milky cocoa, hazelnuts, and more tropical fruit. The finish is medium in length, with a hint of char. An easy-drinking, nicely balanced dram at a good price."
5473,"<price>78<rating>89<whiskey>Double Barrel Ardbeg & Craigellachie, 46%<review>If I had to back one of the protagonists in Douglas Laing’s latest Duel of the Phial, my money would be squarely on the Ardbeg. The nose delights with oils oozing from the chestnut flesh of a grilled kipper, coiled rope on a trawler’s deck, and hot pressed asphalt, with a gentle background note of roasted peanut and millionaire’s shortbread. Medium texture: lemon and butterscotch, delicious fruitiness, and spearmint on the mid-palate. Clean, creamy with a baked lemon finish. £49"
5474,"<price>20<rating>82<whiskey>O.Z. Tyler Bourbon, 45%<review>Wood spice dominates the nose, with citrus, floral, and tobacco barn aromas. The palate has pleasant orange peel, spice, red apple, and vanilla notes with a robust heat; however, toasted oak continues to reign. One for the wood lover.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;
Processing: Distilled in Kentucky and aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing the TerrePURE process."
5475,"<price>17<rating>86<whiskey>Buckhorn, 40%<review>Full oaky nose, with the brash power of youth. Zingy and bright, with corn, sweet and hot mint, chunky oak, and a warm, spicy-sweet finish. On the front edge of the bell curve for 4 to 6 year old bourbons; plenty of spunk. Not for someone who wants a mellow glass, this one's lively. Sourced whiskey. 
"
5476,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Islay Mist, 12 year old, 40%<review>More rounded, with greater depth when compared to the 8 year old offering. Not as medicinal and less sweet, more toffee and less honey, with more dried spice interwoven throughout. The herbs are still there, along with licorice root. Dry, burning-ember finish. Nicely balanced, which makes it my favorite of the three.
"
5477,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Mackmyra Swedish whisky 46.1%<review>Mackmyra has at long last reached the United States. It has been a growing force for some years, and is now a stocky adolescent with a personality all its own. What was challenging, salty peat is now in check, and the fruity delights are to the fore, with canned sweet pear, vanilla, cherry blossom, and lacquer on the nose. There’s a flip-flop on the palate, from melon and vanilla to dusty, peppery peat in the finish. "
5478,"<price>580<rating>93<whiskey>GlenDronach Grandeur 27 year old (Batch 10), 50.1%<review>This 27 year old expression includes whisky matured in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximénez butts and puncheons. The nose is rich and inviting, with freshly polished antique oak furniture, cherry blossom, and vanilla. Big sweet sherry notes on the palate, with wood spice, hazelnuts, and cherry liqueur-filled dark chocolate. The long finish features ripe plums, treacle, and more dark chocolate. Luscious! (2,293 bottles)"
5479,"<price>48<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 45%<review>This is a good as rye whiskey gets. It’s powerfully spicy, yet there is a calming sweetness along with soft berry and citrus fruit behind the spice. I find its oily texture very soothing, and this also marries beautifully with the spice from the rye and the resinous oak. The flavors are crisp and incredibly clean, and the 18 years in oak has added formidable depth.

5480,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Lone Whisker 12 year old, 46.9%<review>A sourced whiskey named for man’s best friend, this well-aged bourbon is layered with sweet and spiced aromas and flavors. PayDay candy bars, red Twizzlers, honey, caramel chews, and gingerbread mingle with iced tea, pipe tobacco, and peanut shells on the nose. Flavors of bitter orange, cherry soda, grape jelly, and roasted pecans are balanced by rich oak, cinnamon, and iced tea, with gingerbread spices and bittersweet chocolate on the finish."
5481,"<price>53<rating>90<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Stiùireadair, 46.3%<review>A no age statement Bunnahabhain destined to replace the existing 12 year old, matured in first and second-fill sherry casks. Raisins, fruit spice, furniture polish, and roasted nuts on the nose, along with an edge of brine. Rich and full-bodied in the mouth, with malt, sweet sherry, and cotton candy, plus cloves and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish offers red berries, lively spice, and dark chocolate. £40"
5482,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Scotia Double Cask, 46%<review>Initially aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, then finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. On the nose, ripe peaches, apricots, vanilla, caramel, and mildly smoky sherry surface. The slightly viscous palate offers more sherry, wood spices, cinnamon, salted caramel, oak, peanuts, and a hint of salt. The finish is medium in length, herbal, and drying, with sea salt."
5483,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park 1992 vintage 13 year old (Cask #1673), 57.7%<review>Richly sherried, great mouthfeel, and well-balanced. The sherry is clean, and is only one facet of this multi-dimensional whisky. Notes of lush orange and apricot, soaked in molasses and maple syrup. Fig cake and oak resin add structure and complexity. Dry, spicy cinnamon, resinous finish. (Bottled for Delilah’s, and for Bull and Bush)"
5484,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes, 1985 vintage, 43%<review>Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage.
"
5485,"<price>225<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut Greedy Angels, 50%<review>A whopping three-quarters of the spirit put in these casks was taken by greedy angels. It has a big waft of crystallized pineapple, tropical fruits, and spiky spice on the nose. On the palate, red licorice, syrupy jellied fruits, some mandarin, cherry lozenge, and tinned strawberries, and the same menthol rancio you’d kill for in a 30 year old scotch. This is Amrut's oldest-ever whisky; it's as rare as hen's teeth…and just 8 years old. Awesome. "
5486,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Uprising Pedro Ximénez Sherry Finish (Batch 2), 46%<review>The nose of this mahogany-hued ‘single-malt’ portends dense and chewy flavors of brown sugar, dates, and toasted walnuts. It’s a bit fiery on the palate, where it unleashes a rush of dried fruits, smoke, and spice. While some raw spirit character peeks through, this unconventional whiskey holds appeal for its originality, with a stout-like crescendo of coffee and mocha on the very long finish."
5487,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfiddich Fire and Cane, 43%<review>The fourth release in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this expression comprises peated and unpeated single malt, matured in bourbon barrels and then finished for 3 months in Latin American rum casks. A nose of spiced rum, vanilla, ripe pears, and pipe tobacco. Baked apple, sweet oak, and cinder toffee on the palate, with ashy smoke. Peppery sweet peat, rum, and brittle toffee in the relatively short finish. Best Value"
5488,"<price>15<rating>70<whiskey>Sailboat, 40%<review>Traces of burnt caramel add interest to an otherwise simple, overly sweet palate. A triumvirate of alcohol, chocolate toffee, and pepper. A slight bitterness is more distracting than pleasing or refreshing. Reminiscent of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup, Sailboat is just too sweet to sip solo, but adding ginger ale increases the complexity, as spirit and sweetness mingle with ginger and carbonation. It would benefit from a bit more wood. A very inexpensive whisky, though not a bargain. $20 CAD"
5489,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell 10 year old Cask-Strength Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 020), 53.35%<review>Strikingly mature and rich, yet also lively and vibrant, this whiskey tempts with a host of vanilla treats, including Nilla wafers, milkshake, and butter pecan ice cream. Lurking just beneath are deeper nutty flavors, saddle leather, crushed blueberry, and warm apple butter. The palate shows a lot of gusto and while it certainly doesn’t need water, a splash rewards by unleashing the ample oak, coupled with heaps of Peanut Chews, dried apple, and more leather on the beautifully balanced finish."
5490,"<price>44<rating>80<whiskey>The Epicurean, 46.2%<review>This is the Lowland entry into Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts collection, and on approach the nose is like sipping lemonade in a malt hopper: gristy malt, lemon, lime, honeydew melon, vanilla pods, peach, and apricot. A similarly juicy palate, gaining sweet grassy notes, Spangles, and confectioners’ sugar, before ending on a finish of dried citrus and fizzy Refreshers. True to the region, but the Epicurean makes the rest of the range look brighter, quicker, smarter, and tastier in comparison. £34"
5491,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Crown Royal Deluxe, 40%<review>Although grain changes every year due to the weather, the flavor of Crown Royal Deluxe remains consistent. The skilled blenders who make this entry-level Crown Royal use their finely tuned noses, not a recipe, to ensure this. Wood, orchard fruits, floral tones, and gallons of vanilla on the nose translate into butterscotch, peppery rye spices, and creamy vanilla fudge on the palate."
5492,"<price>75<rating>85<whiskey>A.D. Laws Secale Straight Rye, 50%<review>Same specs as the Secale Rye Single Barrel. Grassy nose, spicy hard candy, hot mint, and split-rock dryness. Dry rye grain, a tweak of bitterness, and alcohol heat. Finish is a bit oily/sticky. Good example of the modern MGP-inspired rye interpretation: grain-forward and no-nonsense."
5493,"<price>43<rating>78<whiskey>Signatory 'Unchillfiltered' (distilled at Linkwood), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%<review>Obviously aged in a sherry cask. Juicy fruit, syrupy, a bit waxy, notes of maple syrup and spice (clove, mint). Nicely soothing, but there is a trade-off here-the soft, floral beauty which makes Linkwood malt so attractive is lost somewhere behind the sherry and escapes only briefly from time to time. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)

Clynelish wax on the palate. Herbal, with lemon juice that has a little sea salt mixed
into it. Licorice and white pepper in the slightly oily finish. Price is for entire Prima &
Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (941 bottles) £20,000"
5495,"<price>55<rating>81<whiskey>Bib and Tucker Small Batch 6 year old, 46%<review>With its straw color, this looks nothing like a 6 year old, but its aroma and taste justify the age statement. Caramel-covered popcorn, cooked grains, Nutella, honey, and toasted rye bread. No one flavor overpowers another as an assortment of sweet and spice project over a chewy mouthfeel. The medium finish shows decent caramel. This is nice, but doesn’t wow the palate. Sourced whiskey."
5496,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Evolution, 50%<review>This is the second edition of Evolution, first released in 2013, and the ABV has been reduced from 57.2% to 50%. Like the first, it was matured in first-fill Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose gives vanilla, ginger, honey, tropical fruits, and milk chocolate, plus a floral note. More vanilla, milky coffee, oak, honey, toffee, and pineapple on the oily palate. Spicy caramel in the finish."
5497,"<price>33<rating>90<whiskey>Starward Two-Fold Red Wine Barrel-Finished Double Grain Blended, 40%<review>Aromatic spices, scents of bleached driftwood, and hints of bramble and blackcurrant on this blend of wheat and malt whiskies matured in Australian red wine barrels. The palate shifts quickly from white to milk chocolate, red apple, crème de cassis, peppercorn spices, and cookies, but it’s soft and gentle, finely structured, with more dark fruits coming to the fore. The finish is drying and short, with evaporating spice."
5498,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic Peated, 40%<review>Highly approachable, with soft, earthy peat on the nose, plus pineapple, honey, and vanilla. Warm leather, ashy peat, ripe pears, and discreet vanilla notes on the palate. Slightly thinner than the unpeated Classic. Relatively long in the finish, with peppery peat and ultimately, aniseed."
5499,"<price>130<rating>91<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old, 54.7%<review>Definitely one to taste. The nose offers up allspice, moderate peat smoke, pomegranate, dried peel, and ground almonds. The palate is superb; milk chocolate caramels, assertive smoke, and peppercorn, then a slow, warm slide into coffee, cocoa, and licorice, becoming lush and velvety in texture. Paradoxically, the more diluted it becomes, the thicker and more substantial it seems to taste. Long finish of coffee and chocolate. (Batch 4)"
5500,"<price>91<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice 1996 (distilled at Tomatin), 43%<review>Gordon & MacPhail’s 1996 Tomatin was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Malt, fruit fondant, black pepper, then late vanilla and fudge on the nose. Peaches and apricots on the palate, with vanilla and white pepper. The finish is spicy and medium in length, with lasting orchard fruits. £57"
5501,"<price>99<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfiddich Cask of Dreams, 48.8%<review>A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak, then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. With water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely whisky."
5502,"<price>336<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glen Grant), Cask #3480, 37 year old, 51.5%<review>I am amazed by how many old, sherried Glen Grant whiskies have been released to the market in the past ten years. (Did the distillery owners at the time also own sherry bodegas, or what?) Anyway, some of these have been dark, decadent, and delicious, and I’ll put this whisky in that category. Chestnut colored, with lush fruit, treacle, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, roasted walnuts, and cherry cough syrup. A complex, well-structured whisky. 
"
5503,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Johnny Drum Private Stock, 50.5%<review>Plenty of color, and the nose says it ain’t lying. Sharp warehouse oak aroma puts an edge on an authoritative nose of honey, Indian pudding, spicy hard candy, and old-fashioned root beer, the not-too-sugary kind. Fiery and bold on the tongue as oak roars from start to finish, but the sweetness builds sip-by-sip: cornbread, buckwheat honey, King syrup, and a teasy bit of citrus peel. Long finish as the oak dies down. At this price, let’s keep it our secret. Sourced whiskey."
5504,"<price>95<rating>87<whiskey>Box The Challenger, 48.2%<review>One part whisky from 40-liter sherry casks, using peated and unpeated batches, to three parts peated whisky aged in regular bourbon casks. Damp peat smoke, mint toffees, and a savory note on the nose, with a distinct mintiness continuing on the palate. A hot, smoky core is chaperoned with flavors of dry banana, vanilla essence, and white plums, developing a late creamy texture and a fresh minty finish. Surely, this will be approved by dentists everywhere? 837 SEK"
5505,"<price>160<rating>84<whiskey>Syndicate 58/6 Premium, 43%<review>An odd non-age stated blend that uses a solera system to get a drop of the original 1958 blend into the mix. The blend is then finished for four years in oloroso casks. It's a bit of blending gymnastics. Very sherry influenced, with marionberry jam, malt, salt, and oak. The integration and flavors are nice, but it all feels a bit muted. A medium length and dry finish shows off some of the younger spirit in the mix. (U.S. only)"
5506,"<price>353<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Tomatin) 45 year old, 51.6%<review>This veteran example of Tomatin was distilled in November 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. The outturn was
175 bottles. Uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose, along with gunpowder tea. Big, old sherry notes on the full palate, with raisins, sultanas, and a sprinkling of black pepper. Fruity, notably spicy, and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230"
5507,"<price>95<rating>79<whiskey>Thomson 17 year old<review>Thomson has discovered and bottled stocks from the Willowbank distillery, which closed in the 90s. It was, almost certainly, the world’s most southern distillery, located at Dunedin, a South Island city populated by Scots (the name is an amalgam of Dundee and Edinburgh). The whisky? Not bad at all. Sweet, edgy, prickly, with pineapple and kumquat, banana, and salt and pepper. "
5508,"<price>115<rating>90<whiskey>Distillery 291 E Cherry and Peach Wine-Barrel Finished Bourbon (Batch 6), 61.3% <review>The nose is earthy, chalky, and herbal, with notes of caramel and baking spice. The palate shows its proof well, with lots of balanced oak and bitter herbs, plus cherry and orange. The finish has flavors of bitter chocolate, coffee ice cream, burnt almond, dried orange slices, and a deft influence of toasted oak. This is a big, robust whiskey, with impressive complexity and plenty to like. (303 bottles)"
5509,"<price>29<rating>93<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2005 Vintage (Barrel #292), 43.3%<review>Complex fruit (clementine, pineapple, golden raisin) balanced nicely with honey, vanilla custard, and dusty corn, along with a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. An extremely versatile whiskey with its medium weight, easy to embrace personality, and subtle charms. Perennially one of the best values in whiskey. Editor's Choice and Value Pick."
5510,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Three Chord 12 year old Twelve Bar Reserve Barrel-Proof Straight Bourbon (Batch 0007), 53.5%<review>Butter pecan ice cream, peanuts in the shell, oily grain, milk chocolate, cooked orange, cherry tart, and blueberries on the nose. The palate is spiced, nutty, and chewy, with milk chocolate, orange soda, cherry cough drop, baking spice, brown sugar, a hint of eucalyptus, and loads of peanuts. More rich spice, chocolate, and fruit on the finish, along with peanut butter, spearmint, and generous oak. Not a hair out of place."
5511,"<price>25<rating>78<whiskey>American Born Moonshine Original, 51.5%<review>Lots of green notes in the nose of this mason jar variety of moonshine, including green apple, green bean, and wheat grass. Strong brewer’s yeast and cornmeal round things out in a highly aromatic nose. For the proof, the entry is remarkably soft and sweet, tasting like buttered cornbread. Fire and spice aren’t far behind, with black pepper, white pepper, and charred Cracker Jack. Long, dry, and slightly hot finish with a hint of popcorn and green bean."
5512,"<price>190<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenburgie) 25 year old, 49.3%<review>Full gold. Big, robust, and sweetly fragrant, with honeysuckle, stewing elderflower. There’s some oak, but it’s not dominant. The palate starts creamy, then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. It melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. There’s coconut and cassia on the end. You lose the sweetness with water, but you get more blossom and oak. Personally I’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130"
5513,"<price>119<rating>86<whiskey>Bowmore Tempest IV/Dorus Mor, 55.1%<review>Tempest to the world, Dorus Mor in the U.S., this has an intensely salty start that’s
like being slapped by a wave on Bowmore’s harbor wall. That marine note
continues: samphire, clams with a squeeze of lemon. Water brings out wet clay.
The palate is equally briny, but with a sprig of lavender, then soft fruits
wreathed in peat smoke. It’s tense and coiled, with real energy when neat, but
it’s best like that, so deal with the heat."
5514,"<price>76<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt, 54%<review>Have you ever noticed how some distilleries never appear under independent labels? They say they put a teaspoon of whisky from another distillery in each barrel; no longer a single malt. Whether they really do, who knows? So here is a blended malt with 99.99 percent of the whisky from one distillery. This has no peat and is sweet, honeyed, and rich, with vanilla, banana, lime sherbet, and tropical fruits. Almost certainly from Speyside…but where? £50"
5515,"<price>96<rating>86<whiskey>Highland Park Harald, 40%<review>Harald Fairhair was King of Norway and a major figure in Viking history. This Warrior variant takes us closer to Highland Park’s traditional DNA, with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal, with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. Lively fresh fruits, newly-baked cake, nutmeg, and ginger figure on the palate. The spicy finish is relatively long, with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml"
5516,"<price>330<rating>95<whiskey>Canadian Club Chronicles 43 year old The Speakeasy, 45%<review>The third in the Chronicles series offers a slightly closed nose that soon shows high esters, cinnamon, and eggnog, while hints of mint hide among old dry barn boards in a gorgeous, creamy palate. Mild caramels fade into peppery heat, restrained grassy herbs, and pulling tannins. Burley tobacco leaves replace Canadian Club’s signature dark fruits. Finishes long, hot, and vaguely dry."
5517,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Method & Madness French Limousin Oak-Finished, 46%<review>
Irish Distillers experimented with 14 year old single malt (sourced from elsewhere, as Midleton Distillery doesn’t make it), matured in bourbon barrels with a parcel finished in French oak. The nose is nutty, with granola, shortbread, pecans, and a smattering of ground pepper. Smooth flavors of ice cream cone, blossom honey, vanilla, ginger, pepper, and long-lasting spices. Toffee, roasted nuts, cinnamon, malt, and blackening spices carry from the late palate into the finish."
5518,"<price>122<rating>85<whiskey>Port Askaig, 25 year old, 45.8%<review>Still in the same vein as its 17 year old sibling reviewed above, but it’s softer, mellower, with more wood impact (especially on the nose and back end of the palate) and tea leaves. Perhaps even some mild tobacco. Darker sugars in this one (molasses?) rather than honey, and more berried fruit along with the citrus, which struggles to reveal itself. Dry, resinous finish. An enjoyable dram, even if the wood outstays its welcome. But if you have to pick between the two expressions, go for the 17 year old and pocket the change with a smile on your face. Price: £75"
5519,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel #16A113), 46.4%<review>This rye has a lot going on. The palate ranges from herbs, caramel, cotton candy, honeysuckle, and rose petals, to chocolate, malt, black pepper, honey, and slightly burnt pizza crust. The whiskey sits on the palate, richly giving red fruit and pepper spice with a slight hint of banana on the end. The taste is magnificent. If the medium finish was just a little longer, this would venture into greatness."
5520,"<price>120<rating>84<whiskey>Vintage Bourbon, 23 year old, 47%<review>Dark and mysterious. Thick and chewy. Notes of fig cake, glazed fruit, oak resin, tobacco and cedar. Bold, spicy finish balances the chewy sweetness. A digestif, if not an entire meal. 
"
5521,"<price>81<rating>87<whiskey>Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1992, 43%<review>Equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. Out comes Manuka honey, Greek yogurt, and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty, polished note. There’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (Dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). The finish is long with some Brazil nut. Try frozen with dessert."
5522,"<price>62<rating>79<whiskey>Littlemill, 12 year old, 43%<review>Quite palate-coating for a Lowlander, with sweet notes of vanilla malt, grist, honey and marshmallow. More subtle notes of cut grass, linseed oil, rubber erasers, and chalky antacid tablets. A peculiar-tasting whisky. 
"
5523,"<price>55<rating>83<whiskey>The Balvenie Signature 12 year old Batch #1, 43%<review>Good, straightforward, moderately sherried Balvenie. Classic honeyed notes combine with vanilla, ripe barley, glazed citrus, apricot marmalade, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A nice entry level Balvenie, a solid effort."
5524,"<price>120<rating>93<whiskey>Aberfeldy 18 year old French Red Wine Cask-Finished (Batch 2920), 43%<review>

Aging scotch in a secondary cask is tricky, and tinkering with a whisky that has already achieved 18 years of age is even riskier. This well-matured Aberfeldy spent its final months in red wine casks from Bordeaux under the bold vision and deft hand of malt master Stephanie Macleod. As a result, it soars above its station. Never intrusive, the red wine finish suggests Fig Newtons and dried cherries, building upon Aberfeldy’s classic honey-vanilla profile to evoke strawberry shortcake and flavors of jam and clotted cream on a fresh-baked scone. A complex, mature, and moreish whisky at an excellent price. Number 10 in the 2020 Top 20"
5525,"<price>175<rating>95<whiskey>Willett Family Reserve, (Barrel #81L31), 25 year old, 45.1%<review>Very mellow, silky in texture, and on the sweet side for mature bourbon. It’s not bold like Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old, which has much more oak spice and resin. Willett’s foundation of molasses and toffee is accentuated by candied fruit, fig, dusty corn, and tobacco, with mint tea, cinnamon, and vanilla peppered throughout. It’s perilously drinkable. I am impressed how these 20-plus year old Willett rye and bourbon whiskeys maintain their balance and keep the oak in check. Splendid ultra-mature bourbon. (Less than 100 bottles of this were sent to California, and not all the same barrel. Happy hunting.)
"
5526,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Amrut Peated, 46%<review>Smoked meat, paprika, cumin, peppercorn, and star anise, amid fragrant smoke and maple bacon. The flavors are supremely fruity with tangerine, marmalade, lime zest, and pineapple juice. Among the fruit is a cascade of aromatic spices, before the interjection of a most compelling sour fruit note, and the smokiness takes charge. It’s certainly no Islay mimic, this terrific Indian whisky demonstrates it has the courage of its own convictions."
5527,"<price>25000<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1948 (distilled at Glen Grant, Cask 2154), 48.6%<review>Smoky sherry, damp burlap, lanolin, then orange blossom on the nose, with a hint of glass cleaner. The palate yields juicy damsons, followed by aniseed, bitter chocolate, and oak tannins. Char and faint smoke in the extremely long finish. (50 bottles in U.S.)"
5528,"<price>520<rating>96<whiskey>Redbreast 25 year old, 53%<review>Celebrating the 60th anniversary of a Parisian retailer, this represents the most mature Redbreast of the modern era. Rich dark prunes, papaya, and the aroma of polished antique furniture. Treacle, oily and weighty, baked apple, Black Forest gateaux, char, and sizzling spices, with new flavors appearing minute by minute. Water encourages cherry to the nose and pomegranate to the taste buds. The faithful will respond to the call. (540 bottles, La Maison du Whisky only) €490"
5529,"<price>137<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Fruit Bonbons (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989, 66%<review>One of four Spring 2013 single cask releases from Wemyss Malts, Fruit Bonbons was distilled at Glen Garioch in 1989 and bottled during 2012. The out-turn was 325 bottles. Homemade lemonade and a dash of table salt on the early nose, then heather, ginger, and finally the sweetness of icing sugar and fudge. Apples coated in cinnamon, nutmeg, caramel, and dark treacle on the palate. The finish dries, from apple pie to oak and plain chocolate. £90"
5530,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Brothership Irish-American Whiskey 10 year old, 45%<review>Grassy, grainy, and floral on the nose, with hints of citrus, grape soda, and apples. The palate is creamy, fruity, sweet, and light, with creamed corn, milk chocolate, and grassy and floral notes. There’s a hint of spice and a milk chocolate finish. An interesting flavor profile, but the blend of bourbon and Irish single malt whiskey never quite comes together as a cohesive whole."
5531,"<price>630<rating>86<whiskey>Bowmore 23 year old Port Wood, 50.8%<review>The ruby color gives the port maturation away, as does the nose: all plum crumble, stewed rhubarb, and caramelized orchard fruits. It’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. The palate is hot, with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. All well-integrated and at its best with a little water."
5532,"<price>796<rating>85<whiskey>Jura Feith A’ Chaorainn 1976 Vintage, 46%<review>The name of this limited-edition bottling translates as ‘the lands around the rowan,’ and the component whisky has been matured in three, fresh-run American white oak hogsheads. Tinned peaches, a hint of smoke, and developing cream soda on the nose. Soft toffee and ultimately, chimney soot. The palate is full and fruity, with Brazil nuts, drying quite rapidly, with coriander notes. Dark chocolate and licorice characterize the finish. (500 bottles). £500"
5533,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey> Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 56.5%<review>This is the 15th Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky, with kippers, charcuterie, and bonfire embers, offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate, smoke blends with vanilla, green apples, and licorice, plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery, ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (Individual reviewer rating: 91)"
5534,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin 12 year old French Oak Finish, 46%<review>Exclusive to North America, this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years, and then finished in French oak casks for a further 3 years. The casks originally contained red wine from the Bacalhoa winery. Before use by Tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. Peaches, vanilla, milk chocolate, and ginger on the nutty nose, with new-mown hay. Full-bodied, with toffee apples, black pepper, and cloves. Lingering warm spices in the finish. (12,000 bottles)"
5535,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Adnams Rye Malt, 47%<review>A creamy and spicy nose, slightly nutty, with hints of mixed peel and malt biscuits. As it warms in the glass, a lovely bouquet of toffee, hazelnut, cinnamon, and nutmeg emerges. A thick, malty mouthfeel of toffee and cinnamon finds harmony between the sweetness, crisp rye, and fresh green edge of the spices. The finish has citrus and herbal notes, and a long spiciness with a touch of mint. (Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
5536,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>A.D. Laws Secale Mash 2nd Fill Oak Rye (Batch BBL #4X), 50%<review>The oak is nicely subdued and integrated here, allowing buttered fruits to show through—baked spiced apple and poached pear—laced with spearmint and bay leaf. The creamy palate is nicely balanced with baking spices of cinnamon and clove and hints of pepper, giving way to a pleasantly drying, chalky finish. Price is per 375 ml."
5537,"<price>77<rating>87<whiskey>Springbank Green 13 year old, 46%<review>This is the second ‘Green’ release from Springbank, denoting the use of organic barley, following on from a 12 year old in 2014. This variant has been fully matured in sherry casks and 9,000 bottles are available. White pepper, ozone, and wet sand on the early nose. Ultimately, cocoa powder, baked apple, and sultanas. The palate is initially very sweet and spicy, with salt and fruity sherry developing. The finish is medium to long, warming, with a salty tang."

Though anchored in earthy and woodsy aromas of birch and soil, tropical fruits also burst forth from the glass: guava, kiwi, pineapple, mango, and jackfruit, ripe and ready to be enjoyed. They carry through to the palate, along with a touch of citrus, Cherry Coke syrup, roasted pecans, and ample spice, and are persistent into the mouth-coating finish, which counterbalances cloying flavors with charred nuts and oak."
5539,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Montgomerie's 13 year old 1989 Vintage (distilled at Macallan), 46%<review>Straw gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a bouquet of flowers, honey, soft fruit, and vanilla. Light to medium in body but mouth-coating. Honey, flowery fruit gum drop flavors, eventually turning dry and gently spicy, with a polished oak finish."

After Eight mints, Rolo toffees, spring florals, clean and creamy, plus some wood combine to produce an appealing nose. One sip confirms that this is gorgeously honeyed, layered, thick, and creamy, with heather honey, sweet oak, and ripe fruits, especially orange and mango. The finish is short, drying, sweet, and the only weak spot in an otherwise decent composition."

Room temperature aromas speak of toffee, lime zest, menthol, waxy foliage, and pronounced grain notes. Straight from the freezer, there are cornflakes, beeswax, caramel, vanilla, sharp citrus, sugared apple, and a hint of nutmeg. Deliciously tasty dram for your night’s watch. Best Value"

The palate is brawny and robust—it practically eats water—and swells with mint, licorice, root beer, black pepper, baking spice, espresso, and grape Robitussin. The lengthy finish is peppery and rich, with oak, herbs, baking spice, tea leaves, and dark chocolate."

The competition is fierce for young, big, oily, heavily peated whiskies: Kilchoman, Connemara Turf Mor, BenRiach Birnie Moss. This, though, is good enough to mix it in that sort of company. The peat growls like a Harley-Davidson, punches pepper and peat throughout, but best of all, it flicks licorice and hickory kisses just like a real life Laphroaig. Chapter 11 isn’t quite in that league yet…but it’s certainly moving in the right direction. £65 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"

Floral rye grain spice bursts from the nose along with cedar plank and graphite. The entry is thick and sweet, with maple syrup, young oak, and rye spice. Things don't heat up until the end of the mid-palate where a dash of heat drives a long, spicy finish. An interesting mix of flavors that could benefit from a little more complexity."

A whiff of early earthiness gives way to pear drops, honey, vanilla, and resin on the nose. Pears, pineapple, caramel, and vanilla on the slightly waxy, spicy palate. Slowly drying in the medium-length finish, with peppery licorice and a hint of char. (3,972 bottles)"

The outturn is 342 bottles. The nose is fleetingly herbal; then offers crème de citron, turning to tinned peaches in syrup, and finally pine and peppery caramel. Silky-smooth in the mouth, spicy, with lemon and digestive biscuits. Freshly-squeezed lemon lingers in the chili and chocolaty finish. £78"

5549,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Creek Water American Whiskey, 50%<review>Sweet kettle corn and caramel-covered nuts on the nose, along with a smoky and woody aroma—dry toasted wood on a fire. The palate is led by sugary grain and wood char, with caramel corn and grilled corn on the cob, along with a hint of wood spice. It’s cloying and sweet on the finish, yet retains strong oakiness. Distilled from a bourbon mash and “finished” with toasted wood chips using a proprietary technology."
5550,"<price>135<rating>86<whiskey>Blackadder Single Cask #1101 (distilled at Longmorn) 1972 Vintage, 31 year old, 45% ABV<review>A big and sappy Longmorn, with notes of chewy toffee, juicy oak, candied fruit, sandalwood, citrus and even some distant smoke. The standard distillery issue of Longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in Speyside with its rich, malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. Aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody, citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. While not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked, there’s a lot going on here to entertain the palate. And although one could argue that the sherry is a bit extreme, the equally extreme dry, spicy oak notes provide ample contrast.

Golden syrup laced with strands of citrus swim within a smooth, thickly textured malt. A rich sweetness spills over, unctuous with sweet honey and nuts over a base layer of spice. Confident, self-assured, expressive whiskey."

New-mown grass, ripe apples, brine, and a whiff of Arbroath smokies on the nose. Citrus fruit, spices, and milk chocolate on the palate, with sherry lending gravitas. The finish is sweet, full, and lengthy, with brine returning at the last. £20 (350 ml)"

There’s much complexity to be explored here, with a whole spice cabinet tumbling out on the palate, dusting black tea, Cherry Coke, pecans, espresso, and taut oak with its clouds of blooming flavor. The finish expresses lovely barrel char, red chiles, coffee beans, herbaceous pops of licorice, and a lingering incense quality. Enchanting. (1,000 bottles)"
5554,"<price>199<rating>86<whiskey>Aultmore 21 year old, 46%<review>Light amber with that touch of acetone, along with marzipan, green apple, fruit blossom, and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width, while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again, a lovely, almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate.

5556,"<price>47<rating>91<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 115, 45%<review>Smooth, with gently layered sweet notes; nicely balanced. The least amount of oak and just a peppering of cinnamon and mint influence compared to the other four releases. It’s the most versatile of the four too.Not as complex as the “Rye 125”, but it makes up for this with its inviting drinkability and balance. Price is per 375 ml."

and top notes of acacia honey on the nose. Surprisingly nimble on the palate, with
apple, waves of sherry, black cherry jelly, and a gentle buildup of spice, then caramel,
dark sugar, vanilla, and red apple in later phases, though it is still light on its feet. A
smooth clean finish propels more vigorous spice notes across the palate. (Travel

His distillate-driven whiskey is light, perfumed, floral, and ripe with succulent fruits of Galia melon, apricots, and citrus pith. A smooth, creamy mouthfeel of barley sugars, dried banana, and lime zest ends with light vanilla sponge and orange frosting. Sucked Jaffa segments make for a quick finish. The most distinctive of the Whisky Makers trio, where the grain and pot still contributions are clearly evident. €70"

Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance.

5561,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Hibiki, 12 year old, 43%<review>Well-rounded, solid malt backbone, and very drinkable. These are the main characteristics of this impressive blend. Honeysuckle, vanilla-coated malt and fruit (pineapple upside down cake, lemon tart, plum, bramble) are the primary flavors. Ripe barley, marzipan, beeswax, and clove round out the palate. Gentle, soothing finish. Suntory can make a 12 year old blend this good with just two malt distilleries? Scotland, are you taking notice?"

Just slightly nippy when neat. The palate is equally intense, but with a central sweetness. Water cuts down this razor-sharp intensity, adding a softer mid-palate texture, while the finish remains slightly mineraly. A decent aperitif Bunna. £97"
5563,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 12 year old, 1993 Vintage, 48%<review>One of the biggest Birthday Bourbons to date. This whiskey was aged on the top corner of a warehouse where the temperature extremes are at their greatest. The greater the temperature extreme, the greater the impact of the barrel. The wood is immediately noticeable on the nose and palate-there are plenty of concentrated dried spice notes throughout. Dried vanilla, mint, fiery cinnamon, cedar, and assorted fruits are sweetened and calmed by notes of maple syrup and toffee. Until about mid-palate, that is. Then, another wave of dried spices kicks in, remaining through the finish. For serious bourbon drinkers.

It’s sweet, relatively gentle compared to previous releases, and quite fragrant (bordering on perfumed—especially on the nose). Creamy vanilla coats the palate, with suggestions of coconut macaroon and marzipan. Dried spice (cinnamon, mint) and drying oak on the finish keep the sweetness in check."

With it, Highwood skillfully created a sumptuous, limited-edition bottling that is as sweet, smooth, and creamy as French vanilla ice cream, and richer in fresh clean wood than a carpentry shop. Dried cloves and red cedar balance real maple syrup and butterscotch which, in turn, dissolve into sweet white grapefruit. (Alberta only) C$52"
5566,"<price>34<rating>93<whiskey>Black Bottle, 10 year old, 43%<review>Black Bottle is unique in that it combines seven different Islay whiskies with grain whisky. This produces a whisky with a beautifully rounded Islay character that will satisfy the discriminating “peat-head,” the drinkability of a blended scotch, and plenty of complexity. For a blend, there’s heft to the whisky. I enjoy the interplay between the peat smoke, brine, seaweed, its firm, malty foundation and pleasingly dry finish.

The only wheated recipe bourbon in the 2011 Antique Collection, and a very good one at that. Higher in strength than last year’s offering (which was 63.3%), but very similar (and equally as impressive). The most elegant and smoothest of this collection, with layered sweetness (honey, caramel, marzipan, maple syrup), fig, blackberry preserve, hint of green tea, and just the right amount of spice for balance (nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa). "

5571,"<price>100<rating>81<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Four Wood, 47.2%<review>Aged in American oak, and then finished in maple, sherry, and portwood. The nose is intriguing and entertaining, but the palate loses me. At the beginning, it’s sweet to the point of bordering on cloying, and then there’s an emergence of flavors (wood spice, stewed fruit, caramel, etc.) that turns very busy and lacks integration. The flavors just don’t play well with each other. To me, the whiskey is trying too hard to impress and achieves the opposite."
5572,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 9 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 2010 (distilled at Ardmore, peated), 53%<review>This bruiser is not afraid to show its softer side to the world. Earthy wet turf smoke, grilled bacon fat, faint vanilla, menthol, and brand new erasers make quite a statement. But inside it’s all about a creamy, light vanilla base with aniseed, clove, ginger, and smoky bacon that capitulate to fruitier elements of banana and honeydew, which retreat with a drying, spicy finish."
5573,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Wood’s Alpine Rye (Batch #2), 49%<review>Now here’s an interesting mashbill: 73% malted rye, 13.5% chocolate malt, and 13.5% cherry-smoked malt. Nose is an arresting mix of bitter, grassy rye and smoky dark chocolate; abrupt, but it grows on you. It’s all there on the palate, too: rye oil, sweet malt, cherry smoke, pipe tobacco, raw oak. This is rambunctious stuff, with an intense but not hot finish, a very craft-beer whiskey. Unlike similarly shouty bottlings, this one has something to say as it shouts."
5574,"<price>400<rating>91<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare, 46%<review>This is much more muscular than the regular, un-haunted Blue Label. It delivers a multitude of flavors—butter toffee, sweet smoke, citrus peel, and dry spices—tantalizingly peeling off layer after layer, building a slow crescendo to a peak of spices and bitter citrus. Mouth drawing with caramel, apple, pear, and sherbet, a mid-palate of zesty orange and baking spices before topping out with bitter peels, grapefruit, smoke, and sour hard candy."

Indeed, enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm, smoky, charred oak finish. (U.S. only)"

Chocolate-covered peanuts, walnut, and cocoa on the palate, with peppery spices, raisin, date, and crème brûlée, then a dry finish of dark chocolate cookies, praline, and further spice.

Fragrant, peppery peat on the early nose, brine and fabric Band-Aids. Ultimately, leathery orange. Smooth and supple on the palate, with intense, smoky fresh fruit giving way to quite dry spices. The relatively long finish yields drying peat, plain chocolate, and developing licorice. £80"
5578,"<price>58<rating>89<whiskey>Balcones True Blue 100, 50%<review>Made from roasted Hopi blue corn. The nose says bourbon—sweet, corn, faint maple—but with big notes of stone fruits. It's lush. Mouth veers off in another direction with floury corn, oaked complexity, an herbal component, like crushed stems of wildflowers, and cinnamon/allspice notes. The finish is suddenly mellow, with a seductive creaminess high in the back palate. Even at a young 50%, never really fiery. Wonderfully complex, and not over-oaked; beautiful stuff."
5579,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dalmore) 13 year old 2000 Cask #6952, 53.5%<review>Remarkably pale in color, this Exclusive Malt is a rare peated Dalmore. Peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose, with just a touch of sweetness behind it. The taste is much better than the smell, with the addition of smoke to the peat, intertwined with honey, salt, citrus, and ginger spice. The finish is slightly acidic and dry, far less satisfying than the mid-palate. There’s a reason why Dalmore doesn’t peat, but this release is still fascinating. (U.S. only)"
5580,"<price>195<rating>83<whiskey>Ardmore 25 year old, 51.4%<review>Ardmore is a rising star in the world of single malt. Until four years ago it was little known in its own right, its main purpose being as a key malt in Teacher’s. Then Ardmore Traditional was released, and it’s been winning over drinkers ever since. That malt is a delicatessen whisky: smoky, oily, and savory, a unique Highland malt with much to recommend it. This is a different proposition altogether. It’s clean and sweet, with pineapple candy, dusty and almost incense-like spices, and a liberal dose of sweet peat. Some citrus notes, too. The peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. There’s talk of this becoming a permanent part of the Ardmore portfolio. Let’s hope so: it’s further proof that Ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed.

5581,"<price>40<rating>96<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, 1994 vintage, 47%<review>A crisp, robust, very dynamic bourbon. Amber-orange marmalade color. Spicy, with notes of cinnamon, spearmint, and Earl Grey tea. The spice is balanced nicely by thick toffee, rhum agricole, caramel apple, and bright citrus, with a polished leather finish. There have been some great Birthday Bourbons, but I think this is the best one to date. A whiskey deserving classic status.

Creamy on the nose, with malt, toasted cereal, white pepper, nutmeg, and, ultimately, mulled wine. A substantial mouthfeel, with honey, slightly smoky red wine notes, raspberry jam, and fruit spice.

5583,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2009 Vintage, 43.3%<review>Floral and minty on the nose, with dusty cedar chest and earth over red and yellow apple. The palate offers a decent concentration of flavors, with citrus oil, apricot, and mouthwatering juiciness. It’s nicely layered and well-balanced, but short on the finish. This whiskey has ranged widely over the years, and as a single barrel selection your experience may vary."
5584,"<price>88<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1997 vintage 12 year old, 46%<review>More mature peated Bunnahabhain Islay whiskies are emerging (like this one). Indeed, tarry, peat ash notes are evident throughout this one (especially on the finish!), along with nutty toffee, nougat, smoked olive, glazed ginger, and candied lime. Pretty even-keeled, not as medicinal and aggressive as its cousins on the southern end of the island. The smoke and layered sweet notes balance nicely. If you’re looking to ease your way into smoky Islay whiskies, this would be a good start."
5585,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Chicken Cock 8 year old, 45%<review>It begins with corn pudding, savory and sweet, developing into cornbread, cookie dough, and tapioca pudding. This is followed by cinnamon bread, raw walnut, and malt. Around mid-palate, a dominating spice kicks in. This spice remains toward the finish, where the cinnamon just pleasantly sits there. Fun sipper."
5586,"<price>220<rating>89<whiskey>The Macallan 21 year old Fine Oak, 43%<review>Even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. However, by the time the whisky reaches mid-palate, the dried fruits, dried spices, and general wood notes become prominent, preventing the whisky from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. It’s still a very fine whisky, but not as good as the 15, regardless of price."
5587,"<price>354<rating>88<whiskey>Celtic Cask Ocht 8, 46%<review>A 23 year old single malt from 1991 finished in French oak Ànima Negra casks from Mallorca, producing a dark, ruby colored whiskey. Rich and earthy: raisins, treacle, strawberry Jell-O, sawdust on dunnage floors, gingerbread, and traces of peppermint. Early creaminess is swept aside by intensely fruity waves of blackberry, blueberry, strawberry, grapefruit, and Seville orange that draw the mouth. Sweet Jaffa cake centers emerge later. Soft, never boisterous, and finishes with dry heat and fig paste (334 bottles). €325"
5588,"<price>115<rating>85<whiskey>Lonach (distilled at Carsebridge), 1063 vintage, 43 year old, 43%<review>A rare bottling indeed, from this now defunct grain distillery. Very tropical, with a macaroon and vanilla cream foundation. Complementary notes of marshmallow, crème brulee, honey, and pineapple. Surprisingly vibrant for a 43 year old whisky and, while expressing sweeter notes, not at all cloying (the grain whisky aspects actually help here). Soothing and distinctive. Great price, too!"
5589,"<price>2880<rating>89<whiskey>Highland Park 1976 Vintage, 49.1%<review>This is a recent addition to the portfolio, and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen American oak butts and hogsheads. These have given an out-turn of 893 bottles. Freshly-grated ginger, white pepper, and melons on the nose. Soft fruit and spices feature on the palate, with honey and coconut oil, plus background peat smoke. Lively spices, soft oak, and hazelnuts in the finish."
5590,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft 12 year old, 43%<review>Nicely balanced, with interwoven soft vanilla, cinnamon, and citrus, all on a bed of light toffee and caramel. More subtle notes of marzipan, tropical fruit, and soft oak add complexity. Traditional in style, with a friendly demeanour. A good bourbon to have on hand, as it is very versatile. I would have preferred this bottled at 45-50%, but this will do just fine as it is. A new regular bottling."
5591,"<price>23<rating>84<whiskey>Alberta Premium, 40%<review>Sweet nose with a hint of soft-boiled egg, digestive biscuit, and cedar (nowhere near as nasty as it might sound!) Warming orange peel notes, toffee, rye grassiness, a trace of horehound, and light, oaky vanilla make a sweet but somewhat angular mouthful. Finish is a bit edgy and boozy; the weakest link in the glass. A bit of water helps the finish a lot. Nothing sticks out too much; a good whisky. (Canada only.) C$24"
5592,"<price>25<rating>75<whiskey>Heaven Hill Trybox Series Rye, 62.5%<review>This is new make from the Rittenhouse Rye mashbill, unaged, right off the still. Yeasty mash notes come through strongly, with a big nose of rye and corn underneath. It smells fresh, and alive. Wow, that’s powerful stuff. Much hotter than the Trybox Corn, this one is on fire with rye spice; it’s got me breaking a sweat! A bit of water brings out more grain notes, and some tempering sweetness, but it’s still no pussycat. Cleanly powerful."
5593,"<price>52<rating>81<whiskey>Royal Lochnagar 12 year old, 40%<review>Diageo’s smallest distillery and another that has worm tubs. The character here is grassy: think hay and straw rather than lawn clippings. There’s just a hint of cereal behind, and a fresh, roasted spiciness. The palate has good central sweetness where you just get a hint of fruit. Light and fresh, and a good afternoon dram. £33"
5594,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Blaum Bros. Straight Rye, 50%<review>Rose petal, orange pekoe tea, and grandma’s perfume earmark this as a somewhat youthful rye, with white pepper and cinnamon Trident gum accompanying the floral aromas. The palate weaves together heaps of cinnamon, clove, sandalwood spice, dried flower sachet, and chamomile, with generous oak balancing the confectionary notes of circus peanuts candies and Pixy Stix. Quite distinctive—and likely divisive."
5595,"<price>113<rating>83<whiskey>BenRiach Sauternes Wood Finish 16 year old, 46%<review>Lovely golden honey color. Lush and sweet (the Sauternes impact is obvious), with honey-drenched apricot, sultana, and lemon gum drops. Vanilla, candied nuts, and subtle botanicals round out the palate. Decent oak grip on the finish keeps the whisky from being too cloying."
5596,"<price>380<rating>89<whiskey>Ballantine’s 30 year old, 40%<review>The nose unravels with milk chocolate, thick hazelnut spread, and a slender twist of orange peel, though that delectable goodness is evenly balanced with peppermint patties and detectable light, floral top notes. This has a lush softness, with a perceptibly slow crescendo of flavors incorporating caramel toffee, popcorn, and chocolate praline. It’s beautifully integrated with a smooth, dense texture, and releases its grip reluctantly with just a whisper of a peppermint reprise."
5597,"<price>101<rating>87<whiskey>Adelphi Breath of Islay 13 year old, 56.6%<review>The latest bottling of “Breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. There’s the smell of old waxed walking boots, wet moss, damp earth, crushed bog foliage — heather, bog myrtle — burlap sacking, and a hastily smothered fire. The smoke is well controlled all the way, which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. Robust, hairy, and uncompromising, this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65 "
5598,"<price>15<rating>85<whiskey>Ancient Ancient Age, 10 year old, 43%<review>Not overly challenging. Stylish and very easy to embrace. I would introduce a new bourbon drinker to this kind of bourbon. Pleasingly sweet, with honeyed vanilla, graham cracker, candy corn, dates, and golden raisin. Subtle spice (cinnamon, mint, cocoa, and nutmeg), leading to a smooth, silky finish. I would love to see this at 45% ABV or even higher, as it comes across almost too soft. But for this price, I’m not complaining. A great value.

5599,"<price>120<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Garioch 1994 Vintage, 53.9%<review>The latest release from Glen Garioch is a limited edition 1994 vintage, produced when the distillery still boasted working floor maltings, and is therefore more peaty than spirit subsequently distilled. Pear drops, vanilla, and developing caramel on the nose. Freshly-opened cigarette packets, and, in time, brown paper and vinegar. Quite dry and austere on the palate, with stem ginger and subtle smoke. Persistently spicy in the medium-length finish, with an elusive late flurry of smoky, chocolate caramel. "
5600,"<price>68<rating>83<whiskey>Pemberton Valley Organic Single Malt, 44%<review>Micro-distiller Tyler Schramm studied distilling at Scotland’s Heriot-Watt University. Clearly he learned not to release whisky until it is mature. A waxy, grassy nose delights with dry grain, fresh-cut hay, red fruits, and cinnamon hearts. The palate, though less complex shows wheelbarrow loads of sweet fruits, soft spices, earthy notes, and bracing heat. Green grasses, pink clover, and hints of black licorice precede a long, peppery, grassy, floral finish. (Canada only) C$90"
5601,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Egan’s 17 year old Legacy Reserve III Cadillac Cask-Finished, 46%<review>
The golden-sweet wine finish works like a sunbeam from heaven. The nose basks in summer meadow flowers, sweet honey, light citrus, lemon curd, and vanilla. It’s finely structured on the palate, with apricot pastries, runny honey, sugar-coated orange, peach cobbler, candied peel, and the lightest of spices. These Legacy bottlings are pretty special, but this beguiling whiskey is really one to fall for. (1,000 bottles)"
5602,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>G. Rozelieures Origin Collection, 40%<review>Hailing from the Lorraine region, this single malt is double distilled in Charentais pot stills. Orange flesh, lemon sherbet, strawberry bubble gum, candied fruit jellies, grapefruit, and dry spice, with shades of vanilla on the nose. To taste, a wishy-washy orange note with a thin structure hung with milk chocolate, mango juice, papaya, wood spice, and ground ginger, concluding in a pulped-fruit ending."
5603,"<price>33<rating>80<whiskey>High West Silver OMG Pure Rye, 49.3%<review>Barely aged white whiskey. Huge new-make nose, soaked grain and green apple, then rye-driven mint and spice. Bursting spice and mint in the mouth, quick hot fireworks, long gripping finish; somewhat drying. Hot, but holds your attention. Lower distillation proof (134) leaves more room for flavor on this one, and some water makes it enjoyable...if I could just get past that new-make nose I can't help thinking of as “too young.”"
5604,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 2003 14 year old, 54.5%<review>The nose is muted, with gentle orchard fruits, subtle malt, nougat, and nutty toffee. The palate, by contrast, is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes, notably zesty tangerines, along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)"
5605,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Glenlivet Caribbean Reserve, 40%<review>A portion of the whisky that went into the mix was finished in Caribbean rum casks, not the final whisky. The rum barrel finish does shine through. The nose is sweet with cane sugar, tropical fruits, malt, coconut, and banoffee pie. Smooth on the palate, relatively light-bodied, and easygoing, with clear rum notes, fudge, honey, cereal, and developing bitter orange. Cinnamon and oak char in the relatively short finish. Great for mixing."
5606,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Backbone Prime Blended (Batch 4), 52%<review>Think southern kitchen: cornbread, sorghum, and brown sugar. Then it blossoms into a more traditional spice-forward American whiskey, with caramel, vanilla, baking spices, black pepper, habañero, and jalapeño honey. Toward the end, subtle herbs appear just before a long and spicy finish."
5607,"<price>51<rating>83<whiskey>Highland Park Svein, 40%<review>Named after the Viking chieftain whose exploits are central to the Orkneyinga Saga, Svein is the least typically Highland Park of the initial three Warrior releases. The nose is oily, with starch and ozone, then ultimately freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juice. The palate offers a suggestion of smoke, sawdust, and vanilla. Nutty and slightly peppery in the finish, with just a suggestion of peat. €40/liter"
5608,"<price>200<rating>80<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore ‘Comus’ 4.2 2007 5 year old, 61%<review>Comus is the name of a frankly terrifying English folk group who taps into the dark, pagan spirit underpinning that music. An apposite name then for the Laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. If you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln, then sniff this, but the distillery’s sweetness is retained, here in the guise of pineapple and banana. The palate is like eucalyptus lozenges, with light maltiness before that Laddie thickness makes things even sweeter."
5609,"<price>548<rating>88<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 1964 50 year old, 49.1%<review>Rosewater, polished antique oak furniture, nail polish remover, and clove on the nose. It’s fruit forward compared to other aged examples from this closed distillery; the spiced apple and baked plum are partnered by peppery heat and chili, ginger, and fleeting hints of coffee and cocoa. The flavors throb out of this one, producing a long-lasting experience ending with a dry finish of soft fruits and ginger. A splash of water coaxes out nougat and makes the spices behave. (162 bottles) £380"
5610,"<price>12500<rating>93<whiskey>The Dalmore 45 year old, 40%<review>Initially matured in bourbon barrels, then transferred to two Graham’s port colheita pipes from 1961 and 1963. Finally, it was married in first-fill bourbon casks. Wood resin, canola oil, sultanas, and red currants on the nose. Medium-bodied, with sweet resin, honey, and sherry on the palate, turning to treacle and raisins. The finish is very long, with dark chocolate and spicy oak tannins. (500 bottles)"
5611,"<price>200<rating>95<whiskey>Lombard 'Jewels of Scotland' (distilled at Brora), 1982 vintage, 50%<review>Bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. White pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy, salty finish. A vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning, actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!"
5612,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Old Pulteney 17 year old, 46%<review>Pleasingly sweet and fruity, with notes of caramel apples, berries in honey, vanilla, and ripe pear. Fresh brine and subtle mint emerge occasionally and linger on the finish. Nicely balanced, more complex with a wider range of flavors than the Old Pulteney 21 year old. "
5613,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Snake River Stampede 8 year old, 40%<review>They call it cowboy whisky: Smallish bottlers, mostly in the western U.S., buy custom-blended bulk whisky from Canada to release under their own label. This one has enough cachet to find its way back north and into the Canadian market. Sweet and smooth with rich buttery caramels, searing pepper, sizzling ginger, and slatey, dusty rye. Rich dark fruits on the palate turn to zesty citrus notes, then cleansing pith as one sip slowly dissolves into the next. C$25"
5614,"<price>28<rating>82<whiskey>Lovell Bros. Georgia Sour Mash, 47.5%<review>Unaged. Richly sweet with corn, and a bit of new make funk. Replicated very closely on the tongue: alcohol heat, corn sweetness, wild flowers/stems, and faint notes of overripe fruit, with some drying minerality on the finish. Interesting where it’s not clean; a balance of craft and cunning."
5615,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Classic Cask, 13 year old, 1991 Vintage, Batch GL-109, 45.4%<review>A remarkably balanced bourbon. Evolving notes of maple, vanilla, mint, dried fruit, coconut, and polished oak with a hint of leather on the finish. Very clean and drinkable too-especially for a 13 year old bourbon. Only 726 bottles were produced, but it’s worth tracking down one of the remaining bottles. 
"
5616,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1993 Vintage (Barrel #45), 43.3%<review>Amber color. Aroma of soft fruit, sweet corn, caramel, light toffee, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body, and smooth. On the palate, notes of caramel coated fruit, corn and delicate toffee notes, becoming gently dry, with notes of vanilla and mint."
5617,"<price>587<rating>90<whiskey>The Lost Distilleries Blend (Batch Four), 50.9%<review>An enticing blend of aged single malt and grain whiskies from silent stills, top-dressed with Port Ellen. The nose has soft fudge, rosehip, and honey lozenges, with a thread of peat sewn through it. A distinct smokiness hangs above the glass. A mouthful exudes lemon sherbet, honey-drizzled melon, and white chocolate, peaking with raspberry and mixed peel before a conclusion of banana-layered banoffee pie. An elegant finish of baked lemon and sweet oak. One for reflection. £350"
5618,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Mossburn Signature Casks Series Speyside Blended Malt, 46%<review>This is clever. Using Mossburn Cask Bill #2, the whisky has been finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts with heavily toasted virgin American oak heads. The nose is intense: sweet barley, fresh oak, vanilla, pear, fresh apple, orange peel, and dry wood spices. Silky texture, with citrus, barley, coriander seed, pepper, aniseed, and clove, offering further waves of creamy vanilla, fruit Life Savers, and soft malty notes."
5619,"<price>76<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 12 year old Cask Strength 2014 release, 52.3%<review>This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component whisky was matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45"

The nose has expressive peat with mineral and herbal, rather than smoky, characteristics; there’s also orange oil, fresh ginger, and chalk. Water brings out blueberries and blackberries. Nutty and roasted flavors dominate the palate, with mouthwatering oak, black pepper, and coffee bean, sprinkled with orange oil, shoulder to shoulder with the peat. It finishes with savory ashy char: a whisky for the great outdoors. (216 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5621,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>J.J. Corry The Gael (Batch 2), 46%<review>Blended from select stocks by Irish whiskey bonder Louise McGuane, this new batch has a fine combination of aromas of lemon, white flowers, lychee, peach, lime, grapefruit peel, white pepper, sliced cucumber, and cold-pressed olive oil. Initially mouth drawing, it has a medium-weight, silky, buttery texture that explores melon, vanilla, pepper, cream-filled doughnuts, and sweet banana, with lemon and nimble spices on the finish. (3,500 bottles)"
5622,"<price>220<rating>75<whiskey>Knockando 25 year old Special Release 2011, 43%<review>What a contrast with the standard bottling. Here we have Knockando in a hugely active cask and, sadly, its fragile character collapses under the assault. The nose is oily and sulphury with notes of sealing wax, Turkish tobacco, and maraschino. The palate is dry and tannic, the opposite of what is needed for a whisky that is nutty and dusty in the first place."
5623,"<price>24<rating>88<whiskey>Old Forester Straight Rye, 50%<review>Old Forester’s first-ever rye and first new mashbill in 150 years, balanced at 65% rye, 20% malted barley, and 15% corn. Cinnamon, raspberries, blackberry, vanilla, and spiced oak greet the nose. The palate starts out sweet and fruity, then reveals an almond nuttiness, cinnamon, orange, and chili pepper. Water coaxes out ginger, pecan, and more heat. A smooth finish that’s still spicy, ending with a flourish of candied orange and rich chocolate."
5624,"<price>185<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Garioch 1986, 54.6%<review>This latest vintage release from Glen Garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. It follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978, 1990, 1991, and 1994 vintages. Peaches and ginger on the nose, with fudge and a wisp of smoke. Mildly herbal. Full-bodied, rich, and sweet in the mouth. Fresh fruit and violet creams. Finally a slightly earthy, peaty note. The finish is long and gently smoky. Robust, yet refined."
5625,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Old Pepper Finest Kentucky Oak Straight (Batch K02), 58%<review>This whiskey’s lush qualities are immediately evident on the nose, which is redolent of Mexican chocolate, cedar spice, fresh dark berries, raisin-studded stollen, and balsam boughs. Without water, oak dominates the palate, but add a few drops and much more unfolds: grape cough syrup, blackcurrant jam, mocha, and rich spice, with more blackcurrant, allspice, pepper, and lingering herbs on the finish. There’s lots to unpack here, all of it good. Editors' Choice"
5626,"<price>16<rating>79<whiskey>Early Times 354 Bourbon, 40%<review>Sweet corn, along with caramel, vanilla, and more subtle ripe summer fruits (on the nose and palate). Light, slightly brash finish. Rather sweet, somewhat youthful tasting, straight-forward, and unpretentious. Not something I would be drinking neat, but it does fare better on the rocks. (The ice and cold water cut through and calm the sweetness.) I think a little more aging would add some depth, and balance some of the sweetness with more oak spice."
5627,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon, 47.5%<review>A mashbill of 60/20/10/10 corn/wheat/rye/malt, aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Nose is sweet, hot corn, but with an initial puff of sulfur; where’s that from? Interesting splash in the mouth, with smooth wheat character knocking back the rye spice. Fairly hot, with some clove/cinnamon spice amping up as it winds down to the warm finish. Very active whiskey."
5628,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Bowmore 16 year old 1991 Vintage, 53.1%<review>Matured in a port pipe. The third in a trilogy (the other two being bourbon and sherry cask-aged). I like this one better than the sherry cask 1990 vintage, but not quite as much as the bourbon cask bottling which was in our Top Ten whiskies two years ago. Lovely amber ruby color. The port flavors are obvious, but not sappy or dominating. They’re clean, and contribute a layered sweetness and ripe red berry fruit notes to the traditional, moderately peated Bowmore smoke and peat. Lingering smoke and chocolate on the finish. 
"
5629,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition, 46%<review>Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition carries no age statement, though it contains a blend of whisky more than 15 years old and spirit produced since the distillery reopened in 2003. It has been matured in former bourbon barrels. The nose exhibits barley, citrus fruits, pear drops, crystallized ginger, marzipan, and cocoa. Oily in the mouth and slightly earthy, with brazil nuts and developing vanilla fudge and lemon on the palate. Fruitiness persists through the spicy finish. "
5630,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Fusion Series Kentucky Straight Bourbon (No. 2), 49.45%<review>It’s all about the grain with this whiskey, made with two high-rye bourbons and a wheated bourbon. Honey Nut Cheerios, strawberry shortcake, lemon tart, almonds, pistachios, candied ginger, and a touch of coconut cream on the nose. The palate keeps the mashbill in play, with sweetness and warm pastry notes, but showcases the barrel’s best qualities: chocolate, cinnamon, and integrated spice. Consistent into the finish, which is peppery and warm with cinnamon-laced dark chocolate, nuts, and toasted cereals. (30,600 bottles)"
5631,"<price>25<rating>79<whiskey>Glory Irish Poitín, 40%<review>Styled as the Original Moonshine, these aromas whisper of sweet summer fruits, golden barley, and potato farls. There is no lightning bolt of alcohol sipping at 40% ABV, but it is smooth and pleasantly tasty; flavors of melon, apple, and sugared biscuits, finishing with a barley tickle around the gums. A versatile addition to your cocktail armory from West Cork Distillers of Skibbereen, but I found it lost much of its appeal poured over ice."
5632,"<price>46<rating>85<whiskey>New York Distilling Co. Ragtime Rye Applejack Finish, 50%<review>A true fruit bouquet on the nose, with apple, lemon, peach, and apricots, balanced by gentle wood. Very buttery and creamy on the palate, with a panoply of earthy white chocolate, pretty baking spice, and minced apple. A little too much fresh lumber and banana flavor, but well-balanced and intriguing. The applejack cask finish is a nice touch, but the rye could still use more time in the barrel. Empire rye"
5633,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Hyde No. 1 President’s Cask 10 year old, 46%<review>Like an old confectionery shop, with fruit Life Savers, marshmallow, pear drops, coconut oil, and cherry notes. Ideal for those with a sweet tooth, it doles out tangy citrus, lemon peel, strawberry bubble gum, then evens out with a creamier mouthfeel and more red fruits; red currant and cranberry. Tangy and moreish once you weather the sugar rush, concluding with a lengthy finish of ripe fruits after a spicy flare."
5634,"<price>577<rating>93<whiskey>Redbreast Dream Cask 28 year old, 57.5%<review>Cranberry, red apple, candied peel, glacé cherry, red licorice, and black pepper, with
heather honey, florals, and festive spices on the nose. A fruity concoction of cherry lip
balm, cranberry sauce, caramel, peppercorn, and a hint of apple, the fruit sails through
as the spice and sugar fade. Water softens the impact, but widens the flavor spectrum
to embrace plum, orange, walnut, and cranberry. Price per 500 ml. (912 bottles) €490"
5635,"<price>95<rating>80<whiskey>Ardbeg Galileo, 49%<review>Released to celebrate the Ardbeg space mission, this is a mix of 1990 Ardbeg from bourbon and Marsala casks, and it’s the latter which make the running from the start. Earthy, with blackberry and fruitcake, and sooty peatiness in the background. While there’s a medicinal/herbal note with water, the palate has a damp wood edge. Fortified wine can work with peat, but here there’s a clash between distillery character and the Marsala cask. Sadly, a disappointment."
5636,"<price>39<rating>82<whiskey>New Holland Zeppelin Bend, 45%<review>Young malt whisky. A rich but jumbled nose: cocoa, ripe grape, oak, and vanilla tumble and fight for your attention. A nicely rounded lighter whiskey in the mouth, though, and the cocoa cradles malt sweetness quite nicely...until the oak tears up the finish with a blast of hot spice. You almost want to keep sipping continuously to keep the finish from cutting in. Price is per 375ml."
5637,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Caol Ila 12 year old, 43%<review>On the nose, fresh fish wrapped in bacon with a squeeze of lemon, cooked at a beach barbecue. Floral and allspice notes emerge. The palate is lightly oily, medium-peated, meaty, and softly spiced, with pineapple and melon. The finish dries, with more fruit and peppery peat. Balanced and inviting."
5638,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Cadée Straight Rye, 42%<review>Light and delicate characteristics abound. The nose has raspberries and orange peel, along with fresh-cut wood, iced tea, and rose petals. Wood dominates the palate, lifted by gentle spice, rock candy, walnut shell, stewed plums, and grain. The finish is short, with cola, wood, and bread."
5639,"<price>115<rating>82<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Imperial), 23 year old, 1979 vintage, 56.6%<review>Aged in a bourbon cask.

(Bottled exclusively for “Wine on the 9”.)

5640,"<price>155<rating>82<whiskey>Celtic Cask Ceathair, 46%<review>Originating from Cooley distillery, this whiskey spent a decade in a first-fill bourbon cask before a period of extra maturation in a Vinhos Barbeito madeira cask, and the influence is unmistakable on the nose. Additionally, there is vanilla icing, brown bananas, sprigs of wild mint, and a savory note of smoked duck. It’s a soft, buttery experience with honey, mandarin, guava, banana, and light spices. Dry, short, sweet finish but the Madeira tips the balance. (377 bottles) €125"

Old warm leather, rich smoke, developing peaty peach, chocolate-coated toffee, pipe tobacco, and iodine on the powerful nose. Huge peatiness in the mouth, oily, smoky orchard fruits, developing ginger nuts, and sea salt. Warming in the finish, with licorice, gunpowder tea, and ashy peat."
5642,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Skunk Brothers Smoke Jumper, 45%<review>
Licorice, charcoal smoke, cured tobacco, black pepper, pencil eraser, and bicycle tires on the nose—but don’t be put off, those are attractive notes in a whiskey that’s making sooty phenols one of its central selling points. The palate is dry and peppery, with savory notes of mole sauce, roasted nuts, and coffee bean, along with peppermint and dry-roasted spices. It finishes with black pepper, bittersweet chocolate, more roasted nuts, and persistent char."
5643,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection Original Batch Wheat Whiskey 13 year old, 63.7%<review>Heaven Hill’s straight wheat whiskey, Bernheim Original, is a pleasant drink, but I always felt that some extra aging and a higher proof would give it additional richness and complexity to propel it to a higher level. That’s what this new expression accomplishes. Soothing, gentle layers of caramel-coated nuts, vanilla fudge, coconut cream, maple syrup, and marzipan, with a sprinkle of cinnamon and cocoa. So easy to embrace. Nicely done."
5644,"<price>108<rating>90<whiskey>Timorous Beastie 18 year old, 46.8%<review>Peach, meringue, whole apple, runny honey, vanilla, eucalyptus, and spices that are just about to burn in the pan. Lively and fresh Highland whisky flavor proffering sweet honey, cooked apple dusted with icing sugar, lime zest, and a supportive lift of vibrant spices before diffusing into sugary squares of Scottish tablet. Water accentuates the peppermint in the finish and brings out sugary chocolate-mint flavors. One not to miss."
5645,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Maison Benjamin Kuentz (D’un) Verre Printanier Single Malt, 46%<review>Tropical fruits with burnt peaks on lemon meringue pie, but overall, a clean and elegant proposition. The nimble palate is a fabulous clash between peach, vanilla, and candy sherbet sweetness and a deluge of spice. Accomplished and well made, this smart and affable whisky from Lorraine’s G. Rozelieures Distillery has a mouth-saturating finish backed by strident spices. (1,000 bottles)"
5646,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Sagamore Spirit Port Finish Rye, 50.5%<review>Rose petal and grapefruit meet clove-like spice, but it’s the soapy floral sachet and dill notes that distinguish this rye.

The nose offers white wine, sultanas, ginger, and cocoa powder, plus white chocolate and tangerines. The palate is full, with sweet orchard fruits, ginger, and cinnamon, balanced by dry sherry. The finish is medium in length, with black pepper and cocoa. (1,710 bottles)"
5648,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Glendalough Double Barrel, 42%<review>The single grain category gains another brother. This was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels, finished in Spanish oloroso sherry wood before being reduced with Wicklow mountain water. The nose oozes caramel, browned apple, grated nutmeg, black peppercorn, toasted coriander, and clove. A flash of mint is overtaken by a swath of caramel, apple, and pear drops orbiting the muscular spice kick of clove, pepper, and ground chili concentrated on the tongue. Kapow! One to pour blind to Talisker lovers."
5649,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Ardbeg Perpetuum, 47.4%<review>“Ardbeg in Perpetuum” would mean “Ardbeg forever.” It’s made up of a mélange of different casks: American oak, refill, French oak…and others. Intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. The palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn’t an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)"
