5085,"<price>25<rating>80<whiskey>Bastille Blended Whisky, 40%<review>Described as 'French blended hand-crafted whisky hand-made and finished in French Limousin oak,' this is a real weirdo. It's more interesting than many blends and quite likeable, but it tastes less of whisky and more like a thin Southern Comfort, with liqueur-like orange, some menthol, gentle spice, and other aromatics. Hard to believe nothing has been added."
5086,"<price>62<rating>84<whiskey>Wigle Straight Wheat, 50.35%<review>Wigle’s proud to have a full 2 years of age on this organic wheat whiskey. It’s small-barrel dark, but the nose isn’t a ripper: it’s 100 proof hot, but sweet with grain and even light fruity notes (pear and ripe melon). There’s no denying it’s aggressive, especially for a wheat whiskey, but the small-barrel oak blends well with the grain, giving a robust set of flavors: oak, hard candies, grilled fruit. A bit loud, a bit pushy, but endearing."
5087,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Seven Stills Patience Single Pot Still-Style American Whiskey, 59.5%<review>Waxy and fragrant, with citrus oil, tea bag, furniture polish, dried flowers, cooked apple, and malt. At this proof, the palate demands water, which tames its heat to reveal candied rose petal, dried ginger, apple, almond, pistachio, lemon pepper, pine resin, and some ashiness. It finishes waxy, with charred pecans, cigar end, bitter oak, and black pepper. There are some unusual juxtapositions here, but they work. (302 bottles)"
5088,"<price>125<rating>94<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2014, 40%<review>Make way. The nose is dense, oily, and mesmeric. There’s vanilla, sure, but it’s the intense aroma of vanilla pods split and scraped at knifepoint. Woven around it, there’s crème caramel and heavier cinnamon flaring at the margins, softening with dilution, but remaining sweet. The first Midleton to carry master distiller Brian Nation’s name is purposeful and assured, lacking some of the sappiness of the 2013 release. This is less about succession, more an emphatic statement of intent."
5089,"<price>52<rating>77<whiskey>Cascade Peak Oregon Organic Rye (Batch #1), 50.2%<review>This whisky is only 10 months old, made from 85% rye and 15% malted barley. It’s vibrantly spicy (cinnamon, mint, licorice root, nutmeg), fresh, and clean. Bright citrus and peach also entertain. Rich, underlying vanilla notes try to tame the beast, but they’re really no match. Warm, spicy finish. There’s a lot going on here. Yes, it’s youthful, but far more mature than I expected. This whisky is certainly drinkable now (for those who like their rye whiskey young and bold), but I would like to see it develop some more on oak. That’s the only thing missing here. It shows great potential."
5090,"<price>49<rating>80<whiskey>Double Barrel Caol Ila/Tamdhu, 46%<review>The weakest of the Double Barrel trio on offer, this has a slightly spirity nose with a somewhat unpleasant off note, but the taste promises more than the nose delivers. The oily, peaty Caol Ila is seemingly held in check by the Tamdhu on the one hand, while the fresh, zingy, sherbet-like characteristics of Tamdhu are tantalizingly faint. In the end, pepper and peat dominate.€40"
5091,"<price>125<rating>84<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Blair Athol) 22 year old 1989, 50.5%<review>New to Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range is this single cask (#2927), cask strength offering from Perthshire’s Blair Athol distillery. Sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80"
5092,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Benjamin Chapman 7 year old Canadian Whisky, 45%<review>A complex nose, rich in aromas of fresh peaches, wild beach roses, prairie sage, hints of rye spices, and lumber. A sweet, hot, peppery palate bursts with rye spices, high floral tones, gummy bears, then earthy herbal notes, river plants, and some pulling wood tannins Loaded with rye and apple juice. Fades slowly into herbal notes, brown sugar, and a hint of peach pits."
5093,"<price>59<rating>80<whiskey>St. George’s Chapter 6, 3 year old<review>England’s sole whisky distillery (currently, at any rate; anything could and probably will happen) is located in Norfolk, where farmer Andrew Nelstrop started distilling in November 2006. Small batches have been released in ‘Chapters,’ giving whisky lovers teasing glimpses of how the spirit is maturing. Light and delicate — there’s also a peated variant — Nelstrop reckons it will hit its peak in its early teens. I see no reason to dispute him. This chapter is picking up a straw color and has a nose that’s reminiscent of fresh barley, while a little citrus hangs around at the back. Young — think green apple and green grass with milled flour on the tongue — it’s a whistle-clean whisky. £38"
5094,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>The Whistler Calvados Cask-Finished, 43%<review>
The Whistler is emerging as a standout Irish whiskey for the quality of its flavors. After a 15-month finish in Château du Breuil calvados casks, look for aromas of caramel apple clafoutis, pressed cider apples, and layers of honey, vanilla, ground spice, and floral top notes. Green apple, honey, barley, and vanilla ride a tide of peppery spices, leaving light brown sugar, apple cereal bars, and a long, spicy finish. (3,000 bottles for U.S.)"
5095,"<price>800<rating>95<whiskey>Amrut 10 year old Greedy Angels Bourbon Cask-Finished Single Malt (2019 Release), 55%<review>An intense and enthralling whisky on the nose, with honey, brown sugar, and caramel, then molasses, cooked fruit, vanilla, shredded orange peel, chocolate, and baking spices, yet it still retains a barley freshness. This elegantly carries its potent ABV with aplomb, producing a palate of baked orange, dried pineapple, malt, milk chocolate, and a cascade of spice, sugar, caramelized fruits, and toasted oak. Simply incredible. (900 bottles, 300 for U.S.) Collectible"
5096,"<price>200<rating>74<whiskey>Jefferson’s Presidential Select 25 year old, 45.2%<review>Its age certainly shows, with a good dose of leather, tobacco, and barrel char. Sweet notes of caramel, toffee, and candied fruit try to rescue it, but ultimately fails toward the finish, leaving my mouth parched, leathery, and craving a glass of water (or a beer!). A bourbon with individuality, but it pains me to think what this could have been (or once was)."
5097,"<price>6354<rating>95<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 30th Anniversary Pearl Edition, 53.1%<review>A marriage of a single cask of grain from 1981 with a cask of pot still from 1984 to celebrate 30 years of Midleton Very Rare, the job undertaken masterfully by Barry Crockett and Brian Nation. The expressive nose is redolent of polished antique violin, warm gingerbread, the herbal tinges pricked by spices. Delicate honey, rich vanilla, toasty oak, and tendrils of cinnamon segue into a dry, spicy conclusion. La Peregrina of Irish whiskey. Ain’t she a beauty? (117 bottles) €6,000"
5098,"<price>70<rating>78<whiskey>Westland Peated American Single Malt, 46%<review>This young peated malt, aged at least 24 months, has a nice, dry peat smoke nose, backed by honey and oak. On the palate it’s disjointed: the young peat malt argues with the heavy char barrel, a struggle that needs more time to be worked out. Honeyed malt tries to lend support but everything topples in the mid-palate, where things turn dry, spicy, and slightly acidic. A medium finish wraps up a whiskey that simply needs more time."
5099,"<price>500<rating>95<whiskey>Bushmills 28 year old The Rare Casks Cognac Cask (Release No. 1), 46.7%<review>
The cognac-cask finish finesses the intensity and concentration of the lush fruity character of this whisky. A complex interplay of peach, apricot, apple, pineapple, lemon zest, thick-cut marmalade, oak, faint spices, and dried fruit on the nose. A thick velvety mouthfeel of sweet orange, grapefruit, and lime sweeps to a climax of peppercorn and clove, then it abates with dried apricot, papaya, and marzipan-wrapped Battenberg cake. Exceptional! (800 bottles) Collectibles"
5100,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Myths & Legends II, 46%<review>Two parcels of single malt of differing ages from a Speyside distillery were blended to create this expression. The nose yields milk chocolate, fudge, slightly smoky apricot halves in syrup, and clotted cream. Good mouthfeel, with butterscotch, and orange segments dipped in hot chocolate on the palate. The peppery finish features dark chocolate and bitter orange. (4,446 bottles)"
5101,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Cooper’s Legacy Bourbon, 50%<review>Very oaky, with a nose of fresh sawdust, but beneath lurk deep maple sweetness, pralines, and cherry cough drop. The palate is chewy, sweet, and nutty, with pleasing caramel and butterscotch, but is hurt by some peculiar varnish and furniture polish notes. Finishes with cherry, leather, and more oak."
5102,"<price>90<rating>87<whiskey>The Macallan Edition No. 1, 48%<review>People tend to moan about Macallan having lost its mojo. Not here. This is a vatting of different sized American and (mostly) European oak casks, so no surprise that it’s oak-led, but Macallan is a heavy distillate and it needs oak to prosper fully. Here you get rosin, marmalade, green fig jam, and the power of concentrated oils. The palate is powerful and supple, with some clove, ginger, and yet more chocolate. Substantial and well worth checking out."
5103,"<price>38<rating>86<whiskey>Union Horse Reunion Straight Bourbon, 46%<review>Craft skeptics will find this very aligned to mainstream bourbon, with its enticing nose of Peanut Chews candy, gooey caramel, and cocoa powder. The palate pours on sweet cornbread and marzipan, just a touch hot and slightly antiseptic, before the long finish of cherry and sweet vanilla. Lots of good stuff going on here."
5104,"<price>127<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Invergordon) Mocha Moment 1988, 46%<review>A rather moreish grain, and Wemyss certainly nailed the chocolate orange aromas on the nose here. Bright bursts of rich orange and comforting milk chocolate accompany gentle underlying spices, star anise, treacle-drizzled hams, and Godiva mint pearls. The palate is easygoing, with chocolate muffins, condensed milk, dates, and milky Coco Pops. There is oak, but it’s never obtrusive, and of course, cold mocha that fades slowly, until the moment has passed. (240 bottles) £102"
5105,"<price>101<rating>82<whiskey>Master of Malt Darkness! Benrinnes 15 year old PX Cask Finish, 53.5%<review>Another Benrinnes from the UK bottler’s new range, here the finish is more forceful, with masses of raisined sweetness, blueberry syrup, and molasses. The Benrinnes character adds weight and a firm earthy base, but this is more cask driven, slightly grippy, and for all the richness of the PX cask, the end result is a little bitter because of the treacle/molasses note. Fun certainly, but a bit over the top. £60/500 ml"
5106,"<price>35<rating>85<whiskey>Still Waters 1-11 Special Blend, 40%<review>Still Waters blends sourced whiskey with under 9.09% of their own young spirit as top dressing (hence the name; it’s one part in eleven). Sweet cereal, honey, and flowers on the nose, which become much more authoritative in the mouth. Still sweet, but with a firm thump on the tongue, hot thin honey, crushed flower petals, and a lively, welcome heat for 40%. Clean, cereal-honey finish. Could be a bit more robust, but I like it fine as it is. (Ontario exclusive)C$35"
5107,"<price>124<rating>89<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Cacao Geyser (distilled at Bowmore) 1998, 46%<review>Rich amber. A slight agricultural note to start, and although sweet and soft, also a little indistinct. This is a palate whisky, with plenty of integrated smoke, rich fruitcake, and, as its name suggests, plenty of chocolate. It fades quickly when neat. Water, surprisingly, rectifies this: the nose opens to show complex dark depths, while the palate is lengthened and given extra aromatic lift. Rich and rather lovely. £85"
5108,"<price>110<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Hermann J. Wiemer Noble Select Josef Vineyard Riesling Barrel-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Blend No. CH37), 57.11%<review>

A curious character of tart fruit pervades this whiskey with an unusual finishing cask, starting with underripe blackberries on the nose; there’s also citrus, vanilla, jasmine, orange blossom, almonds in the shell, and a scattering of dried herbs. Tart and citric on the palate—lemon juice, underripe berries, Granny Smith apples, red plums—yet a dark richness of coffee bean, bitter chocolate, and oak offer a pleasing juxtaposition. The lengthy finish retains the interplay of tart fruit and richness until the final exhale."
5109,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Proper No. Twelve, 40%<review>Initially, Conor McGregor’s whiskey seems more laborious than notorious, with a rather unremarkable nose of fondant orange and mediocre spices, not helped by the first sip’s wishy-washy fruitiness of diluted orange and fudge, but before you tap out, it gets back on its feet and starts swinging for the fences with a redeeming comeback of gingerbread, clove, pepper, charred oak, and a knockout, gum-tingling buzz of spice."
5110,"<price>13<rating>84<whiskey>MacQueens of Scotland 3 year old, 40%<review>The nose is grassy and light, with some youthful heat, orange blossom, vanilla, coconut, and cedar. A clean palate of lemon, orange, vanilla, banana, and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla. Basic, but well balanced. (Total Wine & More)"
5111,"<price>600<rating>89<whiskey>Cragganmore, 55.7%<review>An inviting and complex nose of honey, orchard fruits, apple blossom, rosewater, and subtle cinnamon. Rich and creamy in the mouth, with initially intensely sweet fruit and spice notes, followed by ginger, toffee, and vanilla. The finish is warming, gently spicy, and medium in length. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling. (4,932 bottles)"
5112,"<price>120<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Garioch Virgin Oak, 48%<review>The Aberdeenshire distillery of Glen Garioch has released its first ever virgin oak-matured expression, which has employed heavily charred American oak barrels. According to master blender Rachel Barrie, “Glen Garioch’s intense flavor means it holds up well in a new fill cask.” Ripe peaches on the nose, spicy oak, vanilla, and more soft, floral notes in time. Malt, milk chocolate, nectarines, nougat, and mild cloves on the palate, while the finish is medium in length, with ginger and lively oak."
5113,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Wild Turkey Wild Turkey 'Tradition' 14 year old, 50.5%<review>Richly textured -- almost chewy -- with toffee, molasses, nougat, date, candy corn, ripe clementine, and raisin, peppered with dusty grain, cocoa powder, moss, Play-Doh, subtle mint, and herbs. Not as crisp or clean on the palate as the Wild Turkey American Spirit 15 year old, released a couple years ago (which I rated a 94), but it is still very good and rather therapeutic in nature. It makes for a nice digestif. This is a different style of Wild Turkey. There’s a good deal of wood influence. I suspect that some will like this a lot, while others might not warm up to it as much. It took a few encounters for me to embrace it."
5114,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Corsair Triple Smoke, 40%<review>Three batches of malt, smoked separately with peat, cherry wood, and beech. The nose is Islay-reminiscent peat, with some beech bacon under it, but the top is all cherry; very rewarding. For all the nose, the mouth is relatively mild; mostly juicy malt up front, then opening to the peat fire in the middle, the beech crowding around the sides, and the cherry floating overtop like a good pipe tobacco. Smooth, smoky finish. Compelling."
5115,"<price>84<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Irish Single Malt 2001, 56.6%<review>Bonfire smoke, sea salt caramel, and plain chocolate, with a dry minerality and a reassuring, dusty garden shed aroma. Chocolate and ripe fruit on the palate, with pears, some tart acidity, candied jellies, then damsons, sultanas, cocoa, and cinnamon. The creamy mouthfeel slides into Bourneville plain chocolate. The peatiness is well integrated, supporting the alignment of flavors: the smoke outlasts the fading chocolate-cinnamon finish. Best neat, as water blunts the precision and enjoyable sharp edges. £67"
5116,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>Ransom The Emerald 1865 American Whiskey (Batch #005), 43.8%<review>Made by Oregon’s Ransom Wine Co. & Distillery, Emerald is an American interpretation of a traditional Irish pot still whiskey. The nose offers charred oak, bitter orange, toasted grain, oatmeal, dried leaves, and cherry bitters. A spicy palate features notes of orange marmalade, milk chocolate, and red apples. Water unlocks flavors of candied melon, fresh oranges, and raspberries. The finish has charred oak, chocolate fudge, coffee, and roasted malt."
5117,"<price>151<rating>89<whiskey>Adelphi 22 year old (distilled at Macallan), 56%<review>Initially, this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. A complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95"
5118,"<price>17<rating>77<whiskey>Canadian Club Reserve 9 year old Triple Aged, 40%<review>The discontinued 10 year old CC Reserve was typical of the hard-rye genre, with vanilla, caramel, ripe fruit, and hot pepper stitched onto a flinty-firm base. This new 9 year old version, though similar, has obvious differences. Pleasing heat rides an initial surge of toffee, dry grain, and dried dark fruit. A soon-to-arrive pithiness on the shortish finish refreshes, but without the familiar steeliness of its antecedent. "
5119,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Bushmills Irish Honey, 35%<review>Malt whiskey and honey flip back and forth in the nose; so precisely balanced my nose doesn’t seem to know what to make of it. Light and a bit frisky in the mouth, and the honey is more a grace note than a strong presence, though it does come in more in the finish. Not overly sweet, not heavy, but it’s hard to see the honey as a real game-changer."
5120,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Spice Tree, 46%<review>The tastiest of their Signature range, this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge, rye bread, and banana interwoven with French oak influences of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger. As the gentle orange, malt, pear, and apple settle down, little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate, leaving an aftermath of spiced malt, coffee cake, milk chocolate, and cocoa. Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold."
5121,"<price>815<rating>88<whiskey>Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Releases 2015), 56.1%<review>The maturation regime of this Clynelish involves first-fill American oak barrels, rejuvenated and refill American oak hogsheads, plus bodega and refill European oak butts. The minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years, and 2,946 bottles are available.  A complex, perfumed nose, with scorched grass, developing vanilla fudge, and freshly-peeled orange. Classic Clynelish waxiness on the palate, with toffee, more orange, peach, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and developing pepper. The lengthy, creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger."
5122,"<price>25<rating>80<whiskey>Delaware Phoenix Bourbon, 50%<review>Hot corn, vanilla, mint, and just a touch of oak spice; this one's been in the barrel under 12 months. Whoo, it's hot, even for 100 proof. All the right parts are here: corn, vanilla, wood, even some mint, and no serious off-flavors, but it's a rough road. Definitely needs some more time in the barrel, but that should do it some good. Gutsy stuff. Price is per 375ml."
5123,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Kilchoman Sauternes Cask Matured, 50%<review>This 2016 release follows similar port and Madeira quarter cask-matured Kilchomans, with sauternes casks being pressed into service this time. The casks in question were sourced from Château d’Yquem and the whisky is 5 years old. Earthy peat, a savory note, vanilla, citrus fruit, and sweet wine on the nose, while the palate offers smoked haddock, tarry rope, and bonfire embers. The finish is relatively long, with fruity peat. (6,000 bottles)"
5124,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Speyburn 15 year old, 46%<review>A mix of American and Spanish oak casks was used to mature this addition to the core range. A big blast of orchard and tropical fruits characterizes the early nose, along with honey, vanilla, and toffee. The palate also majors in fruit, this time principally oranges, plus caramel, cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lots of vanilla. The finish is quite short, with banana and ginger."
5125,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel-Proof Kentucky Straight Rye, 56.1%<review>Complex from the start, with a nose of roasted nuts and dark fruit—blueberry pie, grape jelly—along with bundled herbs, fresh-brewed iced tea, and weathered barn boards. Mint, cinnamon, pepper, concord grape jelly, peanuts, and black tea swirl on the palate, which is full and robust thanks to the absence of chill-filtration. Without water it finishes hot, but the oak, roasted nut, and tiramisu flavors help retain balance. Editors' Choice"
5126,"<price>350<rating>89<whiskey>Inchmoan Vintage 1992, 48.6%<review>A peated malt from Loch Lomond, this vintage expression spent 25 years in refill bourbon barrels. A delicate, mildly smoky nose, with vanilla, gentle spice, black pepper, and a subtle medicinal characteristic. Soft and fruity on the palate, with encroaching earthiness and dry peat smoke. The smoke lingers in the lengthy finish, with vanilla, aniseed, and spicy, slightly tannic oak."
5127,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Luca Mariano Small Batch Straight (Batch #2019-01), 41.5%<review>Contract-distilled and aged in Danville, Ky. and bottled by Danville-based Luca Mariano, the whiskey company owned by entrepreneur Francesco Viola. Oak influence and licorice on the nose lead to a light palate of orange peel, grapefruit, bitter oak, and pepper spice. Water unlocks dark chocolate, toffee, and peppery heat. Melon and orange peel punctuate the finish, with hints of almond and coconut. Barrel-forward and youthful, but with some interesting notes. (20,000 bottles)"
5128,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1996, 52.3%<review>A very immediate, expressive, sweet start, with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits, sweet citrus, and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. All very luscious and calorific. As if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient, the palate lays it on even more thickly, with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. The light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. One for those with a sweet tooth. Recommended.(U.S. only)"
5129,"<price>135<rating>88<whiskey>GlenDronach 1989 vintage, 19 year old, 58.7%<review>The first single cask release of GlenDronach for the U.S. by the new owners, and a nice one at that. Silky in texture, polished, and clean on the palate, with light toffee, treacle, cherry bonbon, orange-soaked date nut cake, and chocolate-covered raisin. Never cloying, like some heavily-sherried whiskies can be. Silky, soothing finish. Surprisingly soft and youthful for its age. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
5130,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Teeling Blackpitts (Batch 1), 46%<review>
This commendable Irish peated malt has a nose of apple, clove, bonfire smoke, pepper, thick butterscotch sauce, panna cotta, and sweet floral notes. The smoke settles down to a glowing log fire, with a fine layer of spice and a twist of citrus peel oils. Sauternes influence cultivates an exemplary combination of sweetness and spice, yielding a mouth-drenching combination of red apple, tangy orange marmalade, peppery spices, and brown sugar. (6,000 bottles for U.S.)"
5131,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Congenial Spirits Twelve Five Rye, 45%<review>The nose features strong rye spice accompanied by sharp, young oak along with black pepper, graphite, and a touch of green apple. The entry is much heavier and sweeter than you’d expect from such a young whiskey. Things quickly change in the mid-palate with a spice blast of cinnamon, black pepper, rye, and oak. A solid dash of heat gives the mid-palate some kick and drives a short, dry finish. Some nice ideas hampered by the reality of youth."
5132,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Maker’s Mark Wood Finishing Series: Stave Profile RC6 Kentucky Straight Bourbon (2019 Release), 54.1%<review>An impressive nose of cedar cigar box, sweet cornbread crusts, leathery oak, and sweeping vanilla introduce this decadent whiskey. On the palate, the prolific oak offers lots of tobacco, dark chocolate, and sassafras draped over sweet dark berries and coupled with bold baking spices. Coffee, charred oak, and more bitter chocolate linger long on the finish. Water serves well to tame the heat. Finished with the addition of ten toasted RC6-profile staves in the barrel."
5133,"<price>39<rating>85<whiskey>Town Branch Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Uncommonly delicate and floral: a bundle of honeysuckle and grandma’s potpourri on the nose, mingled with cantaloupe, almond milk, rice pudding, peach, and Nilla Wafer. It fills the mouth with an oily texture and flavors of tropical fruit, peach, melon, hazelnut, and citrus soap, finishing with lingering tobacco and nuts. Town Branch uses the same proprietary yeast for this bourbon as its Pearse Irish whiskey, which may explain the unusual flavor profile."
5134,"<price>179<rating>93<whiskey>Jameson Bow Street 18 year old (Batch 2), 55.1%<review>Finished in fresh bourbon casks at Bow St. Distillery, Dublin, this batch has a greater intensity than the first. Baked lemon, vanilla toffee, ground ginger, and snuff. Warm and fruity, with sweet toffee notes, the ginger root leads a high-intensity spice assault, though the reassuring indulgence of the rich toffee never deserts you. Dried banana, herbal notes, and lemongrass outline the finish."
5135,"<price>30<rating>92<whiskey>Knob Creek 9 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Candied cherries and oranges on the nose, along with a note of fresh blueberry and a blast of cinnamon. Smooth on the front palate, with flavors of cinnamon gum, cooked dark berries, old leather, and dunnage warehouse floor. Water brings out chocolate and vanilla, as well as dark fruits and white pepper. A lengthy finish offers savory herbs, bitter chocolate, fresh coffee beans, and roasted walnuts. Great texture and well-balanced throughout."

Medium sherry, orange marmalade, cinnamon, and developing sea salt on the nose. The palate yields more sherry, earthy peat, dark chocolate, honey, and ginger. Fruit spice, sultanas, and charcuterie in the medium to long finish. The best Loch Gorm to date. (15,000 bottles)"
5137,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Frosty Four Wood, 45.2%<review>Think the holidays: nutmeg, butterscotch, cinnamon, gingerbread cookies, and saltwater taffy. Mouth-coating sensations down the jawline and palate roof. Caramel and vanilla follow it home to the finish, where out-of-nowhere black currant and blackberry jam linger to the very end. This is a fun sipper for those who love the barrel-finished style. (375 ml.)"
5138,"<price>17<rating>84<whiskey>Lombard Gold Label, 40%<review>Good weight to this blend. Creamy and mouth-coating on the palate, with a nice malty, honey-tinged backbone. Bright fruitabounds, with golden raisin, lemon meringue, peach, and a hint of pineapple. Notes of creamy vanilla and gently nutty, through to its soft finish. 
"
5139,"<price>32<rating>87<whiskey>Tomintoul Tlàth, 40%<review>Tlàth is Gaelic for “mellow” or “gentle.” Rich malt, caramel, and milk chocolate on the initial nose, with developing ginger, honey, and red apples. Fresh and approachable on the palate, with more chocolate and ginger, plus aniseed, wood spices, and light pepperiness. The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee, more aniseed, and citrus fruits."
5140,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Garioch Cask #992 14 year old 1998, 54.6%<review>Quite fragrant, with a thick, oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla, sticky toffee), ripe barley, earthy peat, licorice root, and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive) "

With the influence of sauternes casks, this great value whisky develops a lovely richness with a nose of dates, strawberry, raspberry, passion fruit, dried apricot, hard candy, and mandarin segments in Jell-O. This barrels through flavors of dark orange, mandarin, coffee, after-dinner chocolates, cocoa, black cherry, and bramble, and leaves behind a slow burn with flashes of mint and chocolate."
5142,"<price>63<rating>88<whiskey>Berrys’ Islay Reserve, 46%<review>Gentle peat smoke mixed with smoldering wood shavings, fresh maritime characteristics, and milk chocolate, but leave the glass a while, and when you return, the smoky intensity gets really pumped. Light melon flavors become engulfed by smoke, then the pepper, ginger, and chili kick in, leaving the soft fruit and vanilla cowering lamb-like in a corner. If you have peat smoke running in your veins, you will love this."
5143,"<price>80<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 45%<review>A benchmark rye whiskey, which has been stored in stainless steel tanks the past several years to prevent excessive aging while new batches mature. This is the last of the “tanked” stock. Soft and teasing for a rye whiskey, but perfectly balanced. Gentle toffee and molasses provide a foundation for interwoven clove, mint, and cinnamon. Delicately dry, lingering finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
5144,"<price>81<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Chocolate Honeycomb (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2001, 46%<review>Rich and malty and, though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label, there is
chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting
on top. Bold and rich, with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and
a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous, with nougat,
macadamia, and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts.
Neat, it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53"
5145,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Virginia Highland Malt Whisky, 46%<review>Malt whisky from the Scottish Highlands finished in Virginia, in Virginia wine casks. A potpourri of red fruit (raspberry, currant, cherry), tangerine, caramel, honey, and marzipan. Polished leather, tobacco, and oak on the finish. The port influence smooths out the rough edges nicely and adds depth to this youthful, lively whisky. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
5146,"<price>86<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Garioch Vintage 1995, 55.3%<review>One of two new Glen Garioch vintages to be produced under the auspices of Morrison Bowmore Distillers’ master blender Rachel Barrie, this 1995 offering is due to appear in the U.S. next year. 1,000 cases are available and maturation has taken place in first-fill bourbon casks. Spice, vanilla, pears, honey, and very discreet smoke on the nose. Hazelnuts, baked bananas, apple strudel, and lots of spice on the sweet creamy palate, backed up by a gentle note of lingering char. £55"
5147,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Benromach Triple Distilled 2009, 50%<review>Benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger, with the characteristic Benromach peat smoke dialed back. The finish embraces insistent black pepper, nutmeg, and very mild peat. £45"
5148,"<price>140<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Longmorn) 30 year old, 40%<review>Amber color. Rich, malty aroma with notes of vanilla, honey, oak, and floral undertones. Thick, mouth-coating texture. Flavors are big and malty, with notes of honey and vanilla up front, then becoming rather dry with oak and subtle citrus. Huge, long dry finish. 
"
5149,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Balblair 1991 Crozes-Hermitage Finish, 45%<review>Distilled in October 1991, this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage, the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants, sultanas, vanilla, and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet, with summer fruits, but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2,000 bottles."
5150,"<price>46<rating>92<whiskey>George Dickel Barrel Select, 43%<review>The star of the portfolio. A true sipping whisky with elegance and grace. Perhaps the best Tennessee whisky on the market. Honey-soaked corn bread, rhum agricole, ripe nectarine, and glazed citrus. Hint of mint, green tea, and cinnamon. Very polished.   "
5151,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 12 year old, 40%<review>When in doubt, the answer to any question is usually ‘more whisky.’ Here, peat smoke takes an upper hand over the sweet aromas of juicy orange and pear. The whisky begins icing-sugar sweet, settles to bubble gum, pear, apple, and malt, showing its impeccably balanced, finely textured character replete with strands of oak spices, gentle smoke, baked pastry, and vanilla custard. You can’t go wrong at this price."
5152,"<price>1052<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1974 (Cask #8579), 57.2%<review>Although from a refill, the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. Some nose burn, with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. Here’s Glenfarclas in a darker guise, with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts, lamb and mint sauce. The palate is big, thick, and sweet with lots of extract, but also Turkish delight, sultana, and prune. While sherried, it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced, the sweetness massive. £625"
5153,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Chattanooga 111 Proof Straight Bourbon (Batch 19J03E), 55.5%<review>Grainy on the nose, with butterscotch haystacks, strawberry lollipop, sugared pineapple, mango, dried kiwi, and grape soda. Without water, the palate is crowded with oak, peppery heat, and cocoa; add a bit, however, and there’s room for sweet plums and cherries, grape jelly, butterscotch, and chai spices, finishing with dry oak, peanuts, licorice, and tobacco. Made with the distillery’s signature “Tennessee high malt” mashbill, which includes corn, malted rye, and two types of malted barley."
5154,"<price>390<rating>90<whiskey>Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 40 year old, 55.4%<review>This is an amazing link back to Glasgow in the 1970s. Fresh peach, cherry blossom, red Tunes, baked apple, hay bales, acetone, orange peel, and old pepper grinders. A silky texture with red apple, orange oils, and a luxuriantly refined taste leads to apple peelings, caramel, and ginger. Such quality! The finish slips away quietly: melon, peach, fudge, and a final twist of pepper. Bliss! Great to see Douglas Laing bringing out more XOP single grains of such standing. (150 bottles)"
5155,"<price>130<rating>90<whiskey>Kilbeggan 18 year old, 40%<review>Kilbeggan, once overshadowed by its stable-mates, is the rising star in the Cooley repertoire; an active distillery once more and capable of thoroughbred gems like this. This isn’t your typical Irish whiskey at all, so be warned. Sure there are lashings of soft caramel, peach crumble, and vanilla up front, but then the wood takes over and big waves of tannin and chili pepper kick in. It’s 40% ABV but it delivers a much harder punch. Limited edition release."
5156,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin Legacy, 43%<review>Tomatin Legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks, and after an initial release in Europe, worldwide availability will follow. Honey and malt on the nose, melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. White pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. Fresh and lively on the sweet, fruity palate, with tinned pineapple, cake mix, and more pepper. Quite dry in the medium length finish, with a suggestion of chili. £26"
5157,"<price>110<rating>90<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 22 year old, 45.2%<review>Delightful opening of fruit, praline, caramel, maraschino cherries, and spice, with a burst of smoked paprika and a hint of leather. It’s soft on the palate, easily gliding down the jawline, filling with flavors of caramel chew, saltwater taffy, coffee, and a rich, toasted pumpernickel rye with just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Based on the taste, I’d think this flavorful beauty would offer a long finish, but misses the mark. Thankfully, spice over the medium finish is quite pleasant."
5158,"<price>59<rating>82<whiskey>Inchgower 14 year old, 43%<review>You could argue that there’s an element of auto-suggestion at work when you pick up saltiness in Inchgower, after all, it comes from a fishing port (Buckie). But taste it blind and there it is — an unmistakable salinity on nose and palate which, when combined with lemon accents, cumin seed, thin fruit syrups, and green grapes, makes this an intense, perfect, aperitif. £37 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5159,"<price>451<rating>87<whiskey>Glencadam 30 year old, 46%<review>This is a single cask (#729) bottling, distilled in 1982, and the outturn was just 260 bottles. Soft and supple on the waxy nose, with worn leather, Jaffa oranges, and malt. Lots of leather, with brittle toffee, orange creams, and a slightly musty note on the full palate. Mouth-drying in the lengthy finish, but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280"
5160,"<price>150<rating>87<whiskey>Cream of Kentucky 11 year old Straight, 51%<review>The dried fruit, almost like Fruit Roll-Ups, quickly veers toward circus peanuts candy, taffy, and bubble gum, with notes of herbs— especially dill. The palate remains a bit of a fruit bomb, with banana, peach puree, dried papaya, and other tropical fruits, then clove and allspice add some complexity. A flavorful, if slightly peculiar bourbon dominated by tutti-frutti flavors and dill."
5161,"<price>42<rating>88<whiskey>Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Islay Blended Malt, 44.2%<review>One of four new affordable blended malts in the range, this delivers a direct line of clean, pure smoke; richly peaty, with shrimp shells, salty sea spray, fresh citrus peel, vanilla, and the aroma of fine cigar smoke. There’s an elegant purity to the nose. The palate takes a different course, with tangy, sharp citrus, bitter orange, herbal notes, lemon sherbet, shortbread, and jagged spices. Quite a stallion. £32"
5162,"<price>24<rating>80<whiskey>Palmetto Moonshine Corn Whiskey, 52.5%<review>Mason jar packaging makes for an awkward pour; had to be said. Nose is hot, with a fruity sweetness and fainter notes of grassy green corn, flowers, and rock. Clean and sweet, with more corn character here, along with other fresh grains. Not nasty, not bad, but seems to be mostly aimed as a base for Palmetto’s apple pie and peach flavors. Otherwise…it’s sweet, corn-tinged vodka."
5163,"<price>53<rating>86<whiskey>Michter’s Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon (Batch 15H664), 45.7%<review>Smells like bourbon—corn, a bit of cinnamon, oak—but there’s something else: a touch of doughy sweetness, a note of straight wood, a twist. Light and pleasant, with enough heat to keep it respectable (and likely alive in a cocktail); all the usual suspects are here, but without the heavier oak character. Afternoon bourbon."
5164,"<price>110<rating>90<whiskey>Connemara, 12 year old, 40%<review>One of Cooley’s finest efforts. Moderate doses of kiln smoke, dried turf, and kippers, tamed by vanilla cream, barley, and a buttery, olive oil texture. Subtle spices dance on the palate. Lingering smoky, white pepper finish. Islay meets Ireland. 
"
5165,"<price>359<rating>91<whiskey>Tomintoul Five Decades, 50%<review>The soft fruit theme continues in this vatting of whiskies from, you guessed it, five decades of the distillery’s life. This has a heavy, heady, honey element alongside apple blossom and then peach and apricot pulp. There’s real complexity. The palate is lighter, although still layered with some heat. With water there’s more apricot skin and some banana. Don’t overwater, as it becomes a touch too tannic. You want that unctuous elegance. Highly recommended. £250"
5166,"<price>1100<rating>91<whiskey>Bruichladdich 1986, 44.6%<review>This expression was distilled in December 1986 and filled into seven oloroso sherry butts. In 2012 the whisky was transferred to Pedro Ximénez butts for finishing. The nose yields sultanas, figs, old leather, and white pepper. Very sweet fruit notes on the palate, almost sugary, with background rich sherry, dates, and treacle. Long and warming in the finish, with a wisp of smoke and fruit spices. (4,200 bottles)"
5167,"<price>39<rating>87<whiskey>Belle Meade, 45.2%<review>This one’s calling to me; I can smell the rich nose from a foot away. Freshly-sieved cornmeal, sharp oak aromas, and spice cake in the nose. Good body, a bit warm (expected from the proof), and a mouthful of
cracked corn, piecrust, sun-warmed meadow-mint, and vanilla. Finish is firm and leaner than the mouth, drawn out nicely. Belle Meade is currently sourced from MGP; Green Brier hopes to have their distillery up this year."
5168,"<price>16<rating>80<whiskey>Jim Beam White Label, 40%<review>Grain in several forms begin this experience. First it’s raw corn kernels, freshly buttered popcorn, boiled oats, rye toast, and cornbread. Then oak, raisins, and slight hints of vanilla develop, but the concentrated cornbread dominates after its appearance. However, though at a low proof, water is needed to cut the heat. Recommended with ice, water, and/or cola."
5169,"<price>500<rating>92<whiskey>WhistlePig The Boss Hog VI: The Samurai Scientist Umeshu Barrel-Finished Rye (Barrel 8), 60.3%<review>Made using koji during fermentation and finished in barrels seasoned with umeshu, a plum liqueur. Earthy and a bit mysterious, with sandalwood incense, cedar smoke, eucalyptus, barrel char, and sweet aromas of vanilla taffy, key lime pie, and lemon oil. There’s a lot of dry oak on the palate, but it’s balanced with chewy herbs, lapsang souchong tea, pistachio, orange peel, milk chocolate, fennel, and peppery spice. The finish is long, spiced, and herbal, with licorice, mint, eucalyptus, and dry oak. Collectible"
5170,"<price>131<rating>87<whiskey>Reisetbauer 12 year old, 48%<review>Peppermint cream, menthol, whole plum, cranberry, and very delicate toasted-wood spices. The palate has cooked apple, Fruit Pastilles, plum flesh, malt, drinking chocolate, and brown sugar. As time progresses, it develops a slight sourness, with the spices spreading out wide under the tongue. The final phase conjures up a char note, black tea, and burnt sultana bread, leading to a finish of spices and dulled stewed fruit."
5171,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>GlenDronach 15 year old Revival, 46%<review>GlenDronach 15 year old Revival went on hiatus three years ago due to a shortage. In 2018 it re-emerged with a new recipe, tweaked by master distiller Rachel Barrie. As before, a mixture of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks has taken care of the aging process, and the result is one of the very best sherried single malts of its age on the market. The distillery’s characteristic spice, fruit, and chocolate notes are here in abundance, merging seamlessly and with satisfying complexity to create a great after-dinner dram. Number 8 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
5172,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Oban, 18 year old, 43%<review>Drier, less toffee and fruit, more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard Oban 14 year old.  A beautiful combination of rich, nutty toffee balanced by polished oak, salt, pepper, seaweed, distant smoke, and dried fruit.  Somewhat oily in texture.  Wonderful depth, too!  An improvement on what is already the biggest-selling Diageo single malt scotch in the U.S.  Very exciting and dynamic.  (7,700 bottles available only in the U.S. and at the Oban distillery).
"
5173,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Port Charlotte PC7, 61%<review>Aged in a combination of sherry and bourbon oak. Bold and fresh, bursting with testosterone. Notes of damp kiln smoke, tar, wet sheep, roasted chestnuts, and pine forest bedding, along with more subtle pear, espresso, anise, and brine. Sweet notes of vanilla, fig cake, and maple syrup serve up balance and complexity. Appetizing brine and tar finish. It’s more mature than last year’s PC6. Earthier and less fruity, too! Plus, I feel that the sherry notes in PC7 integrate better than the Madeira notes from PC6. But my favorite is still the original PC5 for its purity, balance, maturity (for its age), and pristine character. (I lined up all three yesterday and tasted them side-by-side.)"
5174,"<price>11<rating>79<whiskey>James Foxe, 40%<review>The lush, weighty mouthfeel of this affordable mixing whisky surprises, as does the gently complex parade of ripe red cherries and plums, Weetabix cereal, dry green hay, pencil shavings, and blistering ginger root. There’s a lot of whisky here, though it’s light and subtle. What burns in the mouth is slippery smooth in the throat, ending in classic Canadian bitter grapefruit pith. Tasting suggestion: add ginger ale. A pleasing citron residue lingers in the empty glass."
5175,"<price>170<rating>88<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Octave The Huntly 1996 21 year old, 52.7%<review>Lush, soft summer fruits bathe the nose with green melon, kiwi, green apple, tart gooseberry, ladyfingers, and a not unpleasant plastic note, like toy building blocks or the glove compartment of a new car. Baked orange delivers sharp tart flavors, with allspice, barley sugar, and hard candies, later developing apple notes and settling into a creamy, fruity finish."
5176,"<price>118<rating>90<whiskey>Bowmore 15 year old Laimrig, 53.7%<review>This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (Whisky Shop chain only) £70"
5177,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Balblair 1999 (2nd release), 46%<review>This Balblair vintage replaced the previous 1997 bottling, and maturation took place in a mix of bourbon barrels and sherry butts. The nose offers milk chocolate, candied ginger, caramel, honey, and musty oranges. Relatively dark fruits on the palate, with licorice, honey, and vanilla. A medium to long finish, spicy, with slight oakiness."
5178,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Bruichladdich 'Peat', 46%<review>The most heavily peated of the three (35ppm phenol), but rather gentle for such smoke intensity. No doubt this is partly due to its sweet underbelly of vanilla cream puff, honeyed barley, and melon fruit. The other factor is that the smoke influence is not medicinal like some other Islay whiskies, but rather more of a leafy bonfire smoke, with burning embers and teasing brine on the finish. Like Waves, Peat comes across as a bit youthful."
5179,"<price>111<rating>85<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2012), 56.1%<review>This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect."
5180,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Redemption Wheated Bourbon, 48%<review>Chocolate, vanilla cream fried pie, and herbs offer insight into this opening round of a fabulous whiskey. Cornbread, pecan pie, roasted walnuts, and chocolate-flavored coffee hit mid-palate, followed by cinnamon roll, pumpkin spice, and mint. But the finish falls slightly short, only offering a hint of caramel."
5181,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Balcones Texas Bock Straight Malt Whiskey, 50%<review>Balcones has partnered with fellow Texan Spoetzl Brewery in the past, supplying barrels for the Shiner bock and märzen-style beers. This is its first whiskey distilled from Spoetzl beer. Its dark hue hints at an earthy, malty profile, and the nose delivers rich malt, spice, dried fruit, dried leaves, and oak. Rustic on the palate, with caramel and oak char. More malt on the finish, with water bringing out some sweetness. (6,000 bottles)"
5182,"<price>49<rating>85<whiskey>Whiskey Del Bac Classic Unsmoked, 42%<review>Driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose, this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness, with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack. On the palate, the cherry and red berry fruit meet some pleasant peppery and clove spice, with the impression of lemon oil. Pleasingly drinkable, with caramel and more oak on the modest finish."
5183,"<price>125<rating>79<whiskey>Tomatin, 25 year old, 43%<review>Plenty of citrus zest, along with subtle pineapple and coconut on the nose. The palate begins with honeyed-malt sweetness, followed by the citrus fruit, but then quickly turns dry and resinous, with dried nuts and spicy oak on the finish. The intensity of the dryness on the finish surprised me and detracted from an otherwise well-rounded dram. 
"
5184,"<price>750<rating>93<whiskey>GlenDronach Grandeur 24 year old (Batch 9), 48.7%<review>A triumphant expression including whisky distilled in 1990, 1992, and 1993 and matured in Spanish oak sherry butts. The nose offers creamy sweet sherry, figs, a hint of black treacle, cinnamon, and ripe cherries. The full palate yields sultanas, tangy citrus fruit, sweet oak, roasted chestnuts, and ginger. Lingering bright fruit notes in the finish, with raisins, plain chocolate, and cigar boxes. (1,487 bottles)"
5185,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Kavalan Distillery Select, 43%<review>With two distilleries now on-site, the new Kavalan has a nose of apple and cinnamon pie, loaves of bread, new hardback books, flashes of lemon peel, and mild spices that flatter the baked fruits. A lighter structure, with pleasant green apple and pear notes, a tingle of pepper and allspice, becoming creamier with the flavor of sherbet flying-saucer candy. More active spices on the finish amid fading fruits."
5186,"<price>10<rating>79<whiskey>Rich & Rare, 40%<review>Very sweet butterscotch, sultanas, and smatterings of oak play off lime juice, sweet and sour sauce, and pulling citrus pith in a spirity but quintessentially smooth whisky. Creamy caramel shows hints of fudge that softens the crispness of freshly split red cedar shakes. Simple and tightly integrated. A sintering peppery heat quickly dominates the palate even as overripe fruits emerge in a finish that moves single-mindedly into a classic citric zest. A frisky mixer that is well worth sipping."
5187,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey> Eagle Rare 17 year old (2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 45%<review>At first it’s a confectionery delight, with notes of cotton candy, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and praline. Then a spice explosion hits as the caramel becomes more defined. We’re talking pumpkin pie spice with hints of allspice, cardamom, and clove. Tobacco and stone fruit develop toward the end. Alas, its medium finish, with a hint of oak, doesn’t continue the complexity found on the palate."
5188,"<price>350<rating>91<whiskey>Hammerhead 28 year old Czech Single Malt, 51.2%<review>Floral, resinous, almost hoppy on the nose, with dusty cedar chest, old leather chair, white pepper, licorice, and an intriguing tangy note, like pickles. The palate’s intense oakiness is tempered by an herbaceous sweetness and integrated spice—cinnamon, cubeb, and allspice, with chalky minerality. There’s a savory and saline quality that lingers into the finish, which is spicy and dry with oak tannins. Distilled in 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia, using Czech peat, and matured in Czech oak casks. (300 bottles; U.S. only)"
5189,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>G. Rozelieures Peaty Collection, 46%<review>A little savory at first, with burning leaves and green wood, aromatic spice mix, pastrami, malt loaf, and Worcestershire sauce. Certainly complex and distinctive from a sensory perspective. Initially there is light vanilla sponge, citrus, and brown sugar, but the vanilla grows stronger, combines with malt, and meets an angry surge of pepper. The pepper kicks back to peat smoke and then all is right with the world."
5190,"<price>160<rating>91<whiskey>Bowmore 25 year old, 43%<review>Amber chestnut color. Aromas of rich sherry, ripe fruit, toffee, molasses, peat smoke, damp oak, and nuts. Medium to full in body. Its flavors start out rich and sweet, with sherried fruit, toffee, and dark chocolate. It then becomes drier with notes of peat, smoked nuts, seaweed and brine, ultimately finishing with notes of spice, bitter chocolate, and smoky smoldering embers. This is a new bottling of Bowmore 25 year old and an improved one at that. It is richer, fuller, and more balanced than its predecessor. A wonderful dram indeed. The 17 year old was my favorite of the standard Bowmore line. Not anymore."
5191,"<price>71<rating>86<whiskey>Mackmyra Sommartid, 46.1%<review>Be more Swedish: escape the city and head to a rural, red-painted summer house with a tasty bottle of this little beauty tucked under your arm. A clean, fresh nose of marshmallows, Scottish tablet, warm spices, and reed matting. A thick, substantial palate with an array of lighter flavors; sweet barley sugar, honey, melon, vanilla frosting, gentle citrus, and spicy cinnamon. Great balance of power and delicacy here. The cinnamon rolls into a finish that really goes the distance. €65"
5192,"<price>53<rating>90<whiskey>Blue Note 9 year old Straight Bourbon, 46.5%<review>A kind of luscious sweetness appears up front, as pecan pie, glazed banana chips, dried pineapple, dates, and green apple candies meet gentle spice. The maturity is really lovely, with sweet waxy notes of honeycomb, and a palate that smacks of chewy nougat, milk chocolate, and toasted nuts, ending with cinnamon and peppercorn spice; the oak is perfectly restrained. (4,000 bottles)"
5193,"<price>122<rating>80<whiskey>Port Askaig, 19 year old Cask Strength, 50.4%<review>As with the 30 year old, here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive. There’s not a lot of cask at work here—this has real minerality, and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip. Halfway in a fire ignites, sending clouds of smoke forward, but then it dries too quickly. Good, but just not enough oak to give it depth and length. £80"
5194,"<price>40<rating>77<whiskey>Koval Rye Chicago, 40%<review>Smelling the rye from a foot away after pouring. Exceptionally clean aroma of grain; the oily/spicy rye notes come through clearly. Quite smooth. Not a lot of flavors: very focused on the rye itself, with grain and just a touch of mint. A long finish with sweet grain that slowly turns to mint in the end. "
5195,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates Revolution Brewing, 40%<review>Fresh, clean floral scents, light honey, golden syrup, and a hoppy edge hail this latest collaboration created by finishing Jameson whiskey in barrels seasoned with Chicago-based Revolution Brewing’s Fist City pale ale. The taste begins with fresh hoppy notes, slightly herbal, with gentle spices and an active pepperiness that grows larger in the headlights. The long spicy aftertaste follows the vestiges of the creamy nougat, vanilla, and green apple flavors."
5196,"<price>500<rating>88<whiskey>Lagavulin 30 year old, 52.6%<review>An elder Lagavulin. Thirty years of oak aging has mellowed this whisky. Fragrant and floral, with suggestions of perfumed soap. Spicy too, with cinnamon and anise. Classic leafy, smoky notes, along with some tarry rope, emerge on the palate and maintain a steady keel as they work their way through an ocean of vanilla malt. Lingering finish of burning embers. Certainly an enjoyable Lagavulin, but I still like the standard 16 year old better. It’s hard to improve on a classic."
5197,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Montgomerie's Single Cask #910 (distilled at Benrinnes) 1989 Vintage, 59.1% ABV<review>(Exclusive to Park Ave Liquors, New York, NY) A rich, clean, bright whisky, with aromas of honey, marshmallow, vanilla, and a mélange of fruit (orange, peaches, lemon, pineapple). Creamy in texture and richly flavored without being heavy or cloying. The various fruit notes dance on the palate and add complexity to the sweetness. Long, soothing finish. Great after dinner-given its considerable weight, but lively enough to have before dinner.

5198,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Oban Little Bay, 43%<review>Finally, an unimpeachable counterpoint to the rally cry against no age statement whisky. Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is, and more. A rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. On the palate, Little Bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. A long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky."
5199,"<price>45<rating>80<whiskey>Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Apple Wood, 45%<review>Juicy Fruit gum, Kool-Aid, sugared orange gumdrops, and candied papaya and mango meet fresh-cut lumber on the nose. The palate has notes of bruised banana and juicy guava, with assertive wood and cocoa powder to balance the sweetness.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies, but usually around 3 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using apple wood pieces."
5200,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>Westland Garryana Single Malt 2|1 (2017 edition), 50%<review>Aromas of woodsmoke with hints of hot tar and rubber are draped over ripe berry fruit. Dark and somewhat brash, it comes off a touch hot, fully revealing its 100 proof, becoming more fruit driven on the palate, as sweet berry, buckwheat honey, and sorghum syrup give way to smoldering baking spice on the drying, oak-laced finish. More muscle than finesse, however the 21% Quercus garryana is revealing itself more in this second iteration."
5201,"<price>140<rating>89<whiskey> Exclusive Malts 2002 (distilled at Miltonduff) 14 year old, 54.1%<review>The initial nose is herbaceous, with green apples, then brittle toffee. Developing Juicy Fruit gum flavors. The palate is straightforward, but full and pleasing, featuring pineapple, fudge, vanilla, and almonds. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with a hint of black pepper. (Cask no. 263; 176 bottles)"
5202,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Bushmills 21 year old Madeira Finish, 40%<review>Deep amber color. Richly flavored aroma, with notes of toffee, raisins, dates, honeyed malt, and demerara rum. Medium in body and richly textured. Toffee & rum-like flavors entertain the palate first, followed by chocolate covered raisins and dates. The whiskey then begins to dry out mid-palate, as the 21 years in oak becomes evident, contributing notes of vanilla and subtle mint. Dry finish with lingering notes of oak and polished leather. This is a delicious whiskey that should appeal to both the Irish and Scotch whisk(e)y drinker. Aged initially in sherry and bourbon casks, the whiskey was then finished in Madeira casks. It is complex in flavor and very well balanced. It is one of the best Irish whiskeys on the market. This whiskey has been a long time comin', but it was worth the wait."
5203,"<price>420<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) cask #7020 39 year old, 40.5%<review>There have been several lovely older expressions of Bunnahabhain over the past decade, and this is one of them. The vanilla cream and toffee nuttiness is balanced perfectly by polished oak, bright fruit (apricot, sultana, cherry pits), and subtle anise. There’s a calming quality to this whisky that is very more-ish. All the maturity of an older whisky without the tired, dominating oak."
5204,"<price>3108<rating>96<whiskey>The Last Drop (distilled at Lochside) 1972 (Cask No. 346), 44%<review>A remarkable beauty from the Angus town of Montrose. The elegant nose shows a dram at peace with itself; golden syrup, hay bales, ground hazelnut, liquid honey, French baguette, High Mountain oolong, and rubbed spice blends. Refreshing palate of honey, toffee, citrus, honeycomb wax, and a profusion of sweet vanilla. Rich, sweet oak and deep pepper notes to finish. Truly a sublime and venerable grain. (106 bottles) £2,400"
5205,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Whiskey Del Bac Winter Release 2017, 50%<review>An intriguing nose of campfire smoke drapes the distinctive aroma of mesquite charcoal, dark toast with honey, and pretty floral notes. On the palate, the blast of initial sweetness gets swept up in burnt matchsticks, peppery heat, and wood tannins. A bit hot on the finish. This is a big, in-your-face, meaty whiskey that any barbecue brisket fan will relish."
5206,"<price>245<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' Glencraig (distilled at Glenburgie), Cask #2926, 30 year old, 1974 vintage, 42.0%<review>Soothing vanilla cream, with additional notes of spice cake, coconut marshmallow, tiramisu, fresh cut grass, and a hint of evergreen. A true ""comfort"" whisky. Just don’t add any water, because it will fall flat. This whisky is great just the way it is. 
"
5207,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Old Fourth Distillery Bottled in Bond Straight (Barrel 20), 50%<review>Roasted corn, peanut butter, vanilla extract, orange wedges, root beer, and licorice on the nose. The palate is oak-driven, chewy, and dense, carrying along an herbaceous streak that showcases dill, cedar, licorice, and black pepper, as well as peanuts, orange oil, and roasted corn. A few drops of water showcase the grain and nuts to even better advantage. Distilled in Indiana and aged in Georgia."
5208,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Springbank) 13 year old, 46%<review>Recently bottled by Duncan Taylor in their non-colored, non-chill filtered NC2 range, this 13 year old expression of Springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose, then smoked fish cooked in butter, coconut oil, brine, and a hint of lemon. More sweet wood smoke with time, turning to char. The palate opens with profound, sweet fruit, swiftly followed by salt, lime, and medicinal notes. Lingering, with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64"
5209,"<price>262<rating>93<whiskey>GlenDronach 21 year old Parliament, 48%<review>Part of the core range from GlenDronach, Parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered. Quite sweet sherry on the nose, with fresh leather, nutty peach notes, cloves, and pepper. Rich sherried fruits on the full palate, with more pepper, ginger, and plain chocolate. The finish is long, with licorice and oak tannins. Not to be rushed!"
5210,"<price>3000<rating>92<whiskey>Craigellachie 33 year old, 46%<review>This was previously exclusive to Travel Retail, but is now available in the U.S. Cereal and succulent tropical fruits on the nose, plus Craigellachie’s signature sulfur, along with cloves and polished oak. Toffee and orchard fruits on the muscular palate, with oatmeal and a mineral quality. The finish is long and yields another whiff of sulfur, lemon, and a hint of mint. A quirky dram of true quality. (1,700 bottles)"
5211,"<price>109<rating>90<whiskey>Port Askaig 15 year old Sherry Cask, 45.8%<review>Matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks, this is 20% peated whisky from 1997 and 80% fruitier whisky distilled in 2001. Earthy on the early nose, with bonfire smoke, vanilla, raisins, and prunes. The palate opens with sweet fruit notes and medium-dry sherry, giving way to nutmeg, brine, and peat. The finish features plain chocolate, bitter lemons, and a hint of smoky chili. £85"
5212,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Coppersea Excelsior Straight Bourbon (Batch 1901), 48%<review>Overripe fruit, orange Creamsicle (and its stick), cedar oil, and wood spice on the nose. The palate is tannic with robust orange, oak, cinnamon, cherry Luden’s cough drops, and herbal cough syrup. It finishes on oak, chocolate, nuts, and cinnamon—a bit hot, but softened with generous water."
5213,"<price>119<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Cameronbridge) 25 year old 1990, 60.6%<review>This refill butt has produced a perfumed and aromatic whisky with peach, green foliage, maize, a spritz of melon juice, and a pinch of ground cinnamon and nutmeg rubbed between the fingers. It’s zingy! Ginger sears the lips before the warmth of the ginger invades the mouth. The satin texture of honey and vanilla concludes with Spangles, before it enters a long, mouth-coating finish of sweet ginger. With water, soft, ripe fruit abounds; the ginger harmonizes rather than attacks. (282 bottles) £83"
5214,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>The Irishman Founder’s Reserve Caribbean Cask Finish Small Batch 2018, 46%<review>An interesting experiment in single cask finishing involved transferring the whiskey into St Lucia rum casks for 6 months. This has dried papaya, apricot, barley notes, hints of sherry, and robust pot still spices. Vanilla fudge sweetness, bountiful tropical flavors of passion fruit, mango, papaya—though never overtly sweet—it still has plenty of spiciness, with later traces of chocolate, café mocha, and nut butters. (380 bottles)"
5215,"<price>24<rating>82<whiskey>The Knot, 50%<review>William Grant’s answer to Drambuie is a much less sweet and higher proof Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Monster caramel leaps out of the glass with an undercurrent of cola. Caramel leads to chocolate on the palate before malt and grain whiskey undertones emerge. Mid-palate is a little hot, but it helps cut through the underlying sweetness and also features some botanicals like juniper and black pepper. Clearly a mixing spirit and probably best thrown into a cola or ginger ale."
5216,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Garioch, 1991, Duncan Taylor Rare Auld range, 51.1%<review>Melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral, especially carnations. Progressively more caramel, with Parma violet sweets. Pretty and feminine. Richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. Fresh fruit, apple juice, almonds, and gentle spices, slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. The faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor, but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble. "
5217,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Baker’s, 53.5%<review>Rich, multi-layered nose: vanilla, cornmeal, berries (black raspberries, wineberries), and broad-shouldered oak. Powerful, but not overproof hot in the mouth; controlled. The berries sing a high counter-melody over the corn-oak beat as the whole experience rocks along. It’s powerful, sweet, authoritative, and finishes with a reprise of it all: berries, corn, vanilla, and stronger oak. Mature, complete bourbon with a 7 year age statement, and a real sleeper in the Small Batch Collection."
5218,"<price>40<rating>75<whiskey>Stillhouse The Original Moonshine, 40%<review>Aromas are soft and creamy, with a waft of sweet corn — underlain with a fairly blunt alcohol burn that comes through more as you smell it. Quite sweet on the palate, a wash of green corn, but the flavor isn’t enough to tangle successfully with the fuel, which leads to a tongue-curlingly hot finish. Some definite potential, but it really needs time in a big oak barrel (or some ice and a bottle of Dr. Pepper). "
5219,"<price>139<rating>82<whiskey>Amrut Port Pipe Peated Single Cask #2714, 59<review>Full port maturation has been tried by distilleries great and small. What does the cask contribute to the spirit beyond being soaked in port? Empress plums and bramble jelly meet smoke in the form of snuffed candlewicks and smoldering cedar sticks. At cask strength, it’s sharp and puckering but after the plummy opener fades there is rosehip, licorice, zested lime, and a squirt of lemon. Water keeps the licorice, but bottoms out the sweetness for a mouth-filling dram. £82"
5220,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Tullibardine 500 Sherry, 43%<review>Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks, Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla. The palate is smooth and sherried, with more leather, brittle toffee, orange peel, honey, and nutmeg. The fruity finish is notably spicy, with lingering wood polish notes. "
5221,"<price>175<rating>91<whiskey>The Dalmore Mackenzie 1992 Vintage, 46%<review>A tribute to the Mackenzie Clan. Aged in bourbon barrels for 11 years, and then aged an additional 6 years in port pipes, creating a rich, voluptuous, robust Dalmore expression. Notes of toffee, molasses, caramelized nuts, pancake batter, fig cake, and chocolate-covered citrus. Subtle glazed ginger and orange marmalade add complexity. Polished oak, tobacco-tinged finish. Very dynamic and never sappy or cloying. Save this one for after dinner."
5222,"<price>3360<rating>96<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1954 (Cask #1260), 47.2%<review>A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple, dried peach, apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful, long, and resonant. Superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity. £1,995"
5223,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Murray McDavid 16 year old 1990 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 46%<review>Finished (or ACE’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a Madeira cask. Soft in texture, and deceivingly seductive in nature. Pleasingly sweet (honey, caramel, aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. A soft, pleasing Macallan with everything in balance. Nicely done."
5224,"<price>1980<rating>90<whiskey>The Dalmore Ceti 30 year old, 45%<review>The Dalmore spirit that comprises Ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks, with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in American oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts. The result is a nose of old leather, hessian, sandalwood, vanilla, plain chocolate, and ripe Jaffa oranges. Very full-bodied, with burnt orange, pineapple, and sticky toffee, while the finish offers ginger, orange wine gums, and old oak. 1,000 bottles. £1,250"
5225,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Douglas Laing Scallywag, 46%<review>Douglas Laing follows up its award winning, Islay-soaked Big Peat with this, a sherried Speyside whisky. Just as Big Peat looks like Captain Haddock from Tintin, Scallywag on the label is a dead ringer for Snowy, though the official story is different. Anyway, this whisky isn't a patch on the Islay monster. Rootsy green salad malt is only partially rescued by the trademark Christmas cake and stewed fruits. Likeable, but not a classic. £45"
5226,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Lagavulin 9 year old, 46%<review>Lagavulin at an odd age, representing House Lannister and showcasing its lion sigil. The nose is floral, with rose hips, toffee, and fragrant peat notes. Full on the palate, with toffee apples, cinnamon, earthy peat, and smoked haddock in salted butter. The smoked fish combines with fennel in the lengthy finish."
5227,"<price>60<rating>63<whiskey>Distillery Select 'Inchmoan' (distilled at Loch Lomond), Cask #151, 13 year old, 1992 vintage, 45%<review>Fiery peat kiln smoke, tar, and ripe barley on the nose. Not overly complex, but not a problem either. On the palate, the whisky starts out acceptable enough. But by mid-palate, the whisky turns harsh and unpleasant, with petroleum and vegetal notes that continues through to the finish. (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.) 
"
5228,"<price>129<rating>94<whiskey>Lucky Seven 12 year old The Proprietor Single Barrel Kentucky Straight (Barrel No. 7), 59.15%<review>
Initially tight on the nose, the gentle vanilla and delicate spice are draped in leather and dusty oak floorboards. Maturity is present on the palate as well, not only in the full body, but also in the form of intense vanilla and citrus furniture polish, like orange oil. At the same time, it’s quite lively, as a burst of dark fruits, cassis, and licorice rises from the depths before the drying oak finish."
5229,"<price>172<rating>89<whiskey>Wemyss Malts ‘Winter Spice’ Single Cask, 44.4%<review>This cask strength, 29 year old 1982 expression in the Wemyss Malts range is the company’s first bottling of a single malt distilled at the Northern Highland distillery of Teaninich. Just 201 bottles have been released. The insistently fruity nose features overripe pears, heather in bloom, soft fudge, salted popcorn, cinnamon, and ginger. Soft and peachy on the palate, with darker spice notes, walnuts, and plain chocolate. The finish is lengthy, with more plain chocolate and some spiced oak. £110"
5230,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Charbay R5 French Oak Aged, 49.5%<review>Take the Charbay R5 Clear and add some vanilla and toast notes: interesting. The flavors…on first sip, the mellowing richness of the oak makes for a nice entry. But the wood blunts the zip of the hoppy beer wash without adding enough to compensate for the loss, and makes for a hotter finish. It’s still interesting, but the wood gets in the way of what this can be. "
5231,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Bushmills Rum Cask #10623, 43%<review>Irish whiskey and rum aren't a common combination, but Bushmills makes a strong case for it with a 19 year old whiskey finished in a rum cask. The rum's influence is clearly present on the nose, with brown sugar that supports Bushmills’ toasted malt. On the palate the rum's dark molasses complements Bushmills’ chocolate malty goodness. Everything balances out in the mid-palate with the addition of oak, which carries through to a semi-dry finish. Superb integration of unlikely cask mates.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
5232,"<price>48<rating>91<whiskey>Powers Three Swallow, 43.2%<review>Rich dried fruits, candied peel, dried apricot, mango strips, white pepper, herbal notes, almond paste, and sweet grapefruit flesh—this has signature notes of Powers all over it. Thick and velvety, there’s warm marmalade, sugared almonds, golden barley, citrus, and green apple. It’s all quite mellow until the spices work themselves up into a bit of a frenzy. Long fruity finish, with toasted coconut and a luscious, billowing spiciness."
5233,"<price>46<rating>76<whiskey>McKenzie Rye Whiskey, 45.5%<review>Young, but dark; this one's finished in sherry barrels. Peppery, sweet, fruity aromas make it hard to separate the whiskey from the sherry influence. Lots of sherry wood in the mouth, too; oily, waxy, but the whiskey comes through clearly now, with sheaves of rye rolling across the tongue. The sherry is too heavy-handed, it has more presence than it should. Maybe more blending of un-sherried whiskey would work. "
5234,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg 5 year old Wee Beastie, 47.4%<review>
Full-on Ardbeg on the nose! Hot tar, lemon juice, charcuterie, thick peat smoke, ginger, and a hint of Jaffa oranges. The palate is oily and well-integrated, with black pepper, coal tar soap, cloves, vanilla, and orchard fruits. Spicy in the lengthy finish, with more tar, peat, and salty oak."
5235,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich 12 year old, 46%<review>Finished in a rum cask. Gold with a greenish tinge. Notes of ripe barley, demerara sugar, toasted marshmallow, and sultana, with underlying vanilla and subtle brine emerging on the finish. A pleasant, easy-going Laddie. (Bottled for Bayway World of Liquor)"
5236,"<price>97<rating>80<whiskey>Glenkinchie, 59.3%<review>Another whisky that will not disappoint fans of the brand, but it doesn’t do enough to bring any converts on board. The nose is fresh and sweet, with barley and ginger and not much else. The taste is perfectly acceptable, and at this strength better than the standard bottling. Water brings out a sweet malt and barley core, some gentle spice, and a rich sweetness."
5237,"<price>35<rating>90<whiskey>High West Double Rye, 46%<review>A blend of two straight whiskeys: a very young 2 year old high rye content whiskey and a 16 year old rye whiskey with a lower rye content. Perhaps the spiciest American whiskey I have ever tasted, yet at the same time, quite tame and mellow. Complex notes of mint, clove, cinnamon, licorice root, pine nuts, and dark chocolate, with a surprising dose of gin botanicals throughout. A soft underbelly of caramel, sweet corn, and soothing vanilla provides an interesting counterpoint. Very easy-drinking, too (hard to believe it’s 46%). Intriguing, and a must-try for rye whiskey aficionados — even if only to satisfy your curiosity."
5238,"<price>41<rating>87<whiskey>Strathcolm 12 year old, 40%<review>The oldest in the Strathcolm trio of whiskies, this has greater depth and richness on the nose, with caramel, ground hazelnut, whole-wheat bagels, honey, and fragrant roasted spices. With cinnamon-dusted Quaker Oats, honey, vanilla, and spice on the tongue, this has more body, with deeply toasted spice and honey sweetness on the finish. (3,000 bottles)"
5239,"<price>71<rating>84<whiskey>Bowmore 2016 vintage Fèis Ìle, 54.9%<review>This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive Islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. £55"
5240,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Discovery Series Kentucky Straight Bourbon (No. 2), 61.1%<review>A basket of berries—blue, black, and rasp—plus brown sugar, dark chocolate, iced tea, and walnuts in syrup on the nose. The berries carry through to the palate, though it’s more chocolate-oriented, with cocoa powder, coffee bean, and peanut butter-swirled brownies. It’s full and deep, and remarkably smooth without water, though a drop or two doesn’t go amiss. The finish is full and lengthy, with chocolate, roasted walnuts, rich oak, and a hint of spice. Outstanding. (8,340 bottles)"
5241,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Jura Prophecy, 46%<review>Like “Superstition,” this is a peated expression of Jura. Compared to Superstition, Prophecy seems richer, heavier, sweeter, deeper, leafier, with more tarry notes. I’m also picking up more spice (cinnamon, anise, dark chocolate) and some fruit (lime, mandarin orange, green apple), with a subtle yet intriguing suggestion of burnt popcorn. Prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered—which I think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. The only tradeoff is that I’m picking up less of the Jura spirit and less sea characteristics. But this is a small tradeoff, considering how much more you’re getting with Prophecy. Promoted as a limited annual release."
5242,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>BenRiach Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood Finish 15 year old, 46%<review>As the name implies, this non-chill filtered expression was finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry butts. The nose offers sweet sherry, honey, malt, and lemon, while the palate yields more sherry, plain chocolate, honey, spicy toffee, and a hint of orange. More spicy toffee, plus drying oak in the medium-length finish."
5243,"<price>85<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich Links Torrey Pine 15 year old, 46%<review>The 8th in a series of “Links” releases. This one’s further enhanced in Chateau Latour Bordeaux casks. Bright, fruity notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, and candy apple. Teasing fresh brine emerges occasionally, along with citrus, mango, and vanilla. A very perky whisky."
5244,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Lux Row Distillers 12 year old Double Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 59.2%<review>Deeply inviting on the nose and satisfying on the palate. Aromas of iced tea, orange Tang, peanuts, dark fruit, weathered oak, leather, and spices comingle with the freshness of an alpine retreat. Flavors and texture fill the mouth: chewy oak, semi-sweet chocolate, cinnamon plums, walnuts, cherry cough syrup, orange oil, and cloves. Cooked dark fruit, semi-sweet chocolate, and copious mature oak on the finish, which is velvety and expansive. Needless to say, at this proof, it benefits from generous amounts of water. (6,000 bottles)"
5245,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Bird Dog Kentucky Bourbon, 40%<review>Quite an unusual start: melted butter poured over brown rice followed by caramel, vanilla, and fried sweet potatoes. Although the ABV suggests it’s light, the body actually holds up quite well with notes of banana, quince, marzipan, bread pudding, and vanilla. Alas, the short finish doesn’t follow suit, only offering a hint of caramel."
5246,"<price>170<rating>87<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Benrinnes) 20 year old, 52.7%<review>Distilled in October 1995 and aged in refill hogshead #8937. Slightly earthy on the early nose, with allspice, vanilla, then creamy toffee and caramel notes emerge. Big, boiled sweet notes on the full palate: nutmeg, soft toffee, and aniseed. Long and drying in the finish, with chili spice. (261 bottles)"
5247,"<price>110<rating>94<whiskey> Penderyn 10 year old Madeira Cask-Finished Single Cask Single Malt (No. 047-3), 58.1%<review>When you feel you’ve earned a treat, pour a dram of this bottled candy. The nose is a tropical fruit basket, with papaya, guava, mango, jackfruit, and dried kiwi; extra goodies come in the form of Jordan almonds and vanilla sandwich cookies. Consistent tropical flavors on the silky palate. Nuttiness, gentle spice, milk chocolate, and coffee bean emerge with water. Intensely satisfying on the finish, with persistent fruit, integrated oak, almonds, and grapefruit peel. (243 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5248,"<price>48<rating>80<whiskey>Glencadam The Rather Delicate 10 year old, 46%<review>Fresh citrus notes and pear drops on the nose, plus a newly-opened packet of printer paper. The palate is quite full-bodied and fruity, with some white pepper. More citrus on the palate, with spicy, freshly-sawn wood. The finish is relatively long and fruity. Uncomplicated, but a good introduction to the brand. £30"
5249,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Glenlivet 14 year old Cognac Cask Selection, 40%<review>This U.S.-exclusive release was initially aged in first-fill American oak sherry casks before a period of finishing in cognac casks. Spicy red wine notes on the notably aromatic nose, with vanilla and light cinnamon. Good texture in the mouth, sweet, and very approachable, with tangerines, toffee, dates, sultanas, and milk chocolate. Liqueur chocolates in the smooth, lengthy finish. Not overly complex, but robust and extremely drinkable."
5250,"<price>85<rating>92<whiskey>Remus Repeal Reserve (Series II), 50%<review>An opulent nose of dense chewy caramel, butterscotch pudding, and maple syrup gains depth from nutty, earthy, and tobacco leaf notes. The maturity appears in appealing glimpses of varnish and wood polish. The palate, too, doesn’t disappoint, with the rich and creamy sweetness balanced with generous oak tannins, lending fine balance. On the finish, look for drying cedar and oak, with clove and pepper. A blend of four different Indiana high-rye bourbons distilled in 2007 and 2008."
5251,"<price>520<rating>88<whiskey>Bowmore 27 year old Port Cask, 48.3%<review>Port Cask is the third and final release in Bowmore’s Vintner’s Trilogy. It was matured for 13 years in bourbon barrels, then 14 years in port pipes. Woodsmoke and blackcurrant on the mildly medicinal nose, with developing sea salt and vanilla fudge. Smoky dried fruit on the palate, with a hint of brine. Old oak, antiseptic, and black pepper in the finish."
5252,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Ohishi Islay Cask-Finished, 42.7%<review>
Drink this the next time you want a mug of hot chocolate by a roaring peat fire. Whole lemon, earthy chocolaty peat notes, gentle ashy smoke, mocha, and Nutella on the nose, with some deeper sooty charcoal notes. After a 32-month finish in Islay casks, this carries plenty of weight, with flavors of chocolate brownie, dates, cocoa powder, and light ground pepper that intensifies into a riot of smokin’ hot peppercorns. (1,242 bottles)"
5253,"<price>133<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Peaches and Cream 1989 (distilled at Glen Garioch), 46%<review>This 25 year old single cask bottling of Glen Garioch from Wemyss was one of a dozen released in late 2014. The hogshead in which maturation took place yielded 357 bottles. The nose gives apple, banana, vanilla fudge, nutmeg, and soft spices. Creamy and nutty on the palate, with a squeeze of lemon, soft toffee, and milk chocolate. The finish is medium in length, spicy and nutty, with cocoa powder and just a suggestion of smoke. £87"
5254,"<price>79<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Vanilla Summer Single Cask, 46%<review>The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes Vanilla Summer. It is an unspecified Highland single malt, distilled in 1997, and the bourbon cask in which it was matured has yielded 263 bottles. Vanilla, buttercups, and violets on the nose, developing Bramley apples with peaches and cream. Background of mildly spicy malt. Sweet and floral on the palate, with tropical fruits, fudge, and ginger. Slowly drying with benevolent oak, but ultimately a lingering creaminess. £50 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5255,"<price>51<rating>88<whiskey>Driftless Glen 51 Rye, 51%<review>Driftless Glen Distillery’s third rye expression, named for its 51% rye mash (compared to 74% in their core rye) as well as its 51% ABV. The nose has notes of orange peel, apricot, fragrant oak, bitter chocolate, burnt sugar, ginger, mint, and citrus oil. A rich, spicy palate offers more chocolate, as well as chili powder, tarragon, and cigar ash. A long finish of tobacco leaf, chocolate custard, and cinnamon."
5256,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Sagamore Spirit Distiller’s Select Manhattan Finish, 51.5%<review>
The savory and spice qualities here are really captivating, as spicy Slim Jim converges with Christmas cake, mulled wine with spices, plum pudding, anise cookies, and quinine. The palate suggests sherry, with its heaps of dried fruits, brandied cherries, and star anise. Despite the decadent fruit, it’s not too far afield for any whiskey lover, with drying tannins and added character from finishing in cherry brandy, vermouth, and bitters barrels."
5257,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Barrell American Whiskey (Batch 002), 61.9%<review>Two things show almost immediately: alcohol level and sherry cask. Heat and salty nuttiness really express themselves early on, eventually followed by flavors of caramel chew, graham cracker, nutmeg, and cinnamon, with an unwanted bitterness. Walnut shell and smoked meat come along too, for a medium finish that tingles. With a drop of water, its bitterness turns to oak, making it the preferred way to sip its hefty proof. Sourced whiskey."
5258,"<price>7<rating>80<whiskey>Grand Grizzly, 40%<review>An all-rye grain mash yields this almost tequila-like whisky that was blended to tempt the agave-blessed Mexican palate. Hot, earthy, and somewhat muddy, with the black pepper signature of tequila, it gradually becomes sweet and creamy with vague hints of black licorice. Strong herbal undertones suggest dill pickles. Hard slatey rye grain softens into blue clay. The sintering heat lingers right to the end, as do earthiness and agave-like black pepper ¡Hola! (Mexico only) 99 Mexican pesos"
5259,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel 100% Rye (Cask 82), 46%<review>Seven years after distilling their first drop, Still Waters can barely keep up with demand. The single malt distillery took a giant step forward when partners Barry Stein and Barry Bernstein decided to mash some rye grain. Rye is now more than half of their production. Waxy, sizzling-hot spices and a lovely leafy sweetness lead to softer peppers, hints of vanilla, and a mildly floral palate. Linseed oil and a slippery palate suggest chocolate, but only just."
5260,"<price>12<rating>81<whiskey>Monarch of the Glen, 40%<review>Aromas of liquid honey, light toffee, dried apple, and satsuma peel. There is an initial citric attack, but when the flare dies down, a residual bitterness cuts through the underlying creaminess and caramel. Sure, its component whiskies lack substance and grip, but there is some flavor progression through to an enjoyable piquancy around the gums. The finish is a nippy buzz of peel and heather honey. Simple, uncomplicated, but for the price there’s plenty to like here."
5261,"<price>27<rating>79<whiskey>Canadian Shield, 43%<review>Family-owned Domaine Pinnacle uses rye, malted barley, and corn spirits to create a lovely, if typical, Canadian blended whisky. Their 430-acre farm, just a stone’s throw from the Vermont border in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, produces award-winning apple cider too. Prune juice, raspberries, toffee, hints of coffee; lush, mild vegetal notes on the nose. Peppery, sweet, creamy, and somewhat simple. Lovely burn. Traditional Canadian whisky with a bite.

5262,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Tawny Port Wine Barrel-Finished Bourbon, 55.8%<review>The second release in Angel’s Envy’s Cellar Collection, this one features 10 year old bourbon finished 10 months in tawny port casks. Pleasant oak and barrel char on the nose underpin playful notes of strawberry, cotton candy, and raisins. The palate is rich, with chocolate-covered mint, figs, and orange. Polished oak, bitter chocolate, red fruits, and blackberry punctuate the finish. A touch of water brings on a burst of flavors. (5,400 bottles)"
5263,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Old Fashioned Sour Mash, 50%<review>This first limited-edition Taylor release attempts to recreate the “sour mash” process used a century ago. Sweet on the nose and palate (fruit gumdrops, sweet corn, vanilla wafer). Spicy too (cinnamon, evergreen), and clinging on the palate. The sweetness is rescued late, with a firm, dry oak finish. Reminds me of an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that puts the brakes on at the end. Not the most balanced, but certainly distinctive."
5264,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Batch Proof (2019 Release), 61.6%<review>Known for pushing boundaries, the Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection series has been a mixed bag over the years. With Batch Proof, Woodford literally plays to its strength. This bourbon takes the same mashbill, flavor profile, and beautiful blending that makes up the standard 90.4-proof Woodford Reserve, and ups the intensity to 123.2 proof, uncut and unfiltered. “Batch Proof” is Woodford’s answer to other distilleries’ single-barrel products. Now an annual spring release, Batch Proof doubles down on what Woodford does best, upping the banana pudding, dark spice, and toasty oak notes to decadent new heights. Number 6 in the 2019 Top 20 "
5265,"<price>22<rating>77<whiskey>H5 Iced Single Grain, 40%<review>Boldly, this is naturally colored (barely colored) 3 year old grain whisky presented in a tall, clear bottle. The predominant aroma of corn husks is mixed with a sentimental schoolroom whiff of white glue peeled from the fingertips. There’s wheat cracker, bread, cooked ham, dripping foliage, and chopped parsley. A clean, refreshing mouthfeel with pleasant marshmallow sweetness is nixed by flavors of corn, sliced bread, and vanilla, but they are hastily extinguished. A finishing spicy glimmer shuts down quickly too."
5266,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan Valinch 2012, 57.2%<review>This is the second edition of Auchentoshan’s cask strength Valinch bottling, which carries no age statement and has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. As with the previous Valinch expression, only 2,000 cases have been released globally. Very fragrant on the nose, with pears, applesauce, and vanilla fudge. Spice, cream, and lively Jaffa oranges on the palate. A touch of (not unpleasant) new make spirit comes through in the relatively lengthy finish."
5267,"<price>83<rating>83<whiskey>Glen Breton Rare 10 year old, 43%<review>It is unfortunate that Glenora does not mark lot numbers, as each succeeding batch improves over previous ones. Gone are the soapy notes that oozed out of the bottle, keeping early releases from showing their strength. While the nose is big, on the palate the whisky becomes light, with brisk spiciness, some malt, and subtle oak. Glen Breton is known for its red apple notes and gentle flowers. To these now add pepper, honey, caramel, and light oak."
5268,"<price>350<rating>89<whiskey>Talisker 30 year old, 50.7%<review>A graceful Talisker. Soft toffee and caramel with balanced, gentle fruit. Hints of boat dock wood, damp peat, and fish nets. Warming spice notes (anise, pepper, and salt) provide intrigue and linger on through a warming, spicy finish. Well rounded, with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions."
5269,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>The Irishman Founder’s Reserve, 40%<review>Butter, salted caramel, vanilla fudge, firm but tolerant spices—notably white pepper—red apple, and strands of orange zest. After a juicy orange opener, a delicious wave breaks over the tongue, bringing toffee, caramel, cappuccino, hints of chocolate, and a good balance of spices. The finish is spiced fruit with notes of burnt butter, clove, and coffee. This signature blend is consistently one of their best whiskeys."
5270,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Koval Single Barrel Oat American Whiskey (No. 5G8X2W), 40%<review>Piney and herbaceous on the nose, with Popsicle stick, lemongrass, fresh oregano, Lemon Pledge, and a hint of vanilla. Light-bodied and silky in texture, it has plenty of vanilla and toasted wood sweetness, along with hints of herbs. The finish is short and a bit hot, with simple oak flavors."
5271,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Four Roses 13 year old Barrel Strength, 52.1%<review>A single barrel offering to celebrate Distillery Manager Jim Rudtledge’s 40 years in the industry. Dry, botanical, and teasingly complex, with bright fruit, crisp spice, and complex oak. Its dryness is prevalent throughout-the maturity is evident-but never excessively so, and there’s always a soft interplay of honey and vanilla. A very elegant whiskey.

5272,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Old Overholt Bonded Rye, 50%<review>Initial aromas of toasted nuts, nougat, and pistachio. Water releases cedar and sandalwood along with citrusy grapefruit notes.

Best Value"
5273,"<price>190<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Kirsch Gateau (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1988, 56%<review>Polished rosewood. Big sherried notes, but also generous sweetness. Vermouth-like: dark fruits, a hint of spice, light oxidation, with some herbal edges and Morello cherries. Becomes balsamic. The palate is highly concentrated, with more cherry, but has this intense savory astringency. Water is needed. The nose continues to be remarkable, all damask rose and resin, but dilution can’t eradicate the mouth-puckering quality. £130"
5274,"<price>215<rating>88<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Highland Park) 1981 vintage, 50.6%<review>Honey, creamy vanilla, caramel, sultana, and toasted almond along with a hint of lemon gum drops and banana. Quite floral, too -- lavender, heather -- with a gentle, lingering finish. A very soothing, mouth-coating whisky with excellent balance, while still quite fresh. Indeed, a very more-ish whisky -- and sneaky in how it grows on you with each sip."
5275,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>G. Miclo Welche’s Whisky Single Malt, 43%<review>A sauternes cask-matured whisky from Alsace with a sweet nose of vanilla, caramel, soft stone fruit, macaroon bars, and coriander seed. The sluggish palate takes a while to get going, with flavors of citrus peel, barley sugar, and ground ginger. While there’s a medley of fruit and spice, it all feels a little half-hearted. Short finish as the fruit fades. (1,000 bottles)"
5276,"<price>100<rating>80<whiskey>Milford 20 year old, 43%<review>This is from the stock of aged Willowbank whisky that  was marketed under the Milford label before ending up as whisky from Thomson. You following this? It’s sweet, with an attractive soft melon center, but sharp pepper kicks in and coats the mouth, staying forever. "
5277,"<price>36<rating>92<whiskey>1792 Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>While this offers no age statement, it revels in the renewed respect for bottled in bond whiskey which assures us it is at least 4 years old, 100 proof, from one distillery, and one distilling season. This new appreciation is for good reason. Toasted oak, chocolate-covered banana, vanilla, and apple meet hints of coffee and cinnamon on the nose. The high-rye recipe delivers the requisite cracked pepper and baking spices on the caramel-laden palate laced with licorice. This widely available bourbon seems to dwell in the age sweet spot, is nicely balanced with oak, and comes at a price that leaves little cause for hesitation. Number 9 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
5278,"<price>618<rating>87<whiskey>Fettercairn 28 year old, 42%<review>Aged in bourbon casks, this offers a nose of farmyard aromas, ginger, and treacle. Quite thin in the mouth, with nutty toffee, dried apricots, and spicy black coffee. Dark chocolate, licorice, raisins, dark oak, and persistent cocoa powder in the spicy, very long finish. Quirky, and one for lovers of the slightly arcane. (£500)"
5279,"<price>83<rating>89<whiskey>Scallywag 13 year old, 46%<review>Scallywag is no lapdog; this mutt runs off the leash and disappears down a rabbit hole. The first thing that strikes is a spicy blast of cardamom, fennel, and onion seeds. Baked chestnut, grapefruit, baked orange, plum, and walnut aromas. Warm marmalade with thick peel, a fanfare of spices, and brown sugar cubes. Gratifying finish of grapefruit peel and a burning core of spice deep in the throat."
5280,"<price>116<rating>87<whiskey>Puni Alba, 43%<review>Backyard bonfire smoke, black pepper, charred oak, aniseed, and smoked fish, going from peppered mackerel to Arbroath smokie, but the smokiness from the Islay cask finish overpowers this young whisky at times, hindering the appreciation of other distillate characters. To taste, there’s sugared breakfast cereal, fudge donut glaze, vanilla, stewed apple, black currant, pepper, clove, and background smoke, with a pepper and salted caramel finish."
5281,"<price>61<rating>88<whiskey>Teerenpeli Savu, 43%<review>Matured in 80% bourbon and 20% Pedro Ximénez casks, this has Golden Delicious apples, melon, and banana on the nose, with aromatic peat smoke drawing weighty spices in their wake. It’s a beautifully honeyed dram, supported by melon, golden sultana, and a touch of lime. The crest of clove, black pepper, and sooty smoke is kept at bay by that golden sweetness, ahead of a tingling, spicy finish. €55"
5282,"<price>600<rating>93<whiskey>The Balvenie 1974 vintage (Cask #17893), 52.8%<review>The newest offering from the impressive Balvenie vintage cask line. Honey, caramel custard, and Seville orange notes, with evolving -- and increasingly noticeable -- dried spice, oak resin, and leather that integrates well with the sweet, fruity notes. Incredible depth and complexity. The Balvenie vintage reputation remains intact."
5283,"<price>684<rating>90<whiskey>Canadian Rockies 35 year old Cask Strength, 79.9%<review>Matured in bone-dry Alberta, where the angels quenched their thirst with water, not alcohol, and the strength steadily climbed over the 35 years spent in wood. Butterscotch, but no inkling of spirit, yet blistering heat on the palate. Surprisingly smooth, though your tongue simply glows. Water adds complexity: dry grain, fresh denim, dust, peaches, green apples, sweet woodiness, and a long blazing finish. Pretty spectacular. (Taiwan only) NT$22,310"
5284,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>Bernheim Original Single Barrel 7 year old (barrel #5132718), 45%<review>In a market myopically focused on big, old, and oaky, this Bernheim Original single barrel is an uncommon, subtle whiskey that invites you to lean in and listen closer. If you do, you’ll be treated to soft wheat intertwined with caramel, cinnamon, and subtle cherry. Oak gets added to the mix in the mid-palate, without dropping any of the other flavors established. The real star of this whiskey is the finish: long, dry, ice-cube cool, and extremely impressive. (Drink Up New York only)"
5285,"<price>790<rating>95<whiskey>Royal Salute 28 year old Kew Palace Edition, 40%<review>Fresh spring floral bouquets, white peach, and nectarine tumble with sweet caramel, dried cherry, white chocolate, fresh linen notes, and vanilla cake batter. Silky smooth with fresh summer fruits, the strong peppery spices push to the fore, but this is nimble, graceful, and displays a real lightness. Compelling, captivating blending for the Flask Collection by Sandy Hyslop, this has a fragrance you could enjoy all night."
5286,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Arran Orkney Bere, 46%<review>The ancient variety of barley known as bere that was used to make this Arran single malt was grown on Orkney and distilled in 2004. It was matured for eight years in bourbon barrels, and 5,800 bottles have been released. Very fruity on the nose, principally peaches, with vanilla and fudge, something slightly herbal, wet grass, and finally homemade lemonade. Oily mouthfeel, with fresh oak, cloves, and wild berries. An atypical Arran! The finish is drying and moreish. £48"
5287,"<price>87<rating>88<whiskey>Teerenpeli Distiller’s Choice Karhi, 43%<review>Peeling back the wrapper on a British chocolate bar studded with whole almonds, only to find an unexpected puff of spices; green cardamom pod and toasted fenugreek. Intriguing, never pungent. Given the spectrum of flavors in Madeira, this finish pushes the richness and complexity of the wine; raisin, coffee, and dried fruits make it sweet, concentrated, and mouth drawing. It relaxes to a toffee plateau with riffs on ripe date and coffee. The short coffee finish sees the chocolate return. (1,882 bottles) £60"
5288,"<price>29<rating>85<whiskey>Uisce Beatha Real Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>This is straightforward, straight shootin’ Irish whiskey. Creamy country fudge, toasted muffins, glorious sweet malt, waxed lemons, and delicate spices on the first sniff. It’s light in the mouth, with lemon curd, juicy caramels, and vanilla custard tarts: simply bursting with warmth. It concludes with spices twinkling on a malt theme. Have your Irish whiskey experiences only been with the big names? Go live a little. You ought to get this: sugar and spice and all things nice."
5289,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>Jailers Premium Tennessee Whiskey, 43%<review>Sweet corn and dried cherries on the nose; pleasantly, quirkily intense. The palate is clean, sweet with corn and a hint of those cherries, framed by oak, and leads to a finish with no surprises: corn, oak, and a slight clench of heat. It’s almost predictable: there are no real flaws, but there’s no greatness, either. Still, solid delivery is a good thing. (sourced whiskey) —LB"
5290,"<price>45<rating>93<whiskey>Kilbeggan Single Pot Still, 43%<review>

Among this year’s strong field of new single pot still releases, Kilbeggan bottled a gem of an Irish whiskey that sparkled brighter than them all. The already historic whiskey style achieves a powerful air of authenticity. First it’s distilled in the oldest working pot still in Ireland, and the 19th-century Locke family recipe incorporates 2.5% oats, a common addition at the time. Melon, candied peel, nutmeg, cinnamon, and honeysuckle aromas cascade into a palate made especially lush and creamy from the oats, with citrus peel, apricot, and roasted hazelnut flavors leading to a mellow, rounded finish, adeptly exhibiting a crisp articulation of pot still spiciness throughout. Number 8 in the 2020 Top 20"
5291,"<price>750<rating>91<whiskey>Glenfiddich 1977 Vintage (Cask #4414), 54.1%<review>Very elegant and refined. Obviously this whisky was aged in a pristine sherry cask. The flavors are quite clean and well-defined. Gently sweet and fruity, with golden raisin, candy apple, and red raspberry jam. There’s delicate pineapple, dried cherry, coconut, and vanilla too, with a polished oak finish. A very classy Glenfiddich. Not as bold and spicy as last year’s 1976 vintage (which I had a hand in selecting but, ironically, don’t like as much). This new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 Vintage release from two years ago which I still think is the best one in recent years."
5292,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2009), 57.9%<review>The aromas are tightly bound, but a little water releases them nicely. A powerful dram, with tarry, leafy, coal ash, caramel apple, and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). More subtle floral notes (heather, violet), Earl Grey tea, and smoked fish. Long, damp peat smoke and charcoal finish."
5293,"<price>12<rating>75<whiskey>Old Crow Reserve, 4 year old, 43%<review>A new “upgrade” from the standard Old Crow, which is only three years old. Soft aroma of sweet corn, candy corn, vanilla, and light caramel, all following through on the palate. It finishes sweet (too sweet, actually), a bit grainy, and slightly hot. If this brand is meant to compete with Evan Williams, then this four year old should be the standard “Old Crow” and the Reserve expression should be more like five or six years old, because the standard Evan Williams bottling (with no age statement) is clearly superior to Old Crow Reserve. Old Crow Reserve is too sweet and lacks the oak notes needed for balance and complexity. Acceptable enough as a mixing bourbon or perhaps on the rocks, but I wouldn’t drink this neat or with water."
5294,"<price>60<rating>78<whiskey>Boondocks 11 year old Cask Strength American Whiskey, 63.5%<review>There’s promise here, with peach, dried apricot, baking spice, and vanilla delighting the olfactory, and a slight hint of coffee just in case you needed it. But the intense heat shows itself and grain covers subtle sweetness and spice. The best high-proof whiskeys are actually quite smooth; this needs water to find its sweet spot. Sourced whiskey."
5295,"<price>29<rating>88<whiskey>Loch Lomond, 46%<review>A rare beast of 100% malted barley mash distilled in a Coffey still. Dried grasses, butterscotch toffee, honey spread across hot toast, fresh green apples, custard creams, and peppercorns leap from the glass. From the sweet apple, lemon, orange, and honey, it fleshes out with toffee apple, sweet vanilla, and cinnamon stick, concluding with a little more grain character and spice on the finish. Delicious stuff!"
5296,"<price>36<rating>86<whiskey>Pendleton 1910, 40%<review>Slaty minerals, fruitiness, and floral hints on the nose suggest plenty of rye in this satisfying, complex dram. More mineral notes emerge on the crisp, sweet palate, along with citrus elements, burley tobacco, hints of wine, dark chocolate, mild vanilla, and subtle oak. A soft peppery spice bursts onto the mid-palate and throat. A bit austere but with toffee sweetness and mild fudge. Mouth-filling, though a bit dry."
5297,"<price>700<rating>94<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 35 year old 1971 vintage, 44.9%<review>Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain!"
5298,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut Portonova, 61.2%<review>This release is a port version of Amrut’s Intermediate Sherry — a sort of port pipe sandwich. The spirit is matured in both unused casks and bourbon casks, then spends a few months in port pipes, and then returns to bourbon casks. The result is a Pink Floyd show of a whisky: vibrant, colorful, complex, and nearly too much. A blackcurrant and wispy, smoky nose gives way to an intense and bittersweet mix of chili, blackcurrant, oak, damson, dark chocolate, and peat. Astounding. "
5299,"<price>38<rating>78<whiskey>Big Bottom Barlow Trail Port Cask Finish, 45.5%<review>Big Bottom finishes their light-style Barlow Trail whiskey in 10 year old tawny port casks. On the nose it's promising, with oak, blackberry jam, orange, vanilla, and rye spice. The entry is soft and light with vanilla and berry, but it shifts dramatically in the mid-palate, which is exceptionally spicy and dry. Big Bottom’s previous port cask finishes have been blockbusters, but the light-style Barlow Trail whiskey doesn't have the same level of balance and integration to prevail."
5300,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Bruichladdich Infinity, 55.5%<review>Aged in a sherry cask, and the sherry is clean and bright. I’m also picking up a good dose of warming peat smoke, along with molasses, and a gentle maltiness throughout. A peppering of subtle brine and a hint of seaweed peak through occasionally, reminding one of its Islay roots."
5301,"<price>400<rating>89<whiskey>Port Ellen, 29 year old, 55.3%<review>An elder Port Ellen, but still showing plenty of Port Ellen character. It’s chock full of kiln smoke, damp forest, seaweed, charcoal, brine, and tar. Additional notes of licorice root, kalamata olive, cinnamon, and black pepper, with teasing citrus emerging occasionally. Warming, tarry, dry smoke finish. An old-fashioned, pungent Islay whisky.
"
5302,"<price>350<rating>87<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Copper & Kings Mistelle Barrel-Finished Bourbon, 49.95%<review>A very unusual nose for a bourbon, with notes of cedar, botanicals, juniper bush, pine forest, and sweet mesquite wood. A zingy, herbal palate offers dried orange peel and leather, but also sweeter notes of chocolate-covered marshmallows, black cherry, almonds, cotton candy, and oak. The finish has excellent length, ending with chocolate, allspice, espresso, old leather, and coffee ice cream. Deliciously chocolaty, spicy, and different."
5303,"<price>400<rating>88<whiskey>GlenAllachie 25 year old, 48%<review>The oldest bottling in the range, this was aged in a combination of Pedro Ximénez, oloroso, and American oak casks. Farmyard aromas, with oak and dark chocolate. Very smooth and supple on the palate, with orange marmalade, raisins, and old oak. The finish is quite short, with dried fruit and milky coffee. (160 bottles for U.S.)"
5304,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Distillery Master's Collection Four Grain, 46.2%<review>The first four-grain, 100% copper pot-distilled bourbon in many decades. The flavors are distinctive, silky-textured, and seamless. Bright fruit notes of berries and citrus are balanced nicely by maple syrup, caramel and toffee. The whiskey is quite nutty too and delicately spiced with vanilla, mint, and cinnamon. It finishes pleasingly smooth and polished.

5305,"<price>75<rating>94<whiskey>Powers John’s Lane, 46%<review>Wow! Could this be the greatest comeback since Rocky climbed back in the ring and showed the young upstarts who was the boss? It’s taken Irish Distillers a long time to respond to the pounding it’s taken from Cooley but it’s back in the ring with two wonderful pot still whiskeys. This is the better of the two, a whopping oily, woody package of classic pot still Irishness. The green fruits tumble over tannin and spice like frisky puppies. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)Editor's Choice"
5306,"<price>17<rating>86<whiskey>Old Overholt Straight Rye, 40%<review>A veteran rye whiskey brand that flaunts the floral quality of younger ryes with its summer flowers, bright citrus, and lemon oil notes. A well-polished palate, with warm porridge, and grain notes that smack of peanut butter on warm toast. Nice character and balance, if a touch anemic at this proof."
5307,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Glenkinchie Distillers Edition 1991 vintage, 43%<review>Matured in amontillado casks. Pleasantly fresh, briny, and yeasty, which works nicely with the atypical toffee and nutty notes. Glenkinchie’s dry, grassy character emerges occasionally, as does some delicate background spice and a hint of lime. Pretty hefty stuff for Lowland malt."
5308,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Trader Joe’s GlenAllachie 13 year old Speyside (Distilled in 2004), 40%<review>Earthiness and aromas of toffee apple, stewed fruit, ginger, allspice, walnuts, and dried figs sweep into a sweet, raisiny palate that also has flavors of candied nuts, semi-dark chocolate, dried fruit, caramel, and apples. Sweet, with almonds and chocolate on the finish—lots of tasty sherry flavors here, but an uncomplicated character. (Trader Joe’s)"
5309,"<price>119<rating>90<whiskey>Miyagikyo 15 year old, 45%<review>This single malt bottling shows Miyagikyo’s emollient style at its best. This is all about super-soft orchard fruits; think apricot and sweet persimmon, though there’s also a touch of sweet sawdust and even a whiff of pine sap and milk chocolate. It demonstrates the classic Japanese trick of being both clear and precise in its aromas, as well as being heightened in intensity. The palate is a little slow to start with, offering a mix of spruce and pine, then those soft fruits carry you onward.
In some ways the gentle charms of Miyagikyo are overshadowed by the rambunctious nature of From The Barrel and Yoichi, but soft is a worthy element in Japanese — nay, all — whisky. £76.95. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
5310,"<price>1500<rating>92<whiskey>Bowmore Oloroso Sherry Cask 1964 Vintage, 42.9%<review>Mahogany color. Medium to full in body, and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""Black Bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit, roasted nuts, fruit cake, polished leather, wood resin, and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet, fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish. This whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""Black Bowmore"" whiskies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this whisky next to the previous Black Bowmores, I can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish), this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer, sweeter, more rounded, and more seductive. This is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it, the more pleasure it gives you. 300 bottles."
5311,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Benromach 12 year old Origins (Batch 2), 50%<review>The newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from Gordon & MacPhail’s own distillery in Forres. This example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. Benromach is a teasing mid-weight Speysider, and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with Seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. Rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. This is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. Worth a look."
5312,"<price>600<rating>90<whiskey>Michter’s 20 year old Bourbon 2016, 57.1%<review>Gorgeous dried apricot, peach cobbler, vanilla custard, plus a hint of cherry-flavored pipe tobacco. Rich, layered, and rounded caramel, with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Then earth, and lots of it, over a slightly chewy mouthfeel of caramel chew and Red Hots cinnamon candy. Medium finish counters wonderful bouquet and palate notes, but still lovely for sipping."
5313,"<price>101<rating>84<whiskey>Cardhu 18 year old, 40%<review>Cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses of
citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. With
water, there’s red apple and Victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, with
any richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in a
Bobby Burns. Released without any fanfare, here’s evidence that Cardhu’s
rebuilding its reputation nicely. £66"
5314,"<price>72<rating>83<whiskey>Teeling Hybrid Malt Whisky Edition 1, 44.7%<review>Proof there is life after Cooley. Jack Teeling and whiskey innovator Alex Chasko kept the independent flame alive by moving on. This whisky isn't a revolution: it's a mix of Irish (Cooley) and scotch (Bruichladdich). That's not a new idea, and it does what you might predict. It starts with a sweet, fruity Irishness, then earthier, spicier Scottish notes kick in. It works fine, but this is a placeholder whisky. Expect a lot more in the coming months.  "
5315,"<price>55<rating>83<whiskey>Vicomte, 40%<review>A noble French single malt whisky from the Cognac region, pronounced ‘Veecont’ (Viscount). The barley is 100% organic, and the whisky makes the best use of French Limousin oak cognac barrel maturation for 8 years, with luscious results. The nose resounds with poached pear, overripe apricot, peach cordial, orange peel, toasted spices, crème brûlée, and fruit syrups. A satin smooth drinking experience shows sweet, burnt sugars, fruit cordials, and roasted lime slices. The finish is a ripe harvest of apricots. £36"
5316,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Templeton Barrel Strength Straight Rye (2018 Release), 57.2%<review>Top notes of spearmint and green apple part to reveal deeper nuances of golden raisin, saddle leather, varnish, and pine resin that suggest some maturity. Bright apple meets blazing spice on the palate, reminiscent of applesauce cake or warm spiced cider. The finish really soars, adding layers of tropical fruit and toasted banana-nut bread and licorice."
5317,"<price>168<rating>86<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 7.1, 59.1%<review>Distilled in 2009, so remember this is only 5 years old. At this stage there’s not a lot of cask, but there is an insanely intense smoky, herbal note like eucalyptus, celery, spruce, pine resin, then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. The palate is balanced between this intensity, big smoke, and Bruichladdich’s typical oily, sweet core. Water doesn’t affect it one little bit. It is bold, it is proud, it is in charge. I like its sheer ballsiness. £110"
5318,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Armorik Single Cask 8151, 46%<review>What happened when Warenghem Distillery’s David Roussier finished some of his famous Breton whisky for 2 years in a Dartigalongue Armagnac cask from the oldest Bas Armagnac production house? Sweet apple, pear, vanilla, lemon peel, and marzipan appear. A drink that awakens intense citrus sensations of marmalade, mixed peel, lemon and orange segments, followed by a light snap of pepper, gooseberries, nectarine flesh, and a lemony finish with hints of oak."
5319,"<price>38<rating>90<whiskey>Powers Gold Label, 43.2%<review>Ground cinnamon, coriander seed, nutmeg, mustard seed, spiced meat, and the saltiness of sand-encrusted seashells combine with a powerful honey note, fresh pear, golden sultana, and Cox’s apple. Quaker Oats, golden syrup, and chocolate-covered graham crackers with cherries set the scene, though spices quickly engulf them. Perfect harmony is reestablished as it fattens out with cinnamon toffee. Bold, robust, and triumphant: just add a Dublin pub weekend crowd and you’re all set."
5320,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Belle Meade 9 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask Finished, 45.2%<review>Buttery, nutty, and richly spiced, this has all the hallmarks of a sherry-finished whiskey—dried fruit, hazelnuts, chocolate—but retains its bourbon core with strong peanut, concord grape jelly, and roasted corn aromas. On the palate, it’s bourbon first: peanuts, cooked cherries, and plenty of oak. But the sherry softens and rounds out the mouthfeel, adding gentle spice, dried fruit, and silkiness."
5321,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Peerless (distilled at Glenlivet) 1968 34 year old, 45.9%<review>Deep gold color. Exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), vanilla, and honey. Medium bodied and firm. On the palate: honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit up front, becoming dry, with subtly complex spice notes. Deep, dry, lingering finish."
5322,"<price>127<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts ‘Caribbean Fruits,’ 46%<review>Wemyss Malts names the sources of these single cask bottlings for the first time in the series. ‘Caribbean Fruits’ is a 1990 Glencadam. The hogshead in which it was matured has yielded just 320 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with apricots, fudge, creamy vanilla, and drinking chocolate. Tropical fruits on the palate, with malt, hazelnuts, and spicy oak. Tannins and cocoa powder in the finish. £80"
5323,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Hirsch Rye, 25 year old, 46%<review>Enjoyable, dark sweet notes: molasses, maple syrup, fig, grilled corn. The spices are there, too (cool mint, cocoa powder, warming cinnamon, nutmeg). They’re well-rounded and show up more toward the finish (along with some tobacco and polished leather). Soft, reserved, and slightly past its prime, but it still maintains its dignity."
5324,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic Port Cask Finish, 40%<review>This is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose, opening up to reveal rose petals, milk chocolate, and double cream.  The palate is floral, with raisins  and red currants. Drying in the  finish, with peppery oak and  cinnamon."
5325,"<price>20<rating>87<whiskey>Hamilton’s Islay, 40%<review>Malt and seaweed drying around rock pools, this builds up a good head of dry, fibrous peat smoke, with sautéed mushrooms, chocolate nibs, and ozone. Sweet lemons and sugar mice on the palate, it slides into a creamy-smooth pool of milk chocolate, the smoke kicking in later on, dragging a layer of clove and pepper in its wake. Proof that an Islay experience need not break the bank."
5326,"<price>165<rating>89<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Glenlivet) 27 year old 1977 Vintage, 53.1%<review>Very stylish. Quite refined too, with notes of vanilla, peaches and flowering currant. The whisky is very soft on the palate, delicate and almost bashful at times. Indeed, it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself. The whisky finishes toasty, with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness. Some whiskies are great after dinner; others make wonderful pre-dinner drams. This one is great anytime."
5327,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Trader Joe’s 8 year old Speyside, 40%<review>If you aren’t expecting it, the herbaceous, grassy, mineral aromas are a surprise, more expected in an agave spirit than a typical Speysider. But there’s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon, licorice tea, chestnut honey, and saline, which resolve into a lightly sweet, slightly spiced finish. This is unusual, but beguiling. (Trader Joe’s)"
5328,"<price>549<rating>93<whiskey>Royal Salute 29 year old Pedro Ximénez Sherry Cask-Finished, 40%<review>This second release in the Flask Collection epitomizes deft management of PX finishing to produce an opulent treat. Honey and sherry notes, chunks of fruit-and-nut chocolate, melting caramel, plummy fruit, chocolate-covered raisins, refined dry spices, and stimulating peppercorn notes as the whisky warms. Thick and luxurious texture with vanilla, caramel, Seville orange, plum pudding, crème caramel, crystallized citrus, and melted chocolate, with a lightly spicy, sweet caramel finish."
5329,"<price>270<rating>93<whiskey>Hirsch Small Batch Reserve, 25 year old, 43.4%<review>Wonderfully complex on the nose and palate with great depth; plus, the oak is kept in check. Notes of molasses, graham cracker, Earl Grey tea, spring flowers, nougat, evergreen, warming cinnamon, and subtle tropical fruit, leading to a polished oak, charcoal-tinged finish. Very well done! The clear winner in this trio. 
"
5330,"<price>36<rating>87<whiskey>Tobermory 10 year old, 40%<review>Straw gold. Aromas of a sweet shop-vanilla, honey, marshmallow, and confectioner’s sugar. Light to medium body, and soft. Clean flavors, which are very malty and honeyed, with notes of marshmallow and vanilla. Gently sweet finish."
5331,"<price>35<rating>85<whiskey>Pendleton Midnight, 45%<review>Beginning with dried orange peels and steely rye that smells like a creek bed, the nose slowly develops light fruit, caramel, and vanilla fudge. Finally, pears, sweet plums, and raspberries emerge. On the palate, Midnight erupts into glowing hot spices, citrusy sweetness, dark fruits, candied ginger, and mildly grassy prairie sage. The heat and sweetness build into plummy sweet and sour sauce with vague hints of barrel notes. The long finish is unusually spicy."
5332,"<price>500<rating>88<whiskey>Rosebank 1992 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 55.3%<review>Distilled in 1992, a year before Rosebank fell silent, this 21 year old expression was matured in refill American oak casks. 4,530 bottles have been released. The fragrant nose yields milk chocolate, peaches, apricots, nutmeg, and toffee bonbons. Spicy and mildly herbal on the palate, with icing sugar and a suggestion of dark chocolate. The finish is medium in length, fruity, with gentle spice, coffee, and developing oaky dryness."
5333,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Laphroaig Triple Wood, 48%<review>Similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask, but also finished in oloroso sherry casks. Fruit and smoke: fleshy red berries, red licorice, toffee, ripe barley, coal tar, sun-baked seaweed, peat smoke, and a hint of coffee grounds. Tarry finish. I rated the Quarter Cask a 91, and I think this whisky is similar in quality. If you like sherry-influenced whiskies, then go for the Triple Wood. If not, then consider the Quarter Cask. (Travel Retail and European exclusive)"
5334,"<price>42<rating>93<whiskey>Four Roses Single Barrel (Barrel #29-50), 50%<review>This big, sweet, warming bourbon strikes all the right chords. Sizzling sweet corn meets generous oak, like dusty old books, but the bright peach nectar, wet walnuts, and vibrant spice beam through in abundance. Unctuous and concentrated on the palate, it evokes cinnamon-dusted peach pie, with hints of clove and pepper on the finish. A solid and seamless whiskey, with fruit, floral, oak, and spice in perfect harmony."
5335,"<price>27<rating>80<whiskey>Armorik Original Edition, 40%<review>There are big similarities with this whisky and those being produced at nearby Glann ar Mor. The dominant flavors are soft and sweet, and there's a distinctly soft and feminine side to this single malt, which skips across the palate. There are floral and green fruit notes here, traces of oak, barley, and sweet spice, all very ordered. Not complicated maybe, but very well made indeed.  €20"
5336,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Syndicate 58/6 12 year old, 40%<review>Bold, forward flavors on the nose, with spiced stewed apple, nutmeg, dunnage floors, and a waft of grilled mushroom, settling down to peeled cooking apples and sour plum candy. Spices run through a malty palate of fudge, cooked apple, cinnamon, and butterscotch, with grain notes, oat bars, and a hint of chocolate nibs. A little reticent at first, but it’s worth persevering to get better acquainted with this dram. (2,400 bottles)"
5337,"<price>191<rating>93<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange Masterpieces Range 18 year old 1990 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 61.6%<review>Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather, they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil, but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue, backed up with mango and violet, then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish."
5338,"<price>250<rating>85<whiskey>Tullibardine 25 year old, 43%<review>The oldest expression in the Tullibardine lineup provides malt, cedar, stewed apples, and wood shavings on the nose. Mouth-coating, with orange and cocoa powder. Dries quite steadily, with oak lurking behind ripe bananas in the lengthy finish. Another very accomplished old Tullibardine, but the notably pleasing palate of the 20 year old just gives that bottling the edge. "
5339,"<price>125<rating>91<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Confiscated Straight Bourbon, 48.2%<review>The nose is spiced—cinnamon, allspice, clove, pepper—and rich with cooked fruit—blueberry jam, stewed plums, pomegranate molasses—as well as roasted peanuts, vanilla, and oak. In the mouth, there’s more liveliness, with Big Red gum, cherry pie, blackberry cobbler, peanuts, and cinnamon-apple coffee cake. It wraps up beautifully, with chili-chocolate, roasted nuts, and cigar end. Kentucky Owl doesn’t disclose the ages of the bourbons used in this bottling, but the balance of maturity on the nose and verve on the palate work to excellent effect."
5340,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Lot No. 40 11 year old cask strength, 58.4%<review>Vanilla, honey, and caramel accented by baking spices and dark fruits on a complex nose. Water opens up a blisteringly spicy palate, revealing gorgeous clean grains, dusty rye, and citrus hints hidden underneath. Not as floral as earlier iterations, and with fewer typical sour rye notes. Baking spices dominate the vanilla-sweet palate, which finishes with sweet peppery spiciness. Perfect for cask-strength fanatics with patience and an eyedropper. C$100"
5341,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Bladnoch Samsara, 46.7%<review>Samsara is a combination of 8 to 10 year old whiskies matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and California red wine hogsheads, bottled non-chill filtered. Initially slightly savory on the nose, then peaches and cream, and soft spices. The palate is supple and sweet, with vanilla, mango, and passion fruit. The finish is long, with spicy pears. Drier spices emerge and ultimately, light tannins. The red wine influence is greatly enhanced by the addition of a few drops of water. £60"
5342,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Auchentoshan Three Wood, 48%<review>Three Wood has been a key part of Auchentoshan’s portfolio since 2002. It was matured in bourbon, then finished in oloroso and Pedro Ximénez casks. Orange peel, dried apricots, milk chocolate, and fresh-sawn oak on the nose. Toffee, stewed fruits, sherry, cinnamon, and wood spice on the palate. The finish is quite long, with malt, oak, and dark chocolate."
5343,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Westward American Single Malt, 45%<review>A true American single malt; the impression of new charred barrels distinguishes this from its Old World counterparts, while the creamed honey, caramel, and candied nuts keep the wood in check. On the palate, the wood influence delivers big vanilla and hints of smoky char, coupled with nicely concentrated flavors of Turkey Golden table syrup, fruit, and spice. A nice rendition of New World single malt, showing proof and gusto."
5344,"<price>40<rating>89<whiskey>Daviess County Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 48%<review>A revival brand from Lux Row Distillers’ owner Luxco, and part of a trio that also features a cabernet cask-finished bourbon and another finished in new toasted French oak casks. This one is herbal and earthy on the nose, with a light note of citrus. The palate is delicate, with flavors of vanilla cream, cola, and raspberry. Well-balanced and smooth on the finish, ending with pleasant notes of spice."
5345,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1983 Vintage, 46%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber Aroma: Rich and rather full for Glenlivet, with nuts and fruit, drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. Palate: Rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. Delicate fruit, nuts and spice emerge mid-palate, adding complexity, becoming dry with a long spicy finish"
5346,"<price>129<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Paul John (Batch 1), 55.5%<review>Thick treacle, chocolate glaze, sooty fireplaces, spearmint, coal dust, roasted hazelnut, charcoal logs, and earthen warehouse floors make quite an impression. It’s shot through with mouth-puckering tart juiciness, plum, fig, and smoke, and though it becomes fatter and richer, the ashy core continues to blow until it finishes, leaving behind char and cocoa. Water provokes some juicy apple notes and sweetens the finish, but despite the ABV, you should experience this at cask strength. Ride the bull! (148 bottles) £89"
5347,"<price>899<rating>81<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1962 (Cask #2639), 48.9%<review>More of a reddish hue, but as equally robust as the 1961 (see below). Some baked characters alongside dried cherry and barberry, which shift toward balsamic-like concentration. Hint of black pudding (blood sausage) and bitter chocolate. The palate is tight and tannic, with a hint of smoke and cooked dried fruits. Water loosens the tannic grip, allowing licorice to show. (U.S. exclusive.)"
5348,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2018-01 ""Kathleen’s Batch,"" 63.7%<review>Bright and pronounced caramel in many forms, from rich caramel chews to caramel pudding. Then a spice backbone jumps out, followed by butterscotch, brown sugar, vanilla wafers, jalapeño cornbread, mustard seeds, and peach cobbler. A drop of water makes it even more complex with savory spices—sage, dried parsley, and a hint of rosemary, meeting sweet: more vanilla and butterscotch. With or without water, it finishes long and strong with a hint of pepper."
5349,"<price>300<rating>93<whiskey>Cragganmore, 29 year old, 52.9%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Shimmering gold Aroma: Very complex, with a potpourri of spicy, herbal notes. There’s a lot going on here. Nice depth too. Palate: Similar to its aroma, nicely balanced, and evolving. Lingering, spicy finish. 
"
5350,"<price>98<rating>84<whiskey>Port Charlotte 2007 CC:01, 57.8%<review>An immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise), and it is this green, celery-accented element playing off some oily, nutty, and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. Water reveals its youth, but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate, where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. Keenly priced. Worth a look next time you are flying. (Travel Retail exclusive) £68"
5351,"<price>40<rating>78<whiskey>The Arran Malt, 43%<review>Bright gold color. Sweet pear, caramel apples, vanilla, and fudge on the nose. Light to medium in body. On the palate, there is more fruit (pear, citrus) and sweet malt (vanilla, caramel, and toffee), with a gently sweet finish.
   Style: Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $30s. Available nationwide. 
   Again there is no age statement, and this one is still on the youthful side, but it is richer (some sherry cask aging in the mix?) and expresses more flavors-and deeper flavors-than the one mentioned above. It is still quite young, but it tastes more mature than its age (which is probably six years at the most). There's not much Island character here. "
5352,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Edradour, cask #06/538/4, 1996 vintage, 11 year old, 57.5%<review>A “straight from the cask” bottling, finished in a Grand Arôme rum barrel. I can really pick up the rum. If you’ve ever had rum from La Reunion island (easiest to find in France), you immediately pick it out here. Peculiar straw gold/lime green color. Intriguing on the palate, too: botanicals, fennel, liqueur-ish, honeyed malt, red licorice, and tropical fruit. Sort of like a cross between a scotch and something Benedictine monks would make. A nice change of pace. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)

5353,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Jacob’s Pardon 8 year old Small Batch American Whiskey (Batch 01), 48.6%<review>
This first release in a series combines 15 year old light whiskey and 8 year old Tennessee whiskey. Vanilla cake, honeyed almonds, and butterscotch on the nose balance against notes of antique shop, dried leaves, and undertones of herbs and barrel char. A creamy palate brings flavors of spiced chocolate, baked cherries, honeyed almonds, and oak. Crème brûlée on the finish, with baked croissant, buttered almonds, spiced oak tannins, and candied orange."
5354,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>West Cork Glengarriff Series Peat Charred Cask, 43%<review>In one of the year’s most intriguing experimental techniques, Glengarriff treats new barrels with burning peat to imbue a fine veneer of smoke over the surface of the vessel’s virgin oak staves. A final finishing in these smoked barrels imparts the captivating pleasure of chocolate brownie, campfire smoke, and sweet cocoa aromas that yield to a pleasantly oily, rounded whiskey with citrus, Jolly Rancher hard candy, chocolate cake, spices, and coffee notes, with a finish of festive spices. Ambitious work, fresh from the frontiers of flavor. Number 19 in the 2018 Top 20 "
5355,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>anCnoc 12 year old, 43%<review>The entry level anCnoc is aged principally in bourbon barrels, with a small element of sherry wood-matured spirit included in the mix. Floral and quite delicate on the nose, with barley, apples, and honey. Medium-bodied, smooth, and well-balanced, with more honey, apple, malt, vanilla, and cinnamon. The finish is relatively short, drying, and mildly oaky."
5356,"<price>375<rating>77<whiskey>Glenrothes 1996 Editor’s Cask #9973, 57%<review>The second of the duo — destined for the U.S. and Taiwan — is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh Spanish oak sherry hogshead. The combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent. The color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist, behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate, tonka bean, and leather. For me, there’s too much cask and not sufficient Rothes complexities, especially on the palate."
5357,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Filibuster The Boondoggler American Whiskey, 45%<review>Billed as a whiskey that combines elements of bourbon and rye, the nose blends pine forest, lime, green cardamom, coriander, orange, cinnamon, and raisins. The palate is a balance of freshly baked cinnamon buns, chocolate, pistachio, baked apple, cloves, and cracked pepper. The finish is punctuated by sweet vanilla syrup and bitter orange, pipe tobacco, and light pepper. Smooth and pleasant, it perhaps could use more aging, but is well executed nonetheless."
5358,"<price>47<rating>93<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 65.45%<review>The fourth limited release Stagg in as many years. While there’s no age statement on the bottle, this one is 16 years old. And in the same vein as its three predecessors, this Stagg is an extremely seamless affair. What impresses me most about the annual Stagg releases is the whiskey’s incredible drinkability at remarkably high alcohol levels. Be stingy when adding water to this whiskey to appreciate its soothingly smooth, oily texture and lovely notes of maple syrup, vanilla cream, dried corn, candied fruit, polished oak, supple leather, pencil shavings, and subtle mint."
5359,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Day, 56.7%<review>Let it be known that from now on, June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles."
5360,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Sierra Norte Single Barrel Purple Corn, 45%<review>Pepper and allspice light up with savory brisket notes, star anise, a dry nuttiness, and a pile of peanut shells. The flavor slowly comes into focus with stewed apple, red currant, pomegranate, and cranberry, background spices, and late caramel sweetness. The finish has throbbing, gum-tingling heavy clove notes with toffee penny chews and red licorice."
5361,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>Tullibardine 225 Sauternes, 43%<review>Tullibardine 225 Sauternes is finished in Sauternes dessert wine casks from Chateau Suduiraut in Bordeaux, and the nose majors in citrus fruits, vanilla, pepper, and a discreet herbal note. Citrus fruits carry through to the spicy palate, with Jaffa orange to the fore, plus malt. Spicy to the very end, with milk chocolate and a suggestion of passion fruit."
5362,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>West Cork Glengarriff Series Bog Oak Charred Cask, 43%<review>Irish bog oak can lie preserved under the turf for thousands of years. The whiskey’s nose is cool and clean, the smoke refined and rather elegant, with aromas of Brazil nut shells, fine Madagascan chocolate, and dark, unlacquered walking canes. Rich and sweet with chocolate orange, fiery spice, ginger cake, menthol, and root ginger, crumbling into bitter orange peel, bark, molasses, and coffee grounds. Finish of bitter roots and ginger. (4,800 bottles)"
5363,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Eight & Sand Blended Bourbon, 44%<review>A blend of straight bourbons and American whiskeys, all aged at least 4 years, this is fruit cocktail in a glass: cherries, blackberries, wild strawberries, and sweet orange, along with allspice, clove, nutmeg, and a hint of cedar. Sweet, viscous, and full in the mouth, with more fruit (cooked cherry, orange peel, peach), spices, and plenty of oak all the way to the finish."
5364,"<price>41<rating>84<whiskey>Goldlys 14 year old Manzanilla Finish (cask 2629), 43%<review>Other than detecting a note of burst balloons, I enjoyed a warm, rich, comforting nose of nutmeg-sprinkled apple pie, raspberry jam, stewed plums, allspice, and prunes on this whisky distilled at the famous jenever powerhouse of Filliers. A lightweight citrus nose, with vanilla tablet, stewed fruits, watermelon, and a fusty, grained texture. This settles down nicely with a few drops of water for a short finish of light toffee and hints of cocoa. €38"
5365,"<price>140<rating>90<whiskey>Hirsch Rye, 21 year old, 46.5%<review>One of the biggest American whiskeys I’ve tasted. We’re talking heavyweight class here. Notes of thick, chewy toffee and maple syrup are balanced nicely by firm, spicy rye notes, candied fruit, faint dusty corn, and polished oak. The bold spice notes of the rye (and oak) emerge again on the finish. Not as crisp and clean as the Sazerac Rye 18 year old (our Whiskey of the Year for 2005), but it makes up a lot of ground in its lush, decadent, mouth-coating richness. This is a dark, decadent whiskey. My take on the rye whiskey market is that these older expressions are becoming increasingly scarce and more expensive. (No one could have predicted such a demand, or even a category, two decades ago.) If you are a rye whiskey advocate, buy the good ones at the best price you can get.

5366,"<price>89<rating>91<whiskey>Belfour Spirits Texas Pecan Wood-Finished Bourbon, 46%<review>Aged at least 18 months in new charred oak, then finished with Texas pecan wood staves added to the barrel. The nose offers melted caramel, buttered pecan, vanillin, oak, and subtle fruit. A soft palate has notes of baked plum tart, chocolate, figs, allspice, tea leaf, and dusty oak. The finish is spiced, with dark chocolate, light tobacco, and hefty but well-integrated oak. Bold and robust, with an abundance of flavors. (42,000 bottles)"
5367,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Savage & Cooke The Burning Chair Bourbon, 44%<review>Light in aroma, with nougat, pistachio halvah, fresh lilies, and the chalkiness of general store candy. Flavor and mouthfeel are also subtle, sometimes too much so; while there are lovely floral and fruit notes, along with spices, pistachio, toasted grain, and orange oil, a bit more amplitude would go a long way."
5368,"<price>22<rating>89<whiskey>W. L. Weller 12 year old, 45%<review>A “wheated” bourbon, meaning that it doesn’t have the spicy rye notes found in a more traditional “ryed” bourbon. A pleasantly sweet, easy-going, well-balanced experience. Creamy vanilla, caramel, candied corn, and ripe berried fruit , along with more subtle notes of glazed orange, cocoa powder, and wood shavings. If I were going to ease a new bourbon drinker into the category, I might pick this one. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot).

5369,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 12 year old Château Pichon Baron French Oak Cask-Finished, 46%<review>Clean and fresh aromas of raspberry jam and vanilla cream spread thickly on warm scones, speckled with fragrant spices of pepper and grated nutmeg. An instant spicy kick is followed by a flood of warm fruitiness in the mouth, then baked goods and dried citrus. Pepperiness spreads across the tongue, growing dominant over flavors of runny caramel and dried fruits. The finish is slightly drying, spicy, and peppery, with good length. (1,020 bottles)"
5370,"<price>1500<rating>89<whiskey>Bowmore 1964 Vintage Fino Cask, 49.4%<review>Amber-gold color. Exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus, melon, coconut), with interwoven notes of almonds, pear, honey, and subtle peat smoke. Light to medium in body, and very delicate in nature. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet (especially honey), followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma, becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. This Bowmore Fino Cask, a whisky which has aged very well indeed, is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage Bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year. The two to follow in 2003 have been aged in bourbon oak and oloros sherry casks."
5371,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory) 11 year old, 57.6%<review>The nose opens with brine, fresh pine, sage, and sweet antiseptic. Peat, ginger, black pepper, lime, and lemon notes develop in time. Citrus fruits, caramel, and a peat-fueled barbecue on the palate, with background dark berries. The finish is medium in length, warming, and spicy, with plain chocolate and drying, crumbly peat. (Cask no. 13; 275 bottles)"
5372,"<price>170<rating>89<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2014 Release), 59.65%<review>The third cask strength release and, like all Angel’s Envy bourbons, this one is finished in port barrels. When compared to the standard bottling, this cask strength release is packed with more of everything. It’s lush and palate-coating. Fruit forward too, with honey-coated cherries, sultana, ripe peach, pineapple in syrup, peppered with clove and vanilla, and wrapped in a silky smooth finish. This whiskey pushes the envelope of port finishing."
5373,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Millstone 100 Rye, 50%<review>The IMAX of rye. Zuidam Distillers seem to have intensified every aspect of this small batch 100% rye. The plum is fresher, juicier even, the spices more assertive. There’s more creaminess, fruit skin piquancy, slabs of chocolate, allspice, ground cinnamon, and a greater rye character by far. This thumps the tongue hard, delivering quite an experience. In submission, with gums zinging, the unrepentant finish goes on forever."
5374,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon, 50%<review>Sweet fresh corn and fruit—apple skins, white grapes, dried apricot—tangle with spicy cinnamon and circus peanuts. Quite smooth indeed, especially at 50%. Light toasted corn, like corn flakes cereal, with the spice and fruit leading to a subtly layered finish (oak, fruit, a bit of milk chocolate). A late-morning bourbon, easy and friendly."
5375,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Kilbeggan Single Grain, 43%<review>Smooth, delicious, and easygoing, this has sweet cereal and biscuit notes, vanilla, macaroon bars, salt, pepper, and lemon zest on the nose. Sweet caramel, smooth honey, zested mandarin, gentle wood spices, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, mango, guava, and papaya, with a finish of cereal notes and dried tropical fruits. Provenance watchers: Beam Suntory makes grain at Cooley Distillery, and the Kilbeggan name was appended to Irish blends in the past."
5376,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Bruichladdich) 14 year old 1990 Vintage, 58.1%<review>An excellent example of a younger Bruichladdich, and an interesting contrast to the Duncan Taylor expression reviewed above. Appetizing and very clean with a creamy texture. Honey and vanilla notes accentuate a fresh maltiness, with underlying marshmallow, grass and hay. The whisky finishes nicely rounded, pleasingly dry and salty, with a hint of seaweed. A great aperitif."
5377,"<price>50<rating>77<whiskey>Old Forester 1897 Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Screaming oak nose for a relatively young whiskey; about all that’s there is whiskey-soaked staves and some hot spice. Drillingly-hot entry; I’ve tasted bourbons at 60% that were less hot. Roaring oak fire with some underlying corn sweetness; this isn’t subtle or quiet on the tongue. Water brings out more—sweet corn, mint, rye oil—but the oak still dominates. Almost astringent in the finish. If you like big oak, here it is, but forget balance."
5378,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon (2018 Release), 45.7%<review>The nose on this is lovely and seductive, with a gingerbread cookie quality coupled with leather and baking spices. The palate is lively and warming with root beer spices, but its character is overshadowed by the intensity of the toasted barrel, and feels just a bit hollow beneath all that lavish oak."
5379,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Laphroaig 15 year old, 43%<review>Now you see it, now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200th anniversary celebrations, here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode, all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance. And snap it up, who knows when there will be another?"
5380,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Glen Moray 12 year old, 40%<review>Matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. Medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish."
5381,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Two Stars Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 43%<review>Sweet and fruity to start, with Swedish fish, orange Creamsicle, circus peanuts, and some dusty spices: pepper, caraway, and allspice. There’s zippier spice and citrus on the palate, along with chili-chocolate, peanut brittle, cherry cough syrup, and a little leathery oak on the finish. It’s soft and light-bodied—serviceable, but not exciting. (Total Wine & More)"
5382,"<price>335<rating>94<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 23 year old Imperial Single Cask (Distilled in 1997; Cask No. 2798), 45.4%<review>

Spirit, not cask, drives this whisky’s character, with bright notes of lemon and lime, green apple candy, guava, vanilla, and ginger nut cookies creating an inviting and zesty nose. More lemon and lime, plus tangerine, on the palate, along with lively spices—ginger, white pepper, and cinnamon—toasted almonds, baking chocolate, and leather. With water, the profile flips as spices turn savory and chocolate and nuts take on a sweeter tone; the transformation is unexpected, but lovely. Tobacco, coffee bean, and leathery oak on the finish. (144 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5383,"<price>422<rating>88<whiskey>Girvan Patent Still 25 year old, 42%<review>William Grant is making pioneering efforts to develop Girvan as a single grain whisky brand, with more to come. The aromas beckon with masses of buttery vanilla notes, fresh apple, cinnamon stick bundles, dark peel, and chocolate pralines. The creamy, unctuous texture packs in white chocolate, citrus, lime, chewy caramels, and pineapple, with soft American oak characteristics. Long finish of vanilla, ground cinnamon, and mint. One of the tastiest grains on the market: expensive, but still, it’s patently very good. £250"
5384,"<price>210<rating>87<whiskey>Royal Lochnagar 'Selected Reserve,' 43%<review>So nice to see this whisky available here in the U.S. again. A more mature, more sherried expression of the standard Royal Lochnagar. Rich, silky, and sweet, with molasses, nutty toffee, old demerara pot still rum, caramelized fig, marmalade, and juicy oak. More subtle notes of honeyed ginger, coffee grounds, and tobacco leaf add complexity. A soothing post-prandial dram."
5385,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Grand Macnish Black Edition, 40%<review>I am hopeful this blended whisky has benefited from the alligator char treatment to contribute to the deep, rich color and charred smoke notes on the nose. A thick, velvety mouthfeel, with butter toffee, toasted marshmallows going gooey on a stick, great spices, vanilla, whole nutmeg, chicory, and the crust of a well-fired fruit loaf leaving some sooty cinders on the finish. A mighty fireside companion and my favorite Grand Macnish to date."
5386,"<price>53<rating>84<whiskey>Benromach Hermitage 2007, 45%<review>Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. Soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. Rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins."
5387,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Ben Nevis 1998, Duncan Taylor NC2 range, 46%<review>Initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose, with a whiff of sulfur. Then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes, though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. Big and oily in the mouth, with a chewy texture. Oak, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and spices, plus a hint of gunpowder tea. Medium to long in the finish, with more oak, ginger, and quite bitter coffee. A typically ‘off the rails’ independent Ben Nevis. Great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’ "
5388,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan 12 year old Double Cask, 40%<review>This straddles the existing Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges by being a mix of spirit matured in both European and American oak sherry casks. Earthy sherry and old leather on the nose, with toffee, polished oak, and cherry blossom. Medium to full-bodied, with sherry, orange, cocoa, nutty vanilla, and developing wood spices on the honeyed palate. The finish is creamy, with insistent spices, cocoa, and tangy oak."
5389,"<price>900<rating>90<whiskey>Jura 1977 Vintage, 46%<review>This vintage expression from Jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. Just 498 bottles have been released. Apricots, pineapple, caramel, butterscotch, sultanas, and white chocolate on the nose. The palate is warm and spicy, with subtle pine and citrus fruits, along with coconut and a hint of peat. Long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. The delicate peat remains."
5390,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Rye (2016 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 63.1%<review>Distilled in 2010, this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection, and is younger than last year’s release. I feel this is a slight liability, as it comes across a bit green and harsh for a Handy. Bold and spicy, with mint, clove, and cinnamon leading the way. Fig, caramel, and candied fruit round out the palate, but its youthfulness supersedes on the finish. One of the weaker offerings of Handy."
5391,"<price>95<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old, 46%<review>One of the latest batch of single cask bottlings from Wemyss Malts is a 15 year old Clynelish, named ‘Fresh Fruit Sorbet.’ 331 bottles have been released. Tinned pears, new-mown hay, honey, and lemon sherbet on the nose, with a hint of machine oil. The palate is smooth and fruity, with pears, figs, and a suggestion of black pepper. The dominant fruitiness continues through the sugary finish, with a background prickle of spice. £60"
5392,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan Cooper’s Reserve 14 year old, 46%<review>Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, this expression of Auchentoshan was aged for 14 years in a mix of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. It is not chill-filtered prior to bottling. The nose yields polished oak, malt, milk chocolate, marzipan, figs, apricots, and ginger. Rich and full on the palate, spicy, with vanilla, mango, and finally Seville oranges. Medium to long in the finish, with almonds, soft oak, and warming spices."
5393,"<price>47<rating>91<whiskey>Forty Creek Double Barrel Reserve (Lot 252), 40%<review>Finished in wet, freshly dumped bourbon barrels, Double Barrel shows strong bourbonesque vanilla and a slippery, almost syrupy lushness. This latest batch is even creamier than the early ones made by John Hall himself. After a deceptively simple start, a mouth-filling toffee sweetness broadens into ripe tropical fruits with fleeting under-notes reminiscent of earthy dragonfruit. Hot, peppery flares punctuate the soft fruitiness as it moves to the fore and the creamy mouthfeel subsides."
5394,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Signal Hill, 40%<review>Legendary Canadian whisky blender Mike Booth blends small batches within sight of Newfoundland’s Signal Hill, using 95% corn and 5% barley whiskies matured in new oak, bourbon, and Canadian whisky barrels. Golden raisins and dried fruits with brown sugar, maple cream, dark rum, and classic peppery rye spices on the palate. Citrus peel, sandalwood, vanilla, soft oak, and a hint of spice. Rummy throughout with blackstrap molasses tugging on the palate in the finish."
5395,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch, 55.05%<review>The replacement to Four Roses “Mariage” limited editions, which were a marriage of two different whiskey formulas. This new whiskey contains three of Four Roses’ ten different recipes. It tastes older and more mature than the standard Small Batch bottling—there’s a lot more oak dryness and spice, especially on the finish. Along with the oak, there’s plenty of fruit, too (citrus, pineapple, apricot, papaya), plus caramel-coated nuts, a kiss of honeyed vanilla, and complex dried spice (cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon) kicking in on the finish. (Available September, 2010.) "
5396,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Noble Oak Bourbon (prototype), 45%<review>The caramel on the nose is a bit strange and chemical, but the palate offers promise with its pleasing spice, sweetness, orange peel, chocolate, and silky mouthfeel. There are lovely flavors, but the oak feels layered on rather than integrated.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;
Processing: Distilled in Indiana and aged in new charred oak barrels, then put through a finishing process using sherry-seasoned Spanish oak pieces."
5397,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>West Cork Barrel Proof (2018 Release), 62%<review>Uh-oh, here comes trouble. Sourdough, lemon, toffee, creamy vanilla, banana bread, and a few floral notes compete with the intimidating high alcohol. It begins with orange-shred marmalade, fleeting nutty-chocolate notes, and lots of peppery spice before a substantial onslaught of alcohol tramples the taste buds. Sure, it can be tamed with water, but is that really the point? Provocative, hedonistic, raw, and reckless; I’m very glad it’s around. (5,300 bottles)"
5398,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Deerstalker, 18 year old, 46%<review>From the Balmenach distillery. (The previous bottling of this whisky was from a sherry cask. This one is from a bourbon cask.) Mouth-coating in texture. Ripe barley and malty up front, ultimately transitioning to a clinging dryness towards the finish. Notes of vanilla cream, toasted coconut, marshmallow, cut grass, honeydew melon, and lemon/lime. A pleasant, textural whisky. (Bottling at 46% and not chill-filtered enhances this.) My question: why sherry cask or bourbon cask? I think a marriage of both types of cask would add more dimension and complexity."
5399,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Dillon’s Three Oaks, 43%<review>Hail the new distillers who have so broadened the profile of rye whisky. All rye grain, some matured in new American and Canadian oak and some in bourbon barrels, yields a complex palate woven into sweet citrus reminiscent of Grand Marnier. Fresh linen with the waxiness of a wet oil painting, tart gooseberries, creamy vanilla caramels, nutty cereals, and peppery spices. Finishes sweet with ripe fruit, white pepper, and halva."
5400,"<price>119<rating>95<whiskey>Yoichi 15 year old, 45%<review>Nikka’s first distillery is located in the eponymous town on the western coast of Hokkaido. Here, power is the key. Deep and rich with a distinct oiliness — somewhere between linseed and cod liver — there’s also plenty of smoke in the mix as well, and a little hint of black olives in brine with ripe apples lurking behind. I hate making comparisons between Japanese and Scotch single malt but if I was forced to, Yoichi reminds me most of Springbank (edging into Longrow). Water dampens the personality too much for me; best have it full-on and uncompromising.
Rather than the palate showing a slow procession of flavors along the tongue, this is a layered whisky; coal-like, oily, and richly fruited with a distinct saltiness on the sides, ably demonstrating that Japan has almost as much variety on offer as scotch. £76.95."
5401,"<price>26<rating>89<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2002 Vintage, 43.3%<review>Very straightforward and unassuming. Its greatest assets are its balance and drinkability, rather than its flavors. Lovely sweet notes (caramel, vanilla), orchard fruit, golden raisin, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, dusting of cocoa), leading to a smooth finish. Not the most distinctive or complex of the single barrel releases, but just a joy to drink. In fact, this is almost too drinkable. It’s a whiskey I feel would show better at a higher strength (say, 45% or even 50%)."
5402,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Dewar’s 15 year old The Monarch, 40%<review>The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot, honey, vanilla icing, malt bins, Quaker Oats Squares, and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin, brown sugar, vanilla fudge, strands of finely shredded peel, and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions."
5403,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Woodford Reserve 2017 Master’s Collection Cherry Wood Smoked Barley, 45.2%<review>A bourbon made with cherrywood-smoked barley in the mash. When chocolate and cherries meet, instant joy can only be improved with roasted nuts sprinkled on top. That’s what happens here. It’s all there in the opening round, followed by toasted oak, tangerine, pumpkin latte, caramel-covered popcorn, and more cherries, from jam to pitted dark cherries and maraschino to cherry fried pie. If you love cherries, this is a must-have."
5404,"<price>57<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss The Hive 12 year old, 40%<review>Wemyss has picked up where The Easy Drinking Whisky Company left off a few years back and are selling their mix of malt whiskies under a descriptive flavor name. This is the best the company has done so far. It is a delightfully soft, fruity, and dessert-like whisky with, yes, lashings of honeyed malt to make it a soft, succulent treat of a whisky. Wemyss comes of age.  £36"
5405,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Amador Double Barrel Bourbon, 43.4%<review>Sourced bourbon at 3 to 10 years old was dumped and finished in Napa Valley wine barrels. The nose is mostly bourbon—corn, warm meadow, hard candy—with a floater of wine wood; I'm guessing white wine. The flavor is quite woody, but not old wood; fresher, and a bit astringent, overshadowing the whiskey. Not sure the finish does it a favor. Sourced whiskey."
5406,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Dalmore 12 year old Sherry Cask Select, 43%<review>
The nose is rich, with new leather, sultanas, dates, furniture polish, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and cloves. Silky on the palate, mandarin oranges with cream, developing toffee, milky coffee, and milk chocolate. The long finish offers nougat, dark chocolate, licorice, and light spices."
5407,"<price>134<rating>85<whiskey>Clynelish Distillers Edition 1992, 46%<review>This 1992 vintage from Clynelish distillery is part of Diageo’s Distillers Edition range of ‘finished’ single malts, and it underwent a secondary period of maturation in oloroso seco casks prior to bottling. Sweet sherry, honey, and oranges on the nose, with a gentle note of rum and cloves. The palate initially offers vibrant sherry, sultana, and hazelnuts, with developing cloves, angelica, and spices. The finish is medium in length, with a mild note of enduring ginger. £45 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5408,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Seven Stills Fireweed, 59.5%<review>Distilled from an “aggressively hopped” IPA, aged in new charred oak, and finished in Islay scotch casks. Cured and grilled meat on the nose—I’m reminded of Lexington, NC-style barbecue—along with chicory coffee and apple blossom. Hoppy and piney flavors reveal the beer wash and are joined by orange, lemon Pine-Sol, pecans, chocolate, oak, black pepper, and restrained smoke. The finish brings it all in: smoked oak, zingy lemon, bittersweet chocolate, and hops. This whiskey will have its fans and detractors; in context, it offers unique and enjoyable flavors. 396 bottles"
5409,"<price>375<rating>87<whiskey>Balblair 1975, 46%<review>Balblair has followed up the first release of its 1975 vintage bottling with a second, which differs significantly in character, having been matured in American oak sherry casks, whereas the initial release had been aged in Spanish oak sherry casks. Floral, mellow, and slightly oily on the nose, with a savory background and ready-salted crisps. Silky smooth on the palate, with citrus fruit, a hint of wood smoke, coconut, and honey. The finish is spicy, with aniseed and oak."
5410,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Michael Collins 10 Year Old, 40%<review>Don’t remember ever reading that Michael Collins suffered from schizophrenia… This is a bewildering whiskey suffering from an identity crisis; its fruity apple Irish heart wrapped in wood, some peat, and conversely, some sherbet and sugar-coated almonds. It’s not unpleasant — far from it — but the journey from sweet apple to sharp spice is a challenge. Stay with it and ultimately the complexities of the malt win through. "
5411,"<price>15<rating>73<whiskey>Red Neck Riviera 'Southern Style' Blended Whiskey, 49.3%<review>"" Straight from them there oak cask barrels to this here bottle,"" the label reads. Light, gently sweet notes of vanilla and caramel corn are the core of this whiskey. Inter-dispersed notes of mint, charred oak, and candied fruit are also present. The label also states ""Sure enough smooth."" True, I have had harsher whiskeys, but I’ve also had many that were smoother -and within this price range. In fact, there are several bourbon whiskeys on the market at this price that are at least this smooth and with a lot more flavor. 
"
5412,"<price>52<rating>86<whiskey>Wilderness Trail Single Barrel Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel #14D07), 50%<review>It’s all about the grain on the nose: corncob, cooked mash, along with hay and grass, brown sugar, and earthy dried herbs. Chewy tannins overtake more subtle fruit and spice notes in the mouth; add a little water to reveal grape jelly, milk chocolate, and cinnamon candy. An impressive start from this young Kentucky distillery, though the short finish shows it has some developing yet to do. (236 bottles)"
5413,"<price>369<rating>91<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1509, 47.1%<review>This newbie from Balvenie is the worldwide replacement for the market-specific Tun 1401. A larger volume vat (8,000 liters) is now being filled with an equally eclectic mix of casks (42 casks ranging from 1970 to 1992). Deep amber; this has substance but being Balvenie, it’s gentle: orange blossom/Manuka honey edged with spice, marmalade, scented woods, and a little frangipane. The palate shows a supple, rippling power with some apricot, cinnamon, and root ginger. Awfully good. £230"
5414,"<price>8530<rating>94<whiskey>Teeling Vintage Reserve Collection 37 year old, 41.3%<review>

Distilled in 1983, the nose emanates lemon peel, blooming gorse, gooseberry, mint imperials, butter biscuits, sanded oak, florist shop, salted caramel, and violins lying in red velvet cases. Nimble and juicy on the palate, it’s an odyssey through lemon, lychee, and tangy peels, with the acidity of gooseberry riffing off caramels before honeydew, vanilla, and buttery fresh banana mingle in its final throes while it evanesces from the palate.€7,000 "
5415,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Singleton of Glendullan 18 year old, 40%<review>Of the three Singleton bottlings, Dufftown is aimed at European markets, Glen Ord at Asia, and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. Nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!"
5416,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2019 Release), 46%<review>Sweet fruity peat, new leather, cinnamon, and ginger on the nose. Good blend of smoke and sherry on the substantial palate, with peppery red berries, dark chocolate, and peat. The long smoky finish features lively fruit spices. (1,920 bottles in U.S.)"
5417,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Wild Geese Classic Blend, 43%<review>The Wild Geese whiskeys offer much, but seem to lack the conviction to strike out and be bold. Ironically, though this is the one you'd expect to play safest of all, in fact, it's the most interesting of the bunch. There are trademark apple notes, but it flip-flops appealingly. It has a creamy and toffee-ish heart, is full, soft, and sweet, and has some orange fruit, apricot, and peach notes. Not unlike a classy Canadian whisky. "
5418,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Longmorn 16 year old, 48%<review>Having replaced the 16 year old Longmorn with a no age statement Distiller’s Choice, owner Chivas Brothers reintroduced the16 year old. Vanilla, milk chocolate, and honey on the nose, plus quite intense sweet pear and apple notes. More rich fruit notes on the nicely textured palate, with vanilla and milk chocolate carrying over from the nose, plus raisins. The finish is long and silky smooth."
5419,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. Prelude: Courage and Conviction American Single Malt, 46%<review>A limited-release preview of the distillery’s first American single malt label, Courage & Conviction, which will launch in April 2020. Aged at least 3 years in sherry, bourbon, and cuvée wine casks, this whiskey has a malty nose with notes of dried fruit, wood spice, lime, and pineapple. Baked apples, figs, vanilla, and baking spice on the palate, with a honeyed finish of toffee, toasted oak, and almond. A deft balance of barrel influences. (4,200 bottles)"
5420,"<price>125<rating>89<whiskey>Wild Turkey Diamond, 45.5%<review>A marriage of 13 to 16 year old bourbons honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell’s 60 years at Wild Turkey. It is a more conservative Turkey compared to many of the previous limited-edition releases. But still, this is pleasant, with caramel and creamy vanilla intertwined with soft candied orange, cinnamon, polished oak, and a hint of evergreen. Nicely balanced, very approachable, but I would have preferred this at their signature 101 proof for added intensity."
5421,"<price>125<rating>93<whiskey>Amrut Spectrum, 50%<review>Amrut’s chimeric five-wood cask has been one of the greatest whisky innovations of this year. The aromas release Madagascan chocolate, the fruitiness of Panamanian Geisha coffee, a sturdy granite core, new oak extractives, fresh walnuts, wood spices, treacle, and mango peel. Like velvet, the palate develops lush fruits, Gianduja chocolate, rich, dark coffee, nut oils, and oak tannins, before the red juicy fruits soak through the chocolate. Heat, dry spices, and ground coffee finish. Clever concept: a seminal whisky. £100"
5422,"<price>135<rating>92<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old The Lost Blend, 40%<review>Nuts sinking into molten toffee wrapped in pure, sensuous smoke on a foundation of cedarwood, dried fruits, and seasoned oak: as exotic as the box’s interior artwork. Sandy Hyslop’s multi-phasic blend draws on closed distillery Imperial’s trademark fruitiness and peated Caperdonich, while maintaining a steady hand on the balance. Toffee sweetness, mixed peel, pepper, nutmeg, citrus, and smoke. Creamy, satisfying finish with hints of melted chocolate and light smoke. (Travel Retail)"
5423,"<price>189<rating>90<whiskey>WhistlePig The Boss Hog II: The Spirit of Mortimer 13 year old (Barrel #1), 58.9%<review>More Canadian core rye from WhistlePig, this time at full-bore. It’s strong with rye, sweet with melon and dark chocolate notes, but with a wood character like the unfinished inside of an antique oak wardrobe. The antique wood is strong in the mouth, an oddly elegant note, but afterward comes the melon and chocolate, and oily, coiling rye. Interestingly complicated; a bit hard to make friends, but worth the time and effort."
