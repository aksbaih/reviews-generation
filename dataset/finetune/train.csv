0,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #9), 49.3%<review>This latest installment of the Tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old, mature Balvenie, where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin, as there’s an herbal, spiced element. Its textural richness means it is best with water on the side, allowing deep earthy, licorice, and cigar ash tones to develop, along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. (U.S. only.)"
1,"<price>119<rating>89<whiskey>Glenmorangie 18 year old, 43%<review>This is part of the distiller’s Extremely Rare range, and has been matured in bourbon casks for 15 years, before a third is transferred to oloroso sherry casks for 3 years. Dried fruits, icing sugar, honey, lemon cheesecake, and floral aromas on the nutty nose. The palate offers figs, crème brûlée, cinnamon, more honey, and citrus fruit. The finish sees citrus fruit and oak merge nicely."
2,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Dewar’s 12 year old The Ancestor, 40%<review>A straightforward proposition of honey, vanilla sponge cake, barley notes, hints of apple, fresh banana, melon, and bundles of dry straw. It’s a sweetheart: soft vanilla fudge, heather honey, banana-topped banoffee pie, fudge, vanilla sandwich cookies, barley sugar, and lemon peel, with hardly any spice in the early phase. The finish has a snag of pepper at the end, but this is gorgeously tasty, with smooth vanilla fudge all the way."
3,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Seven Stars #3 Phecda, 45%<review>Willingly, we travel further along the Big Dipper with whisky maker Henric Molin. His latest creation exudes rich, dark, chewy toffee, Brazil nut shells, chopped dates, licorice, stone fruits, grilled beef mushrooms, and worked leather. The flavor starts slowly, like trying to ignite a fire of damp twigs. Once established, there is good weight and density, with treacle, dried fig, black cherry, and cinnamon, but the finish diminishes quickly after swallowing, leaving blackened oak and burnt sugar. 795 SEK"
4,"<price>155<rating>83<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glen Grant) 1972 Vintage, 31 year old, 56.1% ABV<review>I don’t normally like to add water to old whiskies, but this one needs a little at this strength. Whether you will like this whisky or not depends on whether you like woody whiskies with lots of sherry, and whether you care at all about recognizing the distillery character. The flavors are nicely balanced, rich, and very soothing in nature, but I struggle to find Glen Grant in here. Ripe fallen fruit, chewy toffee, maple syrup, honey-glazed almonds, damp oak resins-it’s all there, and it’s all balanced and quite entertaining. I personally want to taste the distillery character in my whisky. If that didn’t matter to me, I would have given this whisky a higher score.

5,"<price>36<rating>91<whiskey>Johnnie Walker A Song of Ice, 40.2%<review>This pale gold, limited-edition dram is named in honor of House Stark from the Song of Ice and Fire book series, better known by its television name, Game of Thrones. Designed for Highballs or pouring over ice, it offers a nose of vanilla sponge cake sweetness, dried grasses, green melon, spring blossoms, white pepper, and a faint trace of peppermint. It has a soft, caressing character, with melon, pulpy summer fruits, sour lemon, butterscotch, barley sugar, vanilla caramel, and a later supportive fizzle of spice. It concludes with a finish of sweet vanilla and fruits."
6,"<price>33<rating>85<whiskey>Canadian Club Black Label 8 year old, 40%<review>In the 1980s, when white spirits elbowed whisky aside in the marketplace, unneeded barrels of Canadian Club continued aging. Japanese whisky lovers delighted by the resulting flavor boost demanded a new Japan-only CC. Sweet and hot, the classic pruney, figgy fruitiness of Canadian Club interweaves with new cedar fence posts. Vaguely pulling tannins lend a bitter edge that first amplifies blistering hot pepper, then muffles it into the soothing, glowing warmth of bubbly ginger ale. (Japan only) ¥ 3,375 "
7,"<price>3000<rating>85<whiskey>Littlemill 25 year old Private Cellar Edition, 50.4%<review>This bottling of 1990 whisky from the demolished Littlemill Distillery was initially matured in ten American and European oak casks before being married and finished in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. Boiled fruit sweets, subtle vanilla, red apple peel, and cereal on the nose. The palate is rich, sweet, and full. Intense fruitiness, then fruit spices, hazelnuts, and some oak notes. Very long in the finish, with aniseed and plain chocolate. Mildly tannic at the last. Complex and satisfying. (1,500 bottles)"
8,"<price>80<rating>81<whiskey>Reservoir Wheat Whiskey Year II, Batch 2, 50%<review>Wow, that's a small barrel whiskey! Only 2 years old, and more like 12 years dark, with a nose stuffed full of oak char, steamy mint, and hot vanilla. You know it's wheat in the mouth; despite the aggressive nose and the heat you do get, this is still pretty friendly stuff for 50%: sweet dough, mint, and more oak. But the finish roars in real hot and a bit astringent, ruining the moment, and water doesn't help."
9,"<price>53<rating>89<whiskey>The Lakes The One Signature Blend, 46.6%<review>

Orange segments and grapefruit peel with a spritz of peel oils, accompanied by gentle spice, bakery notes, and fruit-flavored jelly candies. Vanilla, sweet orange, honey, grapefruit peel, peppery spice, and lavender, then baked orange with deeper honey tones. Their first bottling, called The One, in 2014 was poor: this isn’t. Master blender Dhavall Gandhi joined the distillery in 2016 and he has turned this into a terrific dram.£39"
10,"<price>105<rating>89<whiskey>Springbank 11 year old, 58%<review>Finished in a rum cask. Gently sweet (caramel, vanilla cream, kiss of honey), with balancing fruit (lime, kiwi, green grape) and spice (white pepper, brine). Youthful (but not immature). Invigorating briny finish. I don’t know what kind of rum cask was used, but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. Very nice! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) "
11,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Glengoyne 15 year old Distiller’s Gold, 40%<review>Distiller’s Gold is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager, Cochran Cartwright, whose ghost is said to haunt the Stirlingshire distillery. Distiller’s Gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit, with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. Spicy tropical fruits on the palate, with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. Medium in length, pleasantly oaky, persistently nutty and spicy. Price is per liter."
12,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Fukano 12 year old Single Cask (Cask No. 55), 41.8%<review>

Disgorged from a 440-liter new oak cask, this is like a spiced blueberry muffin. The aromas evolve before your very nose; spicy punch, dried conifer cone, dark toffee, cola candy, strawberry laces, baked plum, banana skin, and ground pepper. A light palate, mouth-drawing at times, with pastry, butter croissant, and dried raspberry, developing richer fruits and sweetness, with toffee, black fruits, chewed leather, and base notes of pepper. (420 bottles)—"
13,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Nikka Days, 40%<review>An accomplished blend packed with appealing flavors from Miyagikyo and Yoichi Distilleries. Honey, baked lemon, vanilla essence, brioche, golden syrup, and spring tree blossom aromas, with hints of butterscotch and caramel. Smooth, rich, and rounded, this has toffee, chocolate, red berry fruit, plum, vanilla pod, a touch of oak char, and clipped spices. A flash of peat smoke on the finish, with flavors of burnt sugar, baked fruits, and spices."
14,"<price>130<rating>85<whiskey>The Balvenie Peated Cask 17 year old, 43%<review>The newest release in Balvenie’s limited edition range, and the first venture back into smoke since the “Islay Cask” limited release several years ago. Some of this whisky was finished in a peated cask, some in new American oak. Both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. Spicy, smoky finish. Balvenie is one of those big Speyside whiskies that can stand up to the smoke. This one will not appeal to everyone, but it makes for an interesting diversion."
15,"<price>76<rating>84<whiskey>Highland Queen 12 year old, 40%<review>At this age, there are more linear displays of fruit and sweetness than the 8 year old. Behind the tarte tatin, butterscotch, light pepper, and wood spice is a green, verdant nose of wet foliage and public lawns in the morning mist. It has a light to medium-weight texture of sugary butterscotch, strawberry, and raspberry developing around an oak and malt core. When the fruit flavor withers, there is a drop off in flavor, leaving a malty melee. £48"
16,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s 10 year old Kentucky Straight Rye, 40%<review>Floral notes of violets meet heaps of spices: allspice, cloves, and nutmeg. The oak is right in your face, but not overwrought, woven with vanilla and cedar. The flavor shows good maturity, with leather, lanolin, and wax crayons, before more drying oak and spices bring it to a close. Brings some age to the table, but also feels just a bit tired, perhaps owing partly to the low proof."
17,"<price>175<rating>93<whiskey>Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Cornerstone Kentucky Straight Rye, 54.5%<review>A delightfully complex nose of vanilla, hot cross buns and bakery shop, cherries, coconut, raisins, figs, licorice, old leather, and hay barn. A smooth, viscous palate offers lemon honey, fragrant oak, cigar ash, dark berries, and more coconut. Spicier notes emerge with water, while the finish offers rich smoothness, with spiciness, chocolate-covered coconut, tobacco, and bitter herbs. Lots of depth and complexity. A great whiskey to enjoy with a cigar."
18,"<price>7000<rating>89<whiskey>Last Drop Distillers (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1967, 45.4%<review>This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers, and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style, well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually, it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose, with apples, marzipan, ginger, linseed, and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate, with allspice, before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying, with subtle smoke, and a fatty spice note at the very end."
19,"<price>87<rating>84<whiskey>Teerenpeli Distiller’s Choice Rasi, 43%<review>A Moscatel finish for a year after maturation in bourbon casks has added dark, sweet notes to the whisky’s natural character. This has an attractive nose of red-skinned apples, sweet dark raisins, coconut, nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove. The creamy texture has well-balanced flavors of tangy tropical fruit, Szechuan peppercorns, and a dalliance with citrus. Light, clean, and refreshing through to the finish of spiced apple and pepper. Subtle and careful, this is a restrained example of extra maturation. (2,554 bottles) £60"
20,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Tomintoul 10 year old, 40%<review>The longest-standing expression in the range, 10 year old was introduced in 2002. It offers a nose that is light and initially green, with unripe apples, acetate, ripe pears, bananas, and light fudge. The palate is relatively insubstantial, with nutty milk chocolate, vanilla, brittle toffee, and oak. Nutty in the short finish, with a hint of malt and drying oak."
21,"<price>96<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Malts ‘Honey Spice’ (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 (bottled 2011)<review>Bunnahabhain, along with Bowmore, is Islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of Highland Distillers. Its rich, thick, and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of European oak extremely well. In this red tea-colored example, you have resin, saddle soap, ginseng, and treacle toffee on the nose, and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. A big huggable bear. £60"
22,"<price>58<rating>87<whiskey>Paul John Bold, 46%<review>This new peated expression exhibits the billowing, rich smoke of burning fruitwoods, warm banana-and-honey muffins, and caramelized brown sugar granules seared onto puff pastry. Tasting this evokes spiced apple, cinnamon, and orange peel, with more peat coming through mid-palate, mingled with Brazil nut, menthol, eucalyptus, clove, and peppermint. A warming glow trickles slowly down, leaving hot smoke and menthol behind. With whisky of this quality, master distiller Michael John will only gain further followers of his work. £40"
23,"<price>78<rating>91<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Hvenus Rye, 45.6%<review>Like licking caramel-drizzled mint chocolate chip ice cream; master distiller Henric Molin’s high-rye mashbill delivers a great balance between rye spices and creamy sweetness. Quite soft, with mint and caramel at first; layers of toffee and cinnamon follow, then becoming mouth-drawing as the pepper and clove spices crest a peak of intensity, tapering to toffee and cinnamon, and a dry finish."
24,"<price>22<rating>87<whiskey>MacQueens of Scotland 12 year old, 40%<review>A delicate blend that manages to express richness in its simplicity. Perfumy and floral on the nose. On the palate, coconut, marzipan, and golden raisin flavors show the grain component, but they’re buttressed by chocolate, strawberries, and orange oil, leading into a satisfying oak and chocolate-orange finish.

25,"<price>43<rating>90<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Towiemore, 43%<review>Built between Keith and Dufftown in 1898, but closed at the start of the 30s, Towiemore’s warehouses were still in use until 1993. Fresh peaches and fragrant florals, rich orange, roasted almond chips, and hazelnut. Glenrothes connoisseurs will appreciate this one. Mellow and nutty with a good supple texture; baked peach, dried peel, mango, and light spices, with a candied peel and spice finish."
26,"<price>108<rating>83<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay 4th Edition, 59%<review>A distillate of Islay-grown barley, made in 2009-10 and aged in bourbon wood. Here’s an intense Kilchoman with a licorice root sweetness mixed with dried seaweed, machair (beach pasture), cereal, and herbal smoke. The palate is slightly oily and hot when neat, with a distinct mineral edge. Water shows its youth but also allows tarragon and wormwood to develop. £64"
27,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey>Popcorn Sutton’s Tennessee White Whiskey, 46.5%<review>Clean nose, hard grain, some grassy sweetness, a bit perfumey. Interesting on the tongue: grain, sweet orange, and meadow grass; has a pleasantly creamy texture. Gets just a bit solvent-touched at the finish, but overall, an interesting sip…which brings up the question again: what are these ‘white whiskeys’ for? Cocktails, highballs, neat sipping? This one, I think, could pull off all three, the kind of white whiskey that compares to white rum. Sourced whiskey."
28,"<price>165<rating>91<whiskey>Blackadder 11 year old Raw Cask Balmenach 2008 Single Cask (Cask No. 14), 58.5%<review>Charred oak meets grape jelly, with aromas of crushed almonds, dried blueberries, new car leather, dark chocolate-covered raisins, and a whole lot of vanilla. In the mouth it’s chewy and well-textured; add water and it turns velvety. The water brings out better balance as well, tempering the very active cask and buttressing berry, orange, cinnamon-chocolate, and espresso bean. More coffee bean, cinnamon-dusted pecans, dark chocolate, raspberry coulis, and hints of tobacco on the finish. A scotch for bourbon lovers. (268 bottles; 90 for U.S.)"
29,"<price>420<rating>92<whiskey>Bruichladdich 26 year old Black Art 1990 (Edition 06.1), 46.9%<review>Tangerines on the nose, then Turkish Delight, sliced cucumber, new leather, toffee, soft spices, and a hint of char. Mouth-coating, with sweet orchard fruits dipped in cream. Sharper fruit notes in time, with almonds and ginger. Icing sugar, milk chocolate, spicy oak, a fleeting savory note, and lingering fruitiness in the finish. Shows well-integrated character. (18,000 bottles) Collectibles"
30,"<price>170<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 29 year old Rare Auld Grain 1989 (distilled at Strathclyde), 53%<review>Here’s a grain that mellowed as it matured, wrapping itself in the wood while retaining its distinctive character. Nectarine, cilantro stalks, celery tops, gently herbal, candied lemon slices, and Jaffa cakes on the nose. Warm buttery flavors initially, with citrus, herbal notes, and energetic spices leading to a finish of soft ripe fruits and cinnamon. Really worth the experience; try playing with the dilution to control the spiciness."
31,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Arran Single Malt, 46%<review>Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt scotch Color: Straw Gold Aroma: Youthful. Pears in syrup, honeysuckle, and vanilla with a hint of caramel and citrus. Palate: Vibrant, somewhat youthful flavors that echo its aroma, finishing slightly sweet and a little fiery (because of its age). General Comments: The lack of chill-filtering certainly makes this whisky more flavorful and dynamic than its filtered brethren. It also tastes a little more mature. This shows how a whisky can be affected by chill-filtering. I expect this whisky to continue improving with additional aging. Available nationwide."
32,"<price>145<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Scotia 21 year old, 46%<review>The nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish. "
33,"<price>34<rating>85<whiskey>Gun Fighter Double Cask Rye, 50%<review>Orange, mango, strawberry candy, and licorice on the nose, while water brings out watermelon, more mango, and a soft wood note. A light palate offers fruitcake, orange, blackberry, chocolate, almond, gingersnaps, tobacco, and cedar spice. A finish of vanilla, orange, and more tobacco, with water bringing out hot chocolate, orange, burnt espresso beans, and drying oak. Orangey and tropical at the outset, but also deep and nutty, particularly on the finish."
34,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2019-04 “Beaten Biscuits” Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 63.05%<review>Fragrant oak on the nose, along with powdered sugar, vanilla fudge, cherry pie, and accents of orange peel and leather. The palate offers notes of orange Creamsicle, pepper, dried oranges, and cigar wrapper. The finish is a long ride of spice and chocolate-covered almonds, melding with cooked fruit notes of orange and black cherry, as well as cracked pepper. A robust whiskey that carries its heft gracefully, and offers balanced complexity."
35,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Mars Iwai, 40%<review>The original Iwai pot stills from the 1960s have been retired and now stand outside the Mars Shinshu Distillery. Cajoled by the savory, almost gamey aromas assimilated with brown apple and old strawberries, the whisky is surprisingly candy sweet to the taste. Dark jellied fruits: first Rowntree’s Fruit Gums, then Fruit Pastilles. Hazelnut, gentle oriental spices, and chicory coffee usher in a deep, fruity finish with creamy chocolate and fresh mint."
36,"<price>201<rating>80<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Mortlach) 1989, 55.8%<review>There’s a Roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk, and this is it in alcohol form. A slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. There’s a hit of pencil shavings, but with water it becomes cheesy. So much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight, like an old Vin Jaune. It finishes with earthy tones. It’s just…odd. £125"
37,"<price>250<rating>78<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage (distilled Fall 1990) 24 year old, 50%<review>Non-chill filtered plus a lot of age equals oak meeting caramel, vanilla, earth, nuttiness, and mildew. Slight hints of anise, rose petals, tree bark, and overcooked rice, before over-oaked flavor dominates with medicinal notes and soap. Bitterness, earth, and a saving grace of herbs follow for a decent, albeit woody finish. This is simply over-oaked. I’d love to have tasted this bottled three to seven years ago."
38,"<price>36<rating>90<whiskey>Drambuie, 40%<review>Intriguing herbal/medicinal nose, with notes of pepper, grass, dried hay, dried flowers, orange peel, and licorice. Sweet but lively and light on the palate, as the orange explodes and the whisky boldly appears, wrapped in honey and herbs. The finish is herbal and sweet as the whisky strolls off into the distance. Overall, quite complex and rewarding."
39,"<price>280<rating>86<whiskey>Chieftain’s (distilled at Port Ellen), 1982 vintage, 25 year old, 43%<review>Port Ellen whiskies are getting pretty rare (and expensive). This one is softer and less vibrant than others that I’ve tasted, but still very much Port Ellen, and still enjoyable! Notes of coal tar, rooty licorice, toffee, dark chocolate, and nougat, with background citrus gumdrops, ginger, brine, seaweed, peat bog, and damp oak. I think bottling this at 46% without chill-filtering, or perhaps even cask-strength, would have helped the flavors “zing"" (and elevated my rating)."
40,"<price>294<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan 18 year old Sherry Oak (2017 Edition), 43%<review>The latest annual limited release is classic and sure to please true aficionados of Macallan. Stewed fruit and old leather on the nose, along with ripe cherries, gingersnaps, and black pepper, before orange marmalade notes develop. Full-bodied, with fragrant sweet orange, milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight, and faint smoke. The finish yields dark chocolate, cherry liqueur, and more pepper. Long and spicy."
41,"<price>130<rating>93<whiskey>Balcones Brujeria Sherry Cask-Finished Single Malt (Batch 18-1), 62.9%<review>The oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks that this whiskey was finished in present themselves right up front, with raisins, dried figs, marmalade, blackcurrants, leather, cinnamon, allspice, and dried chile on the nose. The full, somewhat tannic palate is savory and sweet all at once, juxtaposing dark fruit, ample spice, figs, raisins, and marmalade with hazelnuts, almonds, mole sauce, and tobacco. Transitioning into the finish, peppery spice, dried fruit, dark chocolate, mocha, cigar, and rich oak highlight the finesse and balance this whiskey pulls off with aplomb."
42,"<price>135<rating>93<whiskey>Macallan 15 year old Double Cask, 43%<review>

The iconic producer of lush sherried malts delivers again. Employing the same technique of marrying whiskies aged in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak that landed the 12 year old in our 2017 Top 20 has resulted in a truly decadent dram—richly nutty and fruity, with dried apples, cherries, and prunes. The palate is wonderfully luscious, supple, and chewy, delivering mouth-coating waves of fruit that remain for minutes on end, before a long farewell of lingering, warming spice. Impressive and irresistibly good. Number 16 in the 2020 Top 20"
43,"<price>56<rating>80<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic, 40%<review>The onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. The nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice, even a sprig of mint. Fresh, but with a background funkiness. In time, there’s ripe melon, then lightly musty wood comes through. The palate is light, giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. It’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25"
44,"<price>400<rating>90<whiskey>St. George XXX Anniversary Malt, 46%<review>Some of the oldest American malt whiskey joins this 30th anniversary mingling, finished in a pear eau de vie barrel, a nod to the distillery’s origins. The nose is elegant, deep, and clearly touched by the pear and oak. There’s creaminess in the mouth, a perfect weight, rich nutty sweetness balanced by wood; it all slides into a warming finish, and pear is all around. A bit too much pear, actually; though I love pears, that’s my one complaint."
45,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Warehouse C Tornado Surviving, 50%<review>The third Taylor release, and the gentlest, most even-keeled of the three. Black raspberry, mulberry, maple syrup, oak resin, dates, soft leather, and spice (mint, cinnamon, clove, vanilla) round out the palate. Very drinkable for 100 proof, and with plenty of character."
46,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Trader Joe’s Glen Moray 16 year old Speyside (Distilled in 2001), 40%<review>Layers of rich fruit pervade the nose—plums in syrup, mango, guava, peach, dried kiwi—along with white pepper, ginger, and tobacco leaf. Those same fruits tumble over each other on the palate, which is light but complex, with gentle spice, cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, and slightly drying oak. The finish, though light, retains length through chocolate, tobacco, and polished oak flavors. This tastes remarkably good at its low proof, but what a thing it would be at 46%. (Trader Joe’s)"
47,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve Small Batch (Lot 1867 L), 40%<review>A complex nose with citrus fruits, hints of sultanas, barrel tones, mild vanilla, butterscotch, and manuka honey. The sweetish palate is rich in stone fruits—peaches and apricots that merge into a vaguely pithy nuttiness, then dried Mediterranean fruits: dates and figs. Classic slippery corn sweetness complements hot, sweet rye spices. Ends in a medium, vaguely oaky, smoky finish."
48,"<price>55<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie 14 year old Quinta Ruban, 46%<review>This Quinta Ruban succeeds the 12 year old version, adding two additional years of finishing in port casks, while maintaining the same bargain price. The result is a symphony of understated opulence. Marzipan, fresh apple and pear, milk chocolate, red berries, candied ginger, and praline on the nose build slowly, leading into a fruity, spiced palate. Flavors of soft gingerbread, molasses cake, cherry pie, spiced plums, almond nougat, and dark chocolate intermingle with faint strains of pipe tobacco. It sings on the finish, with a parting crescendo of hazelnut, spice, cigar wrapper, and lengthy oak. Number 9 in the 2019 Top 20"
49,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky, 12 year old, 40%<review>Lovely balance on the nose and palate. Soft and gently textured, too. The sweetness of the whisky (honey, fruit gum drops, and malty vanilla), dovetail nicely with light, bright citrus and teasing dried spices. Heather/floral notes enhance the whisky’s complexity. Clean, delicately polished oak finish. A very versatile, inexpensive, easy-drinking whisky.

50,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Glenmorangie Original, 43%<review>Original is eager to please, yet not lacking complexity. A soft nose features honey, vanilla, sweet orange, and caramel. Hazelnuts dipped in honey and more orange, along with red apples on the rounded, buttery palate. Vanilla and cocoa powder in the lightly spiced finish, which boasts just a hint of smoke."
51,"<price>2500<rating>93<whiskey>Teeling Vintage Reserve 29 year old Single Malt PX Finish, 46%<review>Lean green fruits and dry spices, with fresh Comice pear, honeydew melon, lychee, toasted sesame, cardamom, banoffee pie, creamy vanilla, and delicate, perfumed florals. The PX has framed this beautifully with flavors of sultana, shortbread, apple, pear, clove, and black pepper, with the orchard fruits and spices fading into the finish. This has aged gracefully and shows the great potential for long-aged Irish whiskeys. (100 bottles, U.S. exclusive)"
52,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #258), 40%<review>Brenne is from the Cognac region of France and is becoming an American success story, having been launched stateside by Allison Patel, but little known elsewhere. After 6 years in French oak, 2 years in a Cognac barrel, and reduced by the local water to 40%, the result is a delicate, almost floral, eucalyptus and rosewater delight, with honeycomb and sweet spice. Very different from a standard malt, but very good all the same."
53,"<price>42<rating>88<whiskey>Woodinville Straight 100% Rye, 45%<review>Peach, blueberry, candied raspberry, and lime lead the way, with marzipan and a background of peppery spice aromas set artfully against soft, subtle wood. A mouth-filling palate offers lemon and raspberry, along with ginger, cinnamon, chocolate, and honey. Water coaxes tropical notes of melon and pineapple. The finish is peppery, with caramel and chocolate flowing over pleasant oak overtones. A rye that strikes an excellent balance between fruit, sweetness, and spice."
54,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Tamdhu Batch Strength (#004), 57.8%<review>Aromas of newsprint, damp foliage, and wood spice dominate on the nose. Confident, almost fizzy sherry notes on the full palate, with sultanas, figs, and fruit spices. It becomes progressively more citric. The lengthy finish produces dark chocolate dipped in chili sauce. A sherry-soaked dram."
55,"<price>275<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla), 1963, 40%<review>Some of these old G&M Strathisla whiskies are quite lovely, and this is one of them. It’s gently sherried, soothingly oily in texture, and complex, with notes of maple syrup, candied fruit, plum, roasted nuts, polished leather, and old oak, along with some damp earth, coffee bean, cinnamon, mint, and subtle, teasing kiln smoke. It’s soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. If you like old, sherried Speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried, you’ll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). It would give the whisky a little more backbone, and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s.

56,"<price>65<rating>95<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 70.7%<review>Like the William Larue Weller releases a couple years back, I felt that the Stagg releases (after being brought down in strength) were almost too easy-going. Like the new Weller release, this bourbon has improved greatly, to classic status. Clean, balanced notes of toffee, molasses, nougat, polished leather, dates, roasted nuts, cinnamon, subtle summer fruits, teasing mint, ground coffee, nutmeg, and a hint of tobacco. Long, balanced finish. An outstanding bourbon!"
57,"<price>89<rating>83<whiskey>Glenlivet Nadurra Islay Cask, 61.5%<review>The aim here was to recreate the style of malt made by George Smith, but rather than running peated malt, Chivas Bros. has aged the spirit in Islay casks (not what George would have done). On the upside, this is a classic Nadurra: estery fruits with pineapple to the fore, freesia, pear, and fresh apple, the smoke giving subtle gun-flint notes to the palate. I like it as a dram, but it’s wimped out of what was intended. Marked accordingly."
58,"<price>20<rating>82<whiskey>Wild Turkey 81, 40.5%<review>Comprised of bourbon aged 6 to 8 years old (and seems closer to 6 than 8). This new, fairly bold for 81 proof whiskey, while drinkable neat or with a splash of water, really works best as a mixer. Very traditional bourbon notes of caramel, vanilla, mint, cinnamon, sweet corn, and orchard fruit."
59,"<price>107<rating>86<whiskey>Southern Coast Malt Cask 5, 46%<review>I'm not sure that if you loved Cask 4 you'd be so pleased with Cask 5, because it's completely different. This has the shadow of Bill Lark all over it, with big, over-cooked red apple flavors combining with walnut oil, orange liqueur, treacle toffee, stewed berries, and some oaky astringency. It's rich, full, complex, and a grower — and I can feel a new love affair starting right here. A$110"
60,"<price>240<rating>94<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 21 year old Ardmore 1998 Single Cask (Cask No. 750753), 50.2%<review>Exhibit A for never judging a whisky by its color: This straw-pale malt shows depth and complexity many sherry-dark whiskies would envy. The nose is briny and smoky, with a seaweed character; lemon poppyseed muffin and almond cake are present without water. Add a few drops, however, and fresh orchard fruit emerges, sweet and clean, and carries into the rounded, silky palate where it mingles with salt water, black pepper, a squeeze of lemon, and smoky peat. Good length on the finish, which has oak, nuts, and cigar wrapper. A paragon of balance. (240 bottles)"
61,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts Blend of Malts 20 year old 1994, 50%<review>Whiskies from undisclosed Speyside and Highland distilleries are blended together in first-fill sherry butts. On the nose it’s an alluring blend of orange, cherry, toffee, salt, and ginger. The entry follows the nose with toffee, orange, ginger, and malt. Things begin to drop off in the mid-palate, which is very focused on salt and ginger, with strong alcohol undertones. The alcohol drives and defines a dry finish that's absent of much of what's so alluring about this whisky. (U.S. only)"
62,"<price>8000<rating>90<whiskey>The Dalmore 1979 33 year old, 48.5%<review>This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. Full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles."
63,"<price>35<rating>80<whiskey>High West American Prairie Bourbon (Batch #16B16), 46%<review>A blend of straight bourbons. Light straw color. An expressive dark cherry, cooked grains, and wood nose opens up to a bevy of custard, roasted pine nuts, and herbs, with hints of tobacco and smoked hazelnuts. A grain-forward approach leaves it slightly unbalanced, until roasted nuts save the day with a tinge of vanilla and caramel-flavored popcorn. Sourced whiskey."
64,"<price>98<rating>84<whiskey>Mackmyra Special Number 07, 45.8%<review>The Mackmyra success story just goes on and on. There have now been more Specials than bottlings of Privus or Preludium, and the whisky makers seem to have hit upon a trademark taste that they tweak with each bottling. It's a mix of salt, pepper, citrus, and vanilla, and here the vanilla is at its most subdued and the salt is at its highest. That makes this challenging to anyone unfamiliar with the Mackmyra brand. SEK 649"
65,"<price>140<rating>93<whiskey>Four Roses Small Batch 130th Anniversary Edition, 54.15%<review>A beguiling nose balances maturity and freshness, with charred oak, caramelized sugar, blackberry pie filling, floral notes, and toasted almond evolving in deep layers. The concentration on the palate is jaw-dropping—so much richness, power, and grace, as flavors flit across the tongue. Robust and drinkable, the fruity pie filling turns to candied orange peel and buckwheat honey before a licorice-laced finish. (13,140 bottles) Collectible"
66,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Glengoyne Cask Strength (Batch #006), 59.8%<review>This was matured entirely in sherry wood. Blackcurrants, black pepper, vanilla, caramel, and fruit spices on the nose. Supple on the malty palate, with red berry fruits, nutty sherry, and almonds. The finish is spicy, with black tea and firm oak."
67,"<price>121<rating>85<whiskey>Nant Single Malt, 43%<review>This is a creamy, rich, refreshing departure from the more common styles of Australian whisky and it's ample proof that diversity will be a major part of the Oz story. This is milky chocolate and cocoa, almost like cachaça, with some soft violet and red wine notes, and—somewhat bizarrely—black currant sorbet. As I said about shouting Aussies above, this is anything but; a delicate, light-fingered exercise in style. A$125"
68,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Oola Discourse Three Shores Whiskey Black Label French Oak, Cabernet Barrel Finished, 47%<review>A blend of Highlands scotch, Canadian whisky, and high-rye whiskey from Seattle’s Oola Distillery, with an additional year of aging in cabernet sauvignon barrels. The wine influence is apparent, with plum, cherry, and raspberry on the nose. French vanilla, dusty oak, white chocolate, and stone fruit dominate a creamy and mellow palate. Poached pears, honey, and cornbread flavors bring a little too much sweetness and lack depth."
69,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Hazelburn 10 year old, 46%<review>This expression from Springbank Distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling. It is unpeated, distilled three times, and matured in bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is gently floral, with pears, toffee, and soft oak, then emerging herbal tobacco notes. The palate is full and slightly oily, with cream, orchard fruits, cinnamon, and sea salt. The finish is long, with vanilla and cocoa powder."
70,"<price>108<rating>81<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 1992, 50.2%<review>Not often seen as a single bottling, here we have Speyside’s modernist distillery in typically delicate guise, with plenty of subtle florals (think hyacinth and daffodils), something which is amplified with water. Imagine a cool day in early spring and you are pretty much there. The mouth is clean and fresh, with a little acidity. Water doesn’t damage the palate delivery, but neither does it particularly enhance things. A sorbet rather than a meal. £65"
71,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Blackadder Raw Cask (distilled at Edradour), 1976, 49.4%<review>Gold color. Aromas of toffee, nuts, and a hint of mint. Medium in body, with a malty, coating texture. The flavors evolve on the palate, with toffee up front, malty sweetness in the middle and nutty, finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla. 
"
72,"<price>24<rating>79<whiskey>Copper Fox Single Malt Spirit, 62%<review>The malt was “lightly smoked” with a 60/40 mix of apple and cherry woods. It is very light in the nose, which gives a fruitbowl—apple, white grape, pear—topped with wet malt, and just a hint of that smoke. Very hot, as expected, but the smoke is more pronounced, with a creamy texture. Water brings out more malt, and notes of cocoa, ripe Red Delicious apple, and nuts…and a somewhat rough finish. Interesting, and mixable."
73,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Booker’s 2017-02 “Blue Knights Batch,” 63.7%<review>Think corn: roasted, canned, creamed, mashed, pan-fried, in salsa, and in bread. The corn pops early and often. This complements hazelnut, caramel pudding, and baking spices. A drop of water really opens this up, softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices. Even the finish is better with water. Perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof."
74,"<price>101<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchentoshan) Batch 2, 46.6%<review>Batch 2 runs to 295 bottles and, in common with the rest of the range, carries no age statement. Peaches in brandy, ginger, honey, and milk chocolate on the pleasingly floral nose. The palate is silky, with more floral notes, plus cedar, oak, and soft spices. Almonds and allspice in the medium length finish. £63/500 ml"
75,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Company Phifer Pavitt Reserve, 53.5%<review>Aromas of oak, dried fruit, and horse saddle set up for a sucker punch of leather boxing glove from this big and brawny bourbon. But it also dances with grace, tickling the tongue with sweet spices, dark bitter chocolate, and wisps of tobacco. Intriguing notes of horehound, cocoa-dusted almonds, and baked apples are lip-smacking good, and it handles water well, revealing ever more depth."
76,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 18 year old, 46%<review>Nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. The sherry influence here is complementary, but not overpowering. Notes of toffee almond, vanilla fudge, chocolate-coated citrus, bramble, and candied ginger. Polished leather, dried spice, and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. Not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s Springers, but it’s smooth, well-rounded, and more-ish."
77,"<price>62<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney WK217, 46%<review>WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally, milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)"
78,"<price>45<rating>80<whiskey>Breakout Premium Rye Whiskey, 43%<review>Interesting: “Bottled by The Tennessee Spirits Company, Pewaukee, WI.” Woody nose, spiked with dry rye spiciness: black pepper, dried mint. My, that’s hot. It’s a rye rocket, and the wood’s drying up every bit of sweet here, leaving my tongue wrinkly. A bit of water, though, and this is a much happier whiskey; softer, sweeter notes come out, and the mint cheers up. (sourced whiskey) "
79,"<price>330<rating>91<whiskey>Bruichladdich Black Art 05.1 1992, 48.4%<review>As ever, the composition of Black Art is a closely guarded secret, and this is distiller Adam Hannett’s first such assembly. Rich aromas of fig, succulent autumn berries, sherry, cream, and malt feature on the complex, floral nose. Viscous on the palate, which opens dry, with developing berry fruits and spicy oak, plus dried fruits and candied peel. Long and drying in the finish, with plum and peppery oak."
80,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Old Forester 1870 Original Batch, 45%<review>The first release in the “Whiskey Row” series. Nicely balanced flavors with a youthful kick. Fairly straightforward in profile, with plenty of spice (cinnamon, clove, mint, and nutmeg), citrus fruit (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), and honey vanilla. Dry, spicy finish. A little rough around the edges, but otherwise an enjoyable whiskey."
81,"<price>23<rating>83<whiskey>Wild Turkey Rye, 40.5%<review>The follow-up to 81 proof Wild Turkey bourbon—and part of a continuing trend by distillers to release versatile whiskey: reasonably priced, no age statement, that will stand out in cocktails but can be enjoyed on its own in a pinch. Very spicy, yet relatively soft in character, with suggestions of gin botanicals, dried fruits, honeyed vanilla, and teasing charred oak. Very quaffable for a rye whiskey. "
82,"<price>25<rating>94<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1996 Vintage, 43.3%<review>The 11th annual vintage release of Evan Williams and, judging by the taste of this bourbon, there’s no shortage of excellent bourbon to bottle. This is a rich, seductive bourbon. Sticky toffee, maple syrup, and vanilla cream notes up front are followed by candied fruit, refreshing mint, and spicy cinnamon. Dry, resinous oak finish. Kentucky’s answer to a beautifully sherried Speyside single malt scotch. Outstanding!"
83,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 10 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 2008 (distilled at Aultmore), 53%<review>A rich, fruity nose of baked apple, fruitcake, sliced almond, honey, and white pepper. At cask strength this is quite a bumpy ride, with warm apple, sultana, and caramel revving up to a jagged peak of ginger, pepper, and clove. When your taste buds emerge on the other side, it settles into a more pleasing caramel and toffee sweetness. Perfect for armchair mountaineers."
84,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Little Book Chapter 2 “Noe Simple Task,” 59.4%<review>A fascinating flurry of aromas—red fruit punch, floral bouquet, honey, tropical guava and passion fruit, and assorted gummy candies. The dense palate balances sweet pineapple upside-down cake with tart ruby-red grapefruit, punctuated with lively allspice, dark cocoa powder, and ginger. The spectrum of bright flavors is underscored by deep spice and polished oak, while the impressive impact and skillful blending are spellbinding. Kentucky straight rye whiskey with two Canadian whiskies."
85,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>Wigle Small Cask Series Rye, 42%<review>Strong, bold aromas of rye grain, fruit (raspberries, black grapes), and dry cinnamon. Punchy rye on the tongue, starts 42% tame but quickly catches fire, roaring toward a barnburner of a finish. As the fire dies down, you find cocoa and rye oil in the embers. This young (12 month) rye is small-barrel shouty, but the roots are good. Solid effort."
86,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Murray McDavid 2003 Òrdha Meas 13 year old, 46%<review>An incredible surround-sound sensation of heavy peat smoke, with toffee, blackened spices, salted caramel, and warm leather. The journey is impressive, from the sweet toffee torn asunder by huge gusts of pepper, the tangy strands of citrus and banoffee pie with baked banana, the apples baked in brown sugar, before a final return to the smoke. A sweet and spicy finish, though the flavors recede fairly rapidly."
87,"<price>521<rating>91<whiskey>Kavalan King Car 40 th Anniversary Single Malt, 56.3%<review>This stirred a primeval urge in me for a good steak: bramble, blueberry, ripe Victoria
plum, Morello cherry, exotic spices, and a hot and heavy perfumed scent from the
select wine cask maturation. Sweet berry fruit—though mouth drawing—and a
delicious chocolate note, then it lashes the tongue with an intense peppery spice that
made me double-check the ABV, so dilute liberally. Savory finish with charred
oak. NTD15,000"
88,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Nelson’s Green Brier Sour Mash, 45.5%<review>
A Tennessee whiskey using wheat (instead of rye) as the flavoring grain. New leather, mint, dusty warehouse floor, pink pastilles, gingerbread, caramel, and dark fruits on the nose. Cinnamon up front on the palate, followed by brown sugar, chocolate, raspberry, vanilla wafers, allspice, and black pepper. The finish is lightly oaked, with creamy vanilla, more cinnamon, and allspice. A delicate but flavorful profile, with balanced sweetness and spice."
89,"<price>20<rating>72<whiskey>Freedom Moonshine White Rye, 40%<review>Many moonshine products are centered around corn, but Freedom Moonshine mixes it up with a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Yeasty rye bread defines the nose with an undercurrent of white grape. The entry is soft, with yeasty rye, vanilla, and bran flakes. There’s some structure in the mid-palate with rye spice and black pepper but it needs more. The finish is a little flat, all pointing to the need for a slightly higher proof."
90,"<price>300<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box 3 year old Deluxe, 49.2%<review>Not the pimply youth you might be mistakenly expecting, this tongue-in-cheek release is impishly contemptuous of the regulations challenged by Glaser during the transparency debate. Lemon bonbon, heavy vanilla scents, beeswax boot polish, and white chocolate are well integrated with peat. The exotic fruits and citrus zest tumbling with golden syrup are knocked sideways by clove and pepper. Water provokes more sweet smoke. A dry, spicy, waxy finish remains. (3,282 bottles)"
91,"<price>79<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Royal Brackla) 12 year old, 50%<review>The Old Malt Cask ‘Royal Jubilee Commemorative Bottle’ appropriately comes from one of two surviving Scottish distilleries with a ‘royal’ prefix, namely Brackla, located in the Northern Highland region, near Nairn. Maturation has taken place in a refill sherry cask. The nose is like a damp, empty house, with herbal notes, pencil shavings, oranges, and pine needles. Full-bodied and spicy, with freshly-sawn timber, pine, and brittle toffee on the palate. Citric, with camphor and pepper in the finish. 250 bottles. £50"
92,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts 22 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage (Cask #10866), 47.1%<review>Clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. Tar, pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, Spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. Lingering, satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!"
93,"<price>133<rating>90<whiskey>Reisetbauer 15 year old, 48%<review>Distilled by Hans Reisetbauer, this is like an amplified version of his 12 year old (see below). Red pears, pomegranate, walnut husks, and more active spices, from mace and asafetida to coriander. The flavors unfurl sedately over the palate like a flower coming into bloom: soft honeyed fruit, pear, raspberry, strawberry, spices, bramble, and chocolate drops. A drying finish of five-spice, dried apple, and chocolate. Best of this Austrian trio."
94,"<price>45<rating>79<whiskey>Oppidan Solera Aged Bourbon, 46%<review>Woodsy, wet leaves and fallen trees, dry grain bin, and fresh-cut cherrywood aromas. Cherry and dark plum up front, passing through to cocoa and wood, and chocolate-cherry candy on the end...none of which tastes like anything I'd call “bourbon” until the very last whisper of the finish. How do you make bourbon without a hint of corn or oak to it? Some strange ideas here."
95,"<price>406<rating>85<whiskey>Mortlach, 1997 vintage, 57.1%<review>Matured in a bourbon cask. Thick and creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, ripe barley, toasted marshmallow, vanilla wafer, key lime pie, golden delicious apple, lemongrass, and hay. The vanilla sweetness lingers to the finish, mixing with dried herbs and hay. I was expecting more from a carefully chosen Mortlach, given its pedigree, but this is still nice. (240 bottles) £250"
96,"<price>698<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 1977 (distilled at Strathisla), 48.5%<review>This 40 year old was matured in a refill American hogshead. Perfumed on the nose, with vanilla, soft leather, lanolin, and lavender. Watery soft fruits on the palate, with cocoa powder and ginger. The finish offers more cocoa powder, black coffee, and licorice-flavored oak. £500 (191 bottles, The Whisky Exchange exclusive)"
97,"<price>140<rating>84<whiskey>Sullivan’s Cove Cask Strength, 60%<review>There are now more distilleries on the Australian island of Tasmania than there are in Ireland, Japan, or Canada, and the island is demanding to be taken seriously as a whisky territory. At the forefront of the Aussie invasion is Sullivan’s Cove, once home to some decidedly ordinary whiskies, but now kicking into gear. This needs water, but is a unique mix of fruit, nuts, and soft malt. Clean, more-ish, and unique, this is Australia raising its flag."
98,"<price>125<rating>87<whiskey>Limeburners Single Malt M79, 61%<review>Nobody hollers louder than an Aussie when he wants to. This malt is matured in 100-liter American oak casks and finished in port barrels, just as Cask M76 is (also reviewed this issue), but if M76 is about pub rock, this is Wolfmother, a hard-hitting, rich, forceful but complex wave of loveliness, with fig and date to the fore, baked peach, and crystallized brown sugar. It's creamy, rich, mouth coating, and there's some menthol cough drop in there for good measure. A$130"
99,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Ballyhoo, 43%<review>Fresh and grassy, it’s quite dainty, with peach, Liquorice Allsorts, and light florals. Sugary sweetness, lemon slices, and candied orange jellies, concluding with hot white pepper and residual sweetness. This is sourced 4 year old grain whiskey finished in port barrels, though the label does not disclose this. Otherwise, an original, delectable finishing concept.

100,"<price>1000<rating>95<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Bicentenary Blend, 46%<review>
Drawn from stocks aged at least 28 years, this magnificent blend begins with aromas of burning heather, toffee, nuts, cigar smoke, leather, raisins, broken orange pekoe tea leaves, fruit loaf, black licorice, allspice, and cinnamon. Truly classic Johnnie Walker with smooth, warming flavors of orange, brown sugar, barley sugar, and gentle harmonious spice, followed by dark toffee, vanilla pod, candied peel, sultana, prune juice, malt, and cocoa."
101,"<price>135<rating>86<whiskey>Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at Loch Lomond) 18 year old, 60.5%<review>The strength is immediately apparent, though the nose has a curious mix of potato chips, tarragon, salt, and fizzy sherbet. The palate is more fruity, quite syrupy and sugary, with a lift of honeycomb and spicy ginger. It develops spiced orange notes, lime, soft summer fruits, vanilla, and Milka chocolate, encased in a thick, dense mouthfeel with nutmeg, dried peel, and powdered chocolate. A rumbustious dram at cask strength, but when tamed, it coaxes out ginger-sprinkled papaya and mango. (96 bottles) £89"
102,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Pearse The Original, 42%<review>Ripe yellow fruits, summer florals, satsuma peel, anise candy, and, unexpectedly, a catch of smoke at the back of the throat. Interestingly, the malt in this blend was made elsewhere, on the stills now installed at the Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin. Mellow, with tropical fruits, melon, and citrus. It becomes quite tangy, with a growing dominance of spices, ginger, and pepper. Shades of sourness creep in, heralding a light, spicy finish. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)"
103,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac, 64.3%<review>The youngster in the 2011 Antique Collection. One taste and its relative youth is confirmed. (But no worries; it’s mature enough to enjoy neat or with some water (and would be a killer in cocktails). This is rye whiskey in its most vibrant, masculine, and purest form. Bold spice (fresh evergreen, warming cinnamon), honey-coated orchard fruit, golden raisin, caramel, and brandy with a crisp, clean finish. The American equivalent to a young, cask-strength, smoky Islay whisky."
104,"<price>50<rating>94<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Fire Pot Barrel Aged, 10 year, 45%<review>The barrel was heated to 102°F for 23 minutes to dry the wood. A lush, silky-textured bourbon and very seductive. Caramel, coconut cream, marzipan, vanilla wafer and bright honeyed fruit abound, while teasing notes of tobacco, anise, subtle mint and a suggestion of bitter chocolate offer intrigue. A broad-shouldered, heavyweight bourbon with plenty of grit. 
"
105,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Usquaebach 15 year old, 43%<review>The blended malt in the series is drawn from select aged Highland single malt whiskies chosen by Stewart Laing. A luxuriant nose of rich, runny caramels, deliciously malty, and balanced with notes of dried apple, mixed peel, and pecan shells layered over warm spice. Smooth, with a light to medium body showing toffee apple, raisin, and caramel, tasting fatter with time and yielding pineapple notes. A finish of soft, sucked toffees and tingly spices. A top-class, well-executed drink."
106,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Arran) 2006, 46%<review>Bottled in 2015, this expression from Arran distillery was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Ripe apple and tinned peaches on the early nose, icing sugar, a hint of mint, and soft toffee. Lively spices and pear drops on the palate, with vanilla and cocoa. The finish is medium in length, with a twist of lemon and cocoa powder."
107,"<price>225<rating>90<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Brora), 24 year old, 1981 vintage, Cask # 06/656, 60.1%<review>The distillery closed in 1983, and was replaced by the Clynelish distillery across the street. Classic Brora. Fresh, and exuberant for a 25 year old whisky. Briny, with citrus zest, fruit gum drops, dynamic spices, and a hint of seaweed and smoke. Appetizing finish. All the flavors are well-integrated, and the whisky is very clean. If you don’t have a Brora yet, get this one before it’s gone.

108,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Ardbeg An Oa, 46.6%<review>Ardbeg's first standard release in nearly a decade, An Oa is matured in virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and bourbon barrels, with component whiskies married in the distillery's French oak 'Gathering Vat.' The nose offers sweet peat, smoky lemon rind, ginger, and angelica. A soft and sweet palate entry is followed by hot peat, black tea, peppery cloves, and aniseed. Black pepper lingers through the long, smoky finish."
109,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition (2011 Release), 55.05%<review>A marriage of four different bourbon recipes aged between 11 and 13 years. Very elegant and stylish, as with many of the Four Roses offerings. Its age also shows, with a firm measure of wood spice and grip on the nose and the latter half of the palate. Soft honey, bright fruit (sultana, ripe peach, tangerine), and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, crisp rye), evolving into darker fruit and more caramelized sugars on the palate, along with leather notes on the finish."
110,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Vinn Rice Whiskey, 43%<review>Delicate floral and sweet aromas—peach blossom, honeysuckle, fresh apricot, milk chocolate, and nougat—commingle with earthy, herbaceous notes: espresso bean, log pile, clay. The palate is light-bodied, but doesn’t shortchange on flavor, with vanilla cookie, apricots, hazelnuts in milk chocolate, apple blossom, and salted light caramels. Take your time with this whiskey—it’s mature in flavor, if not in barrel age, and it needs room to unfold its many intriguing layers."
111,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Clan Denny Speyside, 46%<review>If big smoke and peat don't float your boat and you'd rather metaphorically skip through a summer orchard while drinking whisky, then the Speyside version of Clan Denny is the full fruit bowl. The mixing of malts means that sherry and bourbon Speysiders get a say, so it's the complete package, and there's lots going on. Ultimately, though, it's not quite as focused as the Islay. Damn close call, though.€36"
112,"<price>18<rating>74<whiskey>Red Stag Spiced with Cinnamon, 40%<review>Given the Beam house character of cinnamon, I thought this was redundant till I got a whiff of the sweet cinnamon coming off this, like a tea made from Red Hots candies. The drink itself is thickly sweet, and more of the hot cinnamon candy overwhelms anything else; the bourbon is largely lost here. If anything, the finish is even more heavy-handed.  "
113,"<price>135<rating>81<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Caol Ila), 26 year old, 1979 vintage, 43%<review>Mature and gentle, when compared to the 1990 expression above. If the flavors of the 1990 Caol Ila reviewed above are nakedly exposed, then this Caol Ila is wearing a winter coat. The same flavor notes are there, but they’re less noticeable. Pleasingly salty, gently drying finish.

114,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>George T. Stagg (2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 64.6%<review>Caramel. Caramel. Caramel. It comes early and remains to the finish. In between this caramel sandwich, it’s nutmeg, cinnamon, jasmine, rose petals, baked apples, fudge, pecan pie, peanut brittle, and roasted peanuts. Over a mouth-coating palate, its complexity tingles and every note plays just under the rich and layered caramel that presents itself as a chew on the extremely long finish. This is a must-have sipper."
115,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Low Gap 100 Proof Whiskey, 50%<review>Made from malted Bavarian hard wheat and aged over 2 years in new and used American oak barrels, the nose is chocolate-covered pretzels and a dash of pepper spice with a slight edge. The entry is much softer than expected at this proof, driven by toasted wheat and dark chocolate, with vanilla and black pepper. A strong pepper kick at the end of the mid-palate drives a long, spicy finish. A surprisingly well-balanced and actualized young craft whiskey."
116,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Port Askaig 14 year old Bourbon Cask, 45.8%<review>This limited edition was distilled in 2004 and aged in eleven first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm lemon juice, rock pools, new tweed, and new leather, plus peat smoke and charcuterie on the nose. The palate is robust, sweet, and fruity, with spicy orange, vanilla, caramel, and earthy peat. Long in the finish, with light tannins and peat coated with stewed fruits. (420 bottles for U.S.)"
117,"<price>62<rating>86<whiskey>Dark Horse Reunion Rye Barrel Strength, 56.8%<review>A rare barrel strength 100% rye release from a craft distiller. (Dark Horse, Lenexa, Kan.) No age statement on this other than “less than four years.” Young wood leads things off with pencil, graphite, and sawdust. Once you get past the sharp wood, there’s lush maple, brown sugar, cinnamon, and rye spice. At 113 proof it’s still soft, supple, and lush but slightly tannic. The finish is spicy but not overly hot or dry. Great distilling hampered by small barrels, but still something special."
118,"<price>238<rating>81<whiskey>Glenlivet Guardians Single Cask 18 year old, 55.7%<review>A limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “Glenlivet Guardians.” A sherry refill, it’s a gentle expression that has typical Glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial, jasmine, and night-scented stocks. A subtle spiciness emerges with a drop of water. This general smoothness continues on the palate with ginger in syrup and an enlivening citric note on the finish."
119,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Palm Ridge Reserve, 45%<review>Distilled from corn, malted barley, rye, and flaked rye, and aged in small barrels with toasted orangewood chips. While this whiskey smacks of its youth, with green flavors of burnt cane stalks wrapped in orange blossom honey and charred marshmallow, there is something compelling about its primary spirit quality, freshness, and sincerity. A fine example of what it aims to be—young small-barrel whiskey."
120,"<price>119<rating>93<whiskey>Talisker 8 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 57.9%<review>
The youngest of the 2020 Special Releases. Warm tar, farmyard, charcuterie, and faint iodine on the fruity nose. Peppery stewed fruits and gentle woodsmoke on the voluptuous palate. Very prickly in the long finish, with fruit-and-nut dark chocolate and chile paste. An intriguing and attractive take on Talisker."
121,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>High West High Country American Single Malt (Batch 19I04), 44%<review>Earthy, phenolic, and herbaceous with a wisp of smoke and seaweed, this is certainly characterful. The flavor marries malty sweetness, red fruits, and a peculiar smoke, like a distant burning leaf pile or smoldering smoked jalapeños. While it tastes a bit young, and it’s certainly unconventional, this is a very intriguing whiskey, with an ashy finish delivering cocoa and nutty notes. (9,600 bottles)"

This kosher-certified single cask was matured in a refill bourbon barrel before finishing in a wine barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. The nose opens with barbecue smoke and new leather, then rosé wine, salt, and ginger cookies emerge. The nutty palate features woodsmoke, cocoa, instant coffee, stewed fruits, and more salt. The finish is long, with coffee, dry red wine, and prickly oak. (400 bottles)"
123,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 61.7%<review>The key to bourbons that use wheat instead of rye (like this Weller), is to get the right amount of wood influence to balance the sweet notes and add depth. This whiskey does a great job of it. Notes of dark fruit (blackberry, plum, blueberry), layered sweetness (maple syrup, toffee, caramel), and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Soft, pleasant finish."
124,"<price>81<rating>90<whiskey>Box The 2nd Step Collection 02, 51.2%<review>Expect six 2nd step bottlings, each showcasing different personalities of Box single malt; peating, wood, and cask size will be tweaked in pursuit of world-class quality. The twin pleasures of fruity sherry and smoke wrinkle the nostrils delightfully. An admirable balance: prudent use of peat, countered by apple, chocolate Kendal mint cake, nougat, and a fresh minerality. Resplendent in noble oloroso; think apple flapjacks, sultana, fig, maple syrup, and toffee banana, with a prickle of spice lasting into the finish. (5,000 bottles) SEK747"
125,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Bulleit 10 year old, 45.6%<review>Earthy, leathery, and spiced, this bourbon shows nice maturity and polish, evoking a well-worn wood-paneled barroom. The flavors offer good intensity and concentration, striking a nice balance of sweet and savory notes, as spicy cedarwood and cigar box come draped in toffee. Water releases some vivid chocolate, vanilla cream, and clove-studded orange. Nice verve, fine balance, and evident maturity."
126,"<price>115<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Rosy Apple Brûlée  (distilled at Invergordon) 1988, 46%<review>Perfect for fall; like strolling through an orchard polishing a windfall apple before crunching into its juicy fruit. Nose of caramel, dry worked wood, banana chips, cinnamon, and Indian spices. The palate is warming, with apple juice backed by a slowly growing spice note, later caramels, and a slight oxidized apple and brown peel note to end. The finish has a mildly bitter apple tinge and buzzing spices. The apple sings out with a dash of water. (494 bottles) £89"
127,"<price>50<rating>74<whiskey>Oppidan Malted Rye, 46%<review>Nasty smell of chicken coop: dried guano, some ammonia, and dust, with grain underneath. Happily, it tastes quite a bit better. Sweet grain, snap of rye spice, some dry cocoa powder, but there's still a dustiness to it, and a distinct small-barrel woodiness. Hard to get past that aroma. Seems like there's more than one problem here."
128,"<price>49<rating>91<whiskey>Grand Canyon Distillery Star Shine American Single Malt (Batch 001), 46%<review>This whiskey shows no reticence in asserting a unique and frankly thrilling personality from first sniff: tea leaves, coconut, brown sugar, saline, raspberry, plum, cinnamon, incense, and the freshness of a cedar-filled forest rush out of the glass. Such layered complexity—belying its 18-month age statement—carries ably into the palate, which is fruit-filled with dark plums and berries, lush with dark chocolate and baking spice, and tannic with oak and tea leaves. The well-balanced finish showcases dark chocolate, sandalwood, subtle spices, and cigar wrapper. Very approachable. (600 bottles)"
129,"<price>14<rating>81<whiskey>Seagram’s VO, 40%<review>A nose like light caramel corn, with a hint of biscuit dryness and a smidgen of cinnamon sugar. Light in the mouth, sweet and a bit spicy, with some cinnamon heat toward the end. There is a bit of a roar right in the middle, where the grainy sweetness catches fire briefly, but mostly this is fairly meek stuff. Made for mixing, no real flaws."
130,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>The Quiet Man 8 year old, 40%, <review>The nose on the single malt is spicier than their blend, with salted caramels and a smear of honey to boot. Key to the palate is the fresh fruitiness: melon, pear, and white grape. Additionally, there’s honey, a hefty malt presence, and spices keep things interesting. The finish of bruised fruit makes a greater impression at the back of the palate. Water emphasizes sweetness and blushing summer fruits. Great quality, though it doesn’t shout it from the rooftops."
131,"<price>125<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Single Minded Speyside 24 year old, 46%<review>Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80"
132,"<price>141<rating>88<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1988, 52.1%<review>You can feel the power, taut and straining, underneath the sweet nose of powdered sugar, sliced banana in custard, packing straw from tea chests, apple fritters, and sweet oak. There’s instant gratification, as this colossal whisky is fit to burst with honey, tropical fruits, apple, melon, and strawberry candy. Water adds shafts of sweetness to the nose and more jamminess to the palate. Made in Glasgow in the fall of 1988 and delivered at perfect drinking strength: they’ve bottled sunshine. (154 bottles) £90"
133,"<price>56<rating>87<whiskey>Lohin McKinnon Barley & Rye, 43%<review>Mild peat smoke wafts into the room as soon as you pull the cork. A big fruity nose ripe with red apples and hints of ether rides the peat. Sweetish spices glow with hints of chocolate, then fade slowly into typical malty tones that in turn become dry cereal notes. A flash of soapiness on first sip never returns, but lessens an otherwise beautiful young whisky. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$70"

Vanilla, lemon curd, and vinous fruit—overripe raspberries, boysenberry syrup—on the nose, along with candied rose petal and violet pastilles. The promise of sweetness is borne out by the palate, which is floral and fruity, with orange marmalade, Juicy Fruit gum, ginger-lemon cake, rosewater, nuts, and dry oak. The finish has orange marmalade, ginger, cinnamon, and chocolate."
135,"<price>55<rating>78<whiskey>Swift Single Malt Texas Whiskey, 43%<review>Pale gold in color, this whiskey is noticeably cloudy, even in a warm room. Swift's nose is pleasant, with malt, honey, and butterscotch. The entry is exceptionally thin, with a hint of malt and honey, but there's not much to it. In the mid-palate, it’s all about the bourbon barrel, so much so that the overall character shifts toward corn whiskey. A short finish with chocolate notes wraps up a whiskey that just doesn’t have much to say."
136,"<price>36<rating>85<whiskey>Knob Creek Rye, 50%<review>Unlike the Knob Creek bourbons (which are 9 years old), there’s no age statement with this new rye, which tastes relatively younger. It’s bracing, vibrant, and spicy. (The rye contribution is unmistakable.) Cinnamon spice and crisp mint dominate, with charcoal, botanicals, ginger, nutmeg, honeyed fruit, vanilla, and caramel. Warming spice finish. Its dynamic personality should shine in cocktails, but from a sipping, drinking neat perspective, I wish it was a little older like its siblings."

Elixir was finished in a mix of American white oak and ex-sherry casks.  The nose is mildly fungal, with caramel and sea salt. Treacle toffee, ginger, and citrus fruits on the palate, which is ultimately slightly acrid. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with licorice. £16 (350 ml)"
138,"<price>67<rating>82<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance 8 year old (distilled at Ben Nevis), 46%<review>This single cask (#10328) bottling was distilled in the summer of 2006 and matured in a refill hogshead.

Mildly metallic dark chocolate in the medium-length finish.  £42"
139,"<price>270<rating>84<whiskey>Royal Salute The Diamond Tribute, 40%<review>How can you really compare this to a quality blend priced under $50? It's hard not to view this as a victory of style over substance, and I object to premium whiskies being just 40% ABV, but nevertheless this is excellently made and the blending of whiskies over 21 years is exemplary. It's rich and viscous with light peach and plum notes and a pleasant earthy base."
140,"<price>80<rating>70<whiskey>Edradour Barolo Finish, 11 year old, 57.1%<review>Earthy, fleshy notes with brooding grape notes and a gamey finish -- the Nebbiolo grape influence is obvious.

141,"<price>28<rating>85<whiskey>Sortilège, 30%<review>According to the maple syrup geeks who make Sortilège, Quebec’s sugar maple forests produce their sweetest, woodiest, most robust flavors in the early days of the late-winter syrup season. This maple whisky is proof positive. Creamy sweet, slightly peppery, leafy in a good way, and richly imbued with woodsy maple, Sortilège stays firmly in the whisky camp, though just downwind from the sugar shack. Like maple syrup itself, it leaves the palate slowly. Price is per 375 ml."
142,"<price>23<rating>79<whiskey>Coldcock, 35%<review>Black bottle, cocked-fist logo. Sourced whiskey, infused with “green tea, hibiscus, eucalyptus, fennel, gingko and more.” Smells schnapps-ish, bright floral and woodsy notes, with a medicinal twang. Quite sweet, but not sticky; the herbs keep it perky. The whiskey is tamped down by the sweet and infusion; the finish gets even more medicinal. I’d like less sweet, and more whiskey. Not sure who the market is for this, but it makes a tasty add to tea."
143,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Arran Malt 17 year old, 46%<review>As Arran continues on its trajectory toward introducing an 18 year old expression, just 9,000 bottles of sherry cask-matured 17 year old have been released. Bottled at 46%, it has not been chill filtered. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with ripe pineapples, green apples, malt, and a hint of licorice. Luscious and nicely-textured on the palate. Lots of orchard fruits, sherry, and soft toffee. Mild spice and hedgerow fruitiness in the slightly drying, lengthy finish."
144,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>The Busker Single Pot Still, 44.3%<review>
Red apples bob in a sea of pot still spice on the nose, with whole almond, strawberry tarts, and brown sugar lumps. This is smooth, light, and delicious, with grilled muffins, bourbon biscuits, spice, vanilla, and well-toasted granola, with a later development of plum and blackberry. Burnt sugar and more spice on the finish."
145,"<price>65<rating>79<whiskey>Adirondack Distilling 601 Bourbon, 43.2%<review>The bottle states “Aged less than four years” but the nose says probably less than two. Unseasoned oak and sawdust dominate the nose. If you can get through the oak you’ll find honey, corn, cinnamon, and beef jerky. On the palate it’s dry cornmeal, caramel, and a hefty portion of abrasive oak. The mid-palate is big spice with cinnamon, black pepper, clove, and oak. A short dry finish puts a bow on a whiskey that’s overly tannic, dry, and oaky."
146,"<price>175<rating>96<whiskey>Willett Family Reserve, Single Barrel, Rye, Barrel #618, 22 year old, 1984 vintage, 68.35%<review>The first rye whiskey I have tasted to rival the Sazerac Rye 18 year old. This is a great whiskey from beginning to end. Soothing layers of sweetness (vanilla, maple syrup, cookie dough, toffee) are balanced by candied fruit and waves of spice (mint, cinnamon, nutmeg, cocoa powder).l The palate is clean, the flavors are deep, the spices are well-defined, and there’s not one hint of excessive or tired oak. A bench-mark rye. (A Ledger’s Liquors exclusive.)

The pleasing nose offers pears poached in dessert wine, heather, malt, and ginger. Rich and rounded on the palate, with immediate soft, ripe peaches, then figs, ginger, and cloves. Lengthy in the slightly nutty finish, with fruity spice notes."

Finally, much more floral. Peppery on the palate, with citrus fruit, gunpowder tea, medium sherry, and cocoa powder. The powdery cocoa notes persist in the long, spicy, discreetly oaky finish.  £80"
151,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>High West American Prairie Reserve Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch #1), 46%<review>A blend of two different bourbons—one 6 years old, the other 10 years old—with different mashbills.

(Available at the High West General Store.)"
152,"<price>152<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Dalmore) 17 year old cask #0080, 54.8%<review>This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg.

153,"<price>85<rating>89<whiskey>Penderyn Rich Oak Single Malt, 46%<review>Chocolate, rich berry fruit, honeydew, green grape, oat cookies, dark toffee, and oak spices on the nose. Flavors of chocolate flakes, Oreo, cinnamon, malt, and hazelnut, with a concentration of spices on the tip of the tongue, before a flavorsome finish of Hershey bars. It’s delicious and well-made, but occupies a very specific place on the flavor spectrum, so one to try before you buy.(792 bottles for U.S.)"

Nicely viscous on the palate, with similar notes as the aroma. But mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky. The flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger. It’s a rare treat to taste a whisky this old. If you like Lalique (and have the money), then this new bottling is worth some consideration, because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate. But I have tasted several other 50-plus year old Macallans, and I can say with certainty that the 50 year old Millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price (Only 420 bottles available worldwide.)"

156,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Jim Beam Harvest Collection Triticale, 45%<review>Triticale is a rye-wheat hybrid, so I’m expecting a rye-wheater hybrid bourbon. What I get is a screamer: spicy slice of a nose, hot cinnamon and sawn dry oak. Surprisingly light in the mouth, which is putting a smile on my face. Oak races through this, a spine coated with sweet grain, spicy notes, a bit of creaminess, and as the oak wraps up, I realize: no real rye bitterness. Cool stuff, a very good one. Price is per 375 ml."
157,"<price>40<rating>75<whiskey>Koval Levant Spelt, 40%<review>Provocative: spelt’s an interesting aroma. Grainy and a bit earthy, with hints of golden delicious apple all combining in the nose.

158,"<price>145<rating>88<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2015, 40%<review>Master distiller Brian Nation is really getting into his stride now. This vintage has creamed coconut, Jersey milk, vanilla desserts, crystallized jellies, fresh orange peel, and dry spices. To drink it is to celebrate American oak; creamy, golden, polished, with peach, honey, sherbet, sugars, butter frosting, sponge cupcakes, almond biscuits, and Quaker oatmeal squares. Spices are reactivated at the swallow. You have a whole year to enjoy this until the next one arrives. Really, there’s no excuse."
159,"<price>89<rating>80<whiskey>The Singleton of Glendullan Double Matured, 40%<review>The double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what Diageo will only say is a “special” cask. That’s helpful. There’s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly, then comes citrus, before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in. It’s quite bulked-up in the center of the palate, but finishes cleanly. One for those who like things on the thick-set side. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
160,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 56.2%<review>Light to medium in body (and quite pale in color), but quite invigorating. A flirtatious vanilla sweetness at the front of the palate quickly evolves into spicy, peppery, grassy notes. The whisky evolves further, expressing notes of smoke, tar, chewy seaweed, brine, feint green tea and olives. A persistent, if delicate, honey sweetness hangs on throughout to offer some gentility. Lingering, smoky finish. A raw whisky, but somehow compelling. An excellent value too! (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"

The finish is relatively short and tannic. (U.S. only)"
162,"<price>75<rating>85<whiskey>Scapa, 16 year old, 40%<review>A soft, easy-going whisky with a foundation of honeyed vanilla, caramel custard, and mouth-coating maltiness. Floral and brine notes are sprinkled throughout, as are cocoa, white pepper, and subtle edible seaweed. Soft malt and brine finish. A whisky with a gentler personality when compared to most other island malts, making it a nice introduction to the style. I would, however, like to see this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. I’d be more than willing to sacrifice some drinkability for greater intensity and more subtle nuances. Still, it is an enjoyable whisky, and enthusiasts of its predecessor -- Scapa 14 -- should also like it, albeit at a higher retail price."
163,"<price>44<rating>92<whiskey>The Legendary Dark Silkie, 46%<review>
Burning straw, berries, and allspice, but the smoke from the double- and triple-distilled peated malts beckons you in deeper, adding peppery barbecued meats, tree bark, and earthiness. The delicious palate brings stewed apple, currants, conference pear, raisin turnover, and brown sugar. Peat smoke infiltrates stealthily, leaving a finish of dried strawberries and pepper. This is a superb nightcap dram, and a great champion for smoky Irish blends. Editors' Choice"
164,"<price>150<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan 37 year old 1966 Vintage, 48.1%<review>Color is antique gold while the aroma is dry but creamy, with notes of vanilla, marshmallow, honey, and tropical fruit (pineapple, coconut). Palate is malty and creamy up front, with vanilla, marshmallow, and a hint of honey; briefly becoming fruity (again, the tropical fruits) before turning dry and oaky, with a big, long, dry finish (especially for a triple-distilled Lowlander). Lowland whiskies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. But most people don't know that some (especially Auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. As mentioned in my 'From the Stills' column, older vintages of Auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers, one cask at a time, and this is one of those casks. It is one of many 1966 vintage Auchentoshan whiskies I have enjoyed over the past 15 years. Auchentoshan, from a balance and complexity perspective, seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. Still, having said this, this one holds up fairly well for its age. Available exclusively at Park Avenue Liquors."

The glutinous mouthfeel has more mezcal influence, with dull fruit, herbal features, caramel, a snarl of pepper and chile flakes, and lengthy smoke and spice to finish. A bold creation, but I’m going to need more persuasion that this enhances the scotch."
166,"<price>38<rating>82<whiskey>Pendleton, 40%<review>A U.S.-only Canadian blend, bottled in Oregon. Rich toffee and caramel aroma with cashews and some dry cocoa. An easy entry, with sweet, light, but coating caramel, a keening note of young blending whisky, some cedar shavings, and a sweet finish that manages not to cling. Simple and sweet, practically pining for a bubbly mixer, but not bad for dessert, either. Quite typical of the category."

The grains are sourced from a Midwestern organic farmer collective. The nose is herbaceous, offering sarsaparilla, vanilla, licorice, and menthol. A somewhat jagged palate has notes of pine, ginger root, vanilla, sweet oak, heat, and pepper. The finish reprises the flavors of the palate—notably menthol, pine, oak, ginger, and vanilla."

The nose has cinnamon, molasses, vanilla seeds, and charred oak. It’s a big, chewy, oily mouthful packed with cinnamon, pecan pie, an explosion of spices, toffee, stewed fruit, and licorice, with a long, sweet, and nutty finish. Deliciously against the grain.

169,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2017 Release), 62.25%<review>Initially, it’s extremely perfume-like, with floral notes often found in fragrances. Then the fruit completely takes over: banana, blueberry, plums, cherry, apple, pear, and quince. Of these, the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture, followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker. Then, boom, baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish."
170,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Yellowstone Limited Edition Bourbon 7 year old (2016 Release), 50.5%<review>A blend of 7 and 12 year old bourbons, married in new toasted barrels. Vanilla, caramel-coated berries, orchard fruit, cinnamon, soft mint, and teasing toasted coconut-spiked chocolate. Dry, spicy oak finish. Nicely integrated. Excellent combination of youth and maturity."
171,"<price>42<rating>85<whiskey>Filibuster Dual Cask, 45%<review>There’s that 95% rye mashbill that tags this as an LDI-sourced rye…but it’s been finished in French oak white wine barrels. Pepper, warm ripe red plum, sweet vanilla, and a slice of nougat make for a sweet and urgent nose. The rye blows up in the mouth, lots more peppery spice, some flashy mint, and a thin, honeyed sweetness that hints at the nougat. Finish is a bit clingy, but a nice young rye with an interesting difference. (sourced whiskey)"
172,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Longmorn 16 year old, 48%<review>Longmorn is now being bottled one year older. Whisky companies seem to be discontinuing odd-year whiskies. Bowmore recently extended their 17 year old to 18. Ironically, in both instances, the older whiskies serve up more sherry and fruit. Both the Longmorn 15 and Bowmore 17 were considered benchmark whiskies, so these changes weren’t without risk. Still, in both instances, the new expressions won’t disappoint. This new Longmorn shows a mouth-coating maltiness -- Longmorn’s signature characteristic. Along with this, there’s ripe barley, honeyed fruit (peach, with subtle sultana and pineapple), gently complex nuts (almonds, brazil nuts), and a hint of chocolate-covered coconut. A lush, fruity-sweet dram that lingers long on the palate. True Longmorn devotees will still want to purchase a bottle of the 15 year old while they can."

But while the combination leaves a lot to be desired, and there are all sorts of youthful errors on show, the fruity, rich, and creamy core of this malt suggests that we’re looking at the stirring of a giant. Bottled this fall at 4 years, this is a holding tank. What follows will be immense. AUD180 (Not available in the U.S.)"
174,"<price>17<rating>82<whiskey>Canadian Club Reserve, 40% ABV<review>A bit of heat, faint nose of putty, light brown sugar, and fully ripe grapes. Stand-up whisky: sweet grain, a bit of rye spice, oak notes, and a good release on the finish. Just a touch of hollow sweetness in the middle, a kind of flat spot.  "
175,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>West Cork Export Stout Cask Finish, 40%<review>The trend for finishing Irish whiskey in beer barrels now connects Skibbereen and Castle Island Brewing Co. in Massachusetts, creating this breezy dram with aromas of lemon curd, shortbread, vanilla frosting, and dry spices, with plenty of coastal character. Melon, blossom honey, and peach on the palate, before a real creaminess develops, smudged by gentle spices. The later phase has toffee oozing from lemon bonbons, vanilla cake mix, and more fruity richness. (3,900 bottles)"
176,"<price>225<rating>91<whiskey>Tin Shed Iniquity Single Malt (Batch 10), 46%<review>A curious single malt smoked with native Australian peat and mallee wood stumps, and matured in port casks. The smoke expresses itself little on the nose, which shows aromas of nougat, apples, pears, blueberries, blackcurrants, raisins, and a mineral freshness. But the palate allows plenty of room for the smoke, which has a gentle, herbaceous pungency of tarragon, tobacco leaf, and eucalyptus; there’s also licorice, dark chocolate, coffee bean, and rich oak. The finish is equally rich, with lingering herbal smoke. (120 bottles for the U.S.)"
177,"<price>17<rating>83<whiskey>Highwood Canadian Rye, 40%<review>Sweet candy nose and a sour rye palate. Tropical fruit and orange zest, with sweet golden sultanas, sour apricot strudel, and Jujubes on the nose follow through to the palate, where they are joined by oak caramel, vanilla, and dusty grain. Peppery spices linger throughout. Wraps up with clean grain, pepper, and sweetish fruits. (Canada only) $23 CAD"
178,"<price>96<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Lead on Macduff! 2002 (distilled at Macduff), 46%<review>While most Wemyss Malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors, this one adopts a well-known Shakespearean reference. A sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. The nose offers toffee bonbons, coffee with condensed milk, and finally farmyard aromas. The palate is relatively sweet, with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit, plus a slight earthiness. The finish is medium to long, with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57"

Rejoice in this fresh, clean nose with sweet barley, lemon zest, lime pith, vanilla frosting, and early summer florals cut with a slight saltiness. This flavorsome whiskey has thick, juicy oils, and progresses from an early citrus dominance to reveal ginger, pepper, and ground almond. Water magnifies the citrus to great effect. £125"

This 25-cask batch puts up a nose of cantaloupe, green grapes, fruit syrups, Black Jack candy, kid leather, and a whiff of peat smoke. Soft in the mouth, it’s peppery, with herbal notes, slabs of vanilla fudge, and a little milk chocolate. Water adds a dash of creaminess, but it’s preferable neat. The wax-dipped bottles will appeal to Maker’s fans. €90"

Pipe tobacco and oak tannins speak to maturity. As the long sweet finish fades, a
warming glow and lingering barrel tones move to the fore. $120 CAD"
182,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Chivas Regal 12 year old, 40%<review>The assured Scotch whisky that became one of the classic blends. Dry and sweet, with a nose of vanilla sponge, fresh cut flowers, and marzipan over a malty base. Pleasingly oily, with flavors of burning butter, malty toffee, and cake mix, with gentle spices and hints of chocolate appearing the longer you hold off swallowing. The glossy mouthfeel makes this feel like an everyday luxury. A finish of spent spices, cocoa, hazelnut, and a waft of smoke brings it home."

The palate is light and candy-sweet, like strawberry jelly beans, candied rose petals, and sugar cookies tinged with cinnamon. Youthful and very light, but pleasant. (Total Wine & More)"
184,"<price>161<rating>84<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 6.1 5 year old, 57%<review>Smoke comes at you immediately, the morning-after smoke of a spent fire, mixing with reeds and rushes, a touch of coconut, and light oak. Water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the Band-Aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. The palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests, bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. It needs hefty degrees of dilution. A work in progress. £100"
185,"<price>38<rating>94<whiskey>W. L. Weller 19 year old, 1982, 45%<review>Antique amber color. Mature aromas of candied fruit, ripe berries, and black currants, nicely interwoven with toffee, dates, vanilla, and almonds. Reminiscent of aromas found in a candy shop. Fairly rich body, and smooth. Nice balance of flavors, witha gentle sweetness and oaky dryness throughout. An even-keeled whiskey. There are notes of candied fruit, ripe berries, vanilla, marzipan, and dates, with suggestions of sweet corn, vanilla, charcoal, and cinnamon. Becoming dry with a mature finish.

The spice notes (cinnamon, licorice root, vanilla) are balanced with light caramel and toffee. Quite dry, polished leather finish with suggestions of bourbon. While still enjoyable, I feel this would have been a better whisky if it were bottled 5-10 years ago."
187,"<price>72<rating>84<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Octaves Classic, 44%<review>Glenglassaugh distillery launched both unpeated and peated expressions matured in octave casks, approximately one-eighth the capacity of a butt. They have not been subjected to chill-filtration. The nose of this unpeated Classic is sweet, with ripe apples, peaches, toffee, and buttery spice. Smooth on the palate, with more peaches and now intense spiciness, followed by vanilla, aniseed, licorice, new oak, and mild cloves in the long, slightly citric finish. £55"
188,"<price>188<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988 Aromatic Orange Tobacco, 46%<review>Highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117"
189,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Glenrothes Bourbon Cask Reserve, 40%<review>Sweet, with a touch of saline on the nose: almond cream, lemon curd, fresh coconut, kumquat, and vanilla salt water taffy. The palate is soft and velvety, with apples and pears, toffee, a sprinkling of grapefruit and kumquat, and a touch of guava. Lingering sweetness on the finish, though it fades quickly. Water doesn’t do it any favors; taste this neat."
190,"<price>80<rating>83<whiskey>Westland American Single Malt, 40%<review>A non-age stated single malt from Washington State. Light amber in color, there’s more oak on the nose than you’d expect, along with baked apple, chocolate, cinnamon, and clove. Chocolate leads the entry, followed by clove, cinnamon, baked apple, and salt. A spicy mid-palate picks up some ginger and a dash of heat. The finish is fairly short and dry. This feels a bit young and lacks depth. An interesting start; let's see where it goes from here."

Soft, creamy, and elegant, with honeyed malt, custard, subtle butterscotch, and delicate fruit (orange, peach) peppered with spice (powdered vanilla, nutmeg). Well-balanced, gently dry, and easy drinking. A charming whisky (for a lazy Sunday afternoon, perhaps?)"
192,"<price>70<rating>96<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 45%<review>Very similar to last year’s release. Well rounded, with a gently sweet foundation (toffee, vanilla taffy), pleasant spice (cinnamon, mocha, soft evergreen), date, glazed citrus, bramble, and a gentle finish for a rye. A classic ultra-aged rye whiskey. "

Located high in the Japanese Alps, its buildings are hidden within a thickly forested national park, and there is something of that environment in this expression, which is filled with the scents of fern, wet bamboo, pine, and mint. Japanese single malt at its most beguiling.£40"
194,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Glenrothes Whisky Maker’s Cut, 48.8%<review>The nose offers rich fruit—plums and sultanas—with milk chocolate and new leather.

195,"<price>140<rating>81<whiskey>Bruichladdich 18 year old 1986 vintage, 57.5%<review>Its color suggests sherry cask influence, and its aroma confirms. The initial impact on the palate is lush fruit, followed by a clean honeyed malt foundation. Toffee and nuts emerge, with that satisfying Bruichladdich freshness and brine kicking in on the finish, providing some balance for the somewhat waxy, sherried sweetness. (A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive.)"
196,"<price>112<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 18 year old, 43%<review>Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose. Superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish."
197,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>The Balvenie New Wood 17 year old, 43%<review>The tell-tale rich honeyed Balvenie personality is spiced up by finishing it off in new charred oak casks, making a normally masculine whisky even bigger. The honeyed malt impacts the palate first, with intermediate notes of citrus fruit, followed by dried spices (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, and cocoa). The new oak impact is most evident on the whisky’s long, dry, spicy finish. A nice whisky, but perhaps a tad too much new oak for greatness?"
198,"<price>162<rating>86<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Malström, 46.4%<review>Mackmyra has used 30-liter casks held underground in the Bodås mine, the archipelago repository on Fjäderholmarna, and the forest repository in the Whisky Village in Gävle. Bruised banana, ground almond, Horlicks, spearmint, and budding foliage characterize the nose. The fruity whirlpool of flavor includes apple, watermelon, and poached pears, a second wave of dried fruits and fudge, all anchored by a clean edge of Kendal mint cake. Bubblegum on dilution. A final rush of coffee/cocoa before a sweet, juicy finish. €130"
199,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Wolves First Run, 53%<review>A blend of three whiskeys: one distilled from stout, one from pilsner, and one a rye. The nose has citrusy notes of lime, followed by vanilla, dried apple, and pine. The palate offers more pine, dried red fruits, oak char, and white pepper. Water releases blueberry, vanilla, bitter espresso, and pecan. Orange peel and pineapple on the finish, with dark chocolate, dried figs, and pine smoke. Balance, depth, and restraint. (898 bottles)"
200,"<price>120<rating>93<whiskey>Balblair 15 year old, 46%<review>

There’s something for everyone in this whisky, whose citrus brightness acts as a deft foil for darker earthy notes, showcasing the Highland distillery’s range. Lemon, orange marmalade, dried fig, golden raisin, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather on the nose; then more marmalade, chocolate, toasted nuts, cinnamon, and lemon pepper on the creamy, viscous palate. Still fresh with citrus, the finish slowly gives way to savory tobacco, leather, cocoa powder, and coffee bean. Subtle, nuanced, and perfectly balanced: a sleeper hit. Number 11 in the 2020 Top 20"
201,"<price>86<rating>86<whiskey>Glenmorangie Duthac, 43%<review>This Travel Retail-exclusive from Glenmorangie is the inaugural expression in the distiller’s new Legends series. Glenmorangie Duthac is matured in a mix of charred virgin oak and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Peaches, tangerines, cloves, vanilla, and toffee bonbons on the nose. Silky on the palate, with warm spices, honey, intense tropical fruit, and fresh ginger. Relatively long and creamy in the finish, with nutmeg, marzipan, and milk chocolate. Price is per liter."
202,"<price>91<rating>88<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1, 50.3%<review>A smashing, rich sherry nose showcases rosehip, elderberry, scorched oak, pipe tobacco, roasted coriander seeds, and damp dunnage warehouses. The core of the flavor is the lush orange jelly hidden in McVitie’s Jaffa cakes, combined with clove, malt, treacle, dried mango, and ginger. Water draws out stronger performances from the malty notes, together with some red berry characteristics. Let it roll around the mouth, it’s terrific stuff (Batch 1, 148 bottles). £57"
203,"<price>6000<rating>94<whiskey>White Bowmore 43 year old 1964 vintage, 42.8%<review>I like this Bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged, ultra-mature Bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). The oak is always present, but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate, just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit, bright fruit: peach, tangerine, mango, ripe melon, and pineapple. There’s a soft, gentle side to the whisky, too, enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup, orange creamsicle, and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge, along with teasing, earthy smoke, to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short, an outstanding whisky, but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore. 
   (Allocation information: 732 bottles available worldwide; 40 bottles are being allocated for the U.S., half of the quantity of Black Bowmore which was released earlier this year.)

204,"<price>127<rating>89<whiskey>Kornog Sant Ivy 2014, 58.9%<review>A cask strength expression of Kornog showing great maturity, yet born from Glann ar Mor’s small pot stills and condensed through the coils of their worm tubs. The smoke is beguiling; sweet and aromatic with tokens of vanilla and an underlying faceful of Atlantic sea spray. It is sweet, fruit-led—especially mango—though the alcohol never dominates, more like a sunburst through a cloud. The finish is moreish, returning to the salt, which only makes you thirsty for another pour. €95"

Delicate and restrained on the nose, with apple, pear drops, ginger, and malt. Initially, sweet sherry, then dark berry fruits emerge on the supple palate, with oatmeal stout. More apples, and ginger, plus prunes and chili in the long, warming finish. An excellent release from an underrated closed distillery. (4,976 bottles; 600 for the U.S.)"
206,"<price>129<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Snuffed Candle (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999, 46%<review>The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas, followed by peaches, gingerbread, treacle, subtle smokiness, and vanilla custard. The whisky really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke, ripe eating apples, and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88"
207,"<price>145<rating>84<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt Peated (distilled at Chichibu), 62.5%<review>Distilled 2011, bottled 2015. A warming, cozy, campfire of a nose, with everyone swathed in blankets as some hickory bursts into flames. There’s also an iris-like floral note and a vegetal thing at the back. With water, a nuance of cereal and wet dog. The palate moves into a rich, oily texture, then pulls back into hot embers of scented wood, and raspberry. The smoke is all-pervading, scented but sweet. Water brings out peppermint and smoky bacon. Hugely impressive for a 4 year old. £95"
208,"<price>455<rating>86<whiskey>Bowmore 25 year old Vintage Fèis Ìle (2016 Edition), 55.7%<review>This was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. In its 20s, Bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here, persimmon, nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. There’s a light oiliness on the tongue. The casks have added vanilla, red fruits, and spice, but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. Lovely. (200 bottles) £350"

The whiskey is 3 year old Turf Mor, only a year older, then mixed with some older whiskeys, and it's intriguing. This has all the oily, burning dust, smoky notes of a standard Connemara, but the rubbery youthfulness of Turf Mor is gone, and this is sweet, with orange notes, and a long, peaty, sweet finish. € 250  "

Mellow and smooth in the mouth, with warm corn and corn syrup notes, more oak and vanilla, but nothing overpoweringly sweet; good balance. Some oak in the finish, a slight curl on the tongue that's not unpleasant. “Single Barrel,” but no barrel number given. Sourced whiskey."

Only 519 bottles, all destined for the U.S. It is the richest, chewiest, sweetest, and fruitiest of all the Glenrothes whiskies reviewed here. Deep mahogany color, with notes of toffee apples, waxed fruit, burnt orange, prunes in syrup, and dark chocolate. The intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors, expressing notes of port wine, pot-still rum, and rancio.

Incredibly complex, subtle aromas of vanilla, honey, marshmallow, tropical fruit (pineapple, peaches, coconut), floral notes and a hint of almonds. Medium-full in body, and firm. On the palate, the flavors are complex and exhibit the same notes as the aroma, starting out gently sweet, but gradually becoming fruity and eventually drying out on the finish."

The palate is lighter than the 14 year old, and seems to float, lacking an anchor. When it does come down, it does so with a cereal crunch. Water lightens it still further, just leaving a mix of oak and cereal, and an astringent finish. (France only) €56"

219,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Talisker 175th Anniversary bottling, 45.8%<review>A tamed Talisker. The classic Talisker personality shows-seaweed, brine, peat smoke, and freshly ground pepper on the finish. There are even other interesting flavors I enjoy, notably vanilla, licorice root, charcoal, and bitter chocolate. But this whisky needs to be a little livelier to be a truly great whisky. While there’s no age statement, there’s older whisky in here for sure, and maybe that’s part of its “reserved” nature. It certainly is a nice whisky, but I would prefer the more vibrant Talisker 18 year old -at two-thirds the cost.

221,"<price>115<rating>91<whiskey>Auchentoshan 21 year old, 43%<review>I feel this is by far the best whisky in the standard Auchentoshan portfolio, and it is one of the best Auchentoshans ever released. It’s delicious, nicely balanced, and with lovely depth for a Lowland whisky. Baked muffins, creamy vanilla, honey, and caramel blend nicely with delicate fruit notes (lemon, red current, strawberries). An impeccably balanced whisky. Similar to the 10 year old reviewed below, but with greater depth and a drier finish."
222,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Union Horse Distilling Reunion Straight Rye (Batch 2), 46.5%<review>Made with 100% rye aged up to 5 years, this starts off surprisingly fruit-forward, with poached pear and zesty, clove-pierced citrus, though the wood is beginning to dominate. The palate fires up the rye spice, underscored by cocoa, turning hot with some adhesive notes and finishing with fresh cereal grain and bitter oak tannins. A wood lover’s whiskey."
223,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Wilderness Trail Small Batch Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch #D02), 50%<review>Despite some obvious youth, the aromas here are enjoyable, as Honey Nut Cheerios and bake shop sticky buns and cinnamon rolls hearken to the primary grain flavors. Fruity banana, Raisinets, and lots of fresh oak are apparent. Marmalade and citrus oil flavors are tasty, but the gingerbread heat and raw oak suggest it would benefit from additional maturation."
224,"<price>99<rating>86<whiskey>Sullivans Cove Cask HHD430, 47.5%<review>Sullivans Cove whisky is matured in French oak and bottled as single cask offerings, and there is a big variation in taste. As a rule of thumb, though, anything with a number higher than 330 is worth checking out. This is a standout, moving away from the Speyside-style fruitiness of some casks toward treacle, chicory coffee, and burnt hazelnut on the nose. The taste has apricot, sweet orange, honey, cinnamon, and menthol, and the finish is soft and light. A$95"
225,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Knob Creek Twice Barreled Rye, 50%<review>Gentle notes of lilac, sweet perfume, and rye bread are underscored by orange blossom, spearmint, and blueberry. Heaps of spice—clove and cinnamon hearts candies—will delight rye fans, as the mix of berry fruits and lively spices really comes to life with water, revealing bitter citrus pith, black pepper, vanilla, and a finish of generous char and tobacco smoke."
226,"<price>49<rating>86<whiskey>Kanosuke New Born, 57%<review>
Treat your nose to an education in young whisky and enjoy the flavors, as this is just 16 months old. Young and green aromas with citrus, fresh pear, young peapods, cress, pencil erasers, and the glue strips on manila envelopes; it’s unencumbered by sweetness or oak influence. Orange zest, chocolate, and sugary sherbet ride a shuddering wave of alcohol, from which Oreo cookies, mint, and Belgian chocolate cigarellos emerge."
227,"<price>160<rating>80<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Moine Dram an Stiùireadair 10 year old Feis Ile 2014 bottling, 56.6%<review>Stiùireadair means “helmsman” in Gaelic. This has been finished for a year in Marsala casks. The nose is all garden compost, moist vegetation, light smoke, and highly oxidized: like a young vin santo (or indeed Marsala). Very nutty, with an almost vermouth-like quality. The palate is all clove, anise, cherry stone. Those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. This particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95"
228,"<price>350<rating>91<whiskey>GlenDronach 25 year old 1993 Master Vintage, 48.2%<review>The nose is fragrant and floral, featuring ginger, hand-rolled tobacco, vanilla, hazelnuts, and ultimately, sweet sliced-apple aromas. Full-bodied in the mouth, with stewed fruits, milk chocolate, raisins, almonds, and lively spices. The finish is leisurely, with darkening milk chocolate, tannic oak, bitter tea, and persistent spiciness."
229,"<price>28<rating>77<whiskey>Centennial Spiced, 35%<review>Sweet, heavy vanilla, powdered sugar, and dog-toothed spring violets, it smells very light with soft hints of sweet floral perfume. What begins as viscous and creamy on the tongue suddenly becomes refreshingly bitter and loaded with hot, singeing spices. Pepper and dried candied orange peel linger while the sweetness dims. A pleasing bitter finish fades into a warm glow. Although the whisky struggles at first, it breaks through in the middle with its spices and heat. (Canada only) C$31"
230,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Single Cask #5054 (distilled at Glen Grant) 1990 Vintage, 56.0% ABV<review>Here’s a whisky not seen very often in the U.S. When it is seen, it’s from one of the independent bottlers. I have always felt that younger Glen Grant whiskies make a nice introduction to the single malt category-especially for a blend drinker trading up. The whisky is usually light to medium in body and uncomplicated-with no harsh edges to be particularly offensive. And so it is with this whisky. A soft, cereal grain maltiness marries nicely with floral, delicately fruity notes throughout. Gentle, dry but malty finish, with suggestions of shortbread cookies and vanilla. A nice representation of a younger Glen Grant. The flavors are clean and tight.

231,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Straight Rye (2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 63.6%<review>Initially, an unwanted mustiness is present, but it quickly turns into a damp cellar note, followed by dill, eucalyptus, fresh oak, and mint. Hints of smoke emerge over pecan shell and chewing tobacco. Then a cherry cough syrup note appears, with baking spices gaining steam, but the whiskey never truly finds a desired dominant note or balance. The finish gives it hope: it lingers with a hint of brown sugar."
232,"<price>37<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfiddich 12 year old, 40%<review>The world’s best-selling single malt. Isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? It might be me, but it strikes me that ’Fiddich has more heft to it these days, with a sherried element giving the pear, apple, and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet, plump, sultana underpinning. This then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance."
233,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Bond & Lillard, 50%<review>Delicate and flavorful chocolate, caramel, and dried fruit begin a delightful sipper that really becomes easy drinking, with hints of cola, cherry, and maple syrup. Then it’s the spice, specifically cinnamon and allspice, over a slight bitterness, like grapefruit rind, that suggests complexity awaits. But no, the short finish hurts its next-level consideration. Price is per 375 ml"
234,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>Sullivans Cove Double Cask Single Malt (Batch DC097), 45%<review>A bright golden whisky with a nose like a basket of fruits: green apple, honeydew, clementine, and pastries. Made from Tasmanian barley and matured in bourbon and French oak barrels, the fruity palate follows the journey begun with the nose, though with greater emphasis on citrus than apple. Layer upon layer of peppery spice overlay some sour fruits, ending on a finish of grapefruit sourness. (950 bottles)"
235,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye, 40%<review>A blend of American rye, Canadian rye, and port. Gentle spice and sweet vanilla appear on the nose, but the impression of browning apple, wet leaves, and oxidized red wine are somewhat dreary. Simple and sweet up front, it feels thin, like fake maple syrup, with more sweet vanilla carried on a rather light body, almost resembling some rice whiskies."
236,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel (Barrel #15-4956), 65.85%<review>Hot barrel wood, like opening a rickhouse in July; light allspice, vanilla, and fiery alcohol. Drinkable without water, surprisingly. Hot syrup, corn sugar caramel, tannic oak, and a bit of stickiness. An interesting look at Jack Daniel’s: unblended, undiluted, untamed. It’s still Jack—sweet, insistent—but it’s taller, bigger. I could say I’d like even more heft, more complexity…but would that be asking Jack to be something it simply is not?"
237,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Kaiyo Mizunara Oak, 43%<review>Finely ground spice, vanilla sponge cake, light honey, and brown sugar cubes, as well as the mizunara fingerprints of aromatic wood and incense. Pastry, egg custard, and allspice flavors; there’s just enough body apparent as the spices settle down, unleashing a substantial wave of vanilla creaminess. Leaves a long aftertaste, like a light-hearted pillow fight between the vanilla cream and the fading spices."
238,"<price>25<rating>78<whiskey>Ron Burgundy “Great Odin’s Raven” Special Reserve, 40%<review>What does this say about how far whisky has come? We live in an era where you can now buy the official whisky from a major motion picture. This has a deep amber color. Really deep. The nose brings warm muffins, caramel, and grassy notes with a good dose of smoke. It’s a sweet concoction with a peppery kick. There’s a tinge of polypropylene before a short, clipped, spicy finish. It just needs to find more of its own identity."
239,"<price>22<rating>81<whiskey>Canada Gold, 40%<review>Whisky maker John Hall says value whiskies save used barrels from being wasted. Study the label and you’ll find this lush mixer hails from Hall’s Forty Creek distillery. Sweet voluptuous butterscotch and corn syrup slather peppery heat and the mildest tannins. The pepper turns ticklish on the roof of your mouth until charred wood, burned toffee, and vanilla custard flow over it. Simple but very sippable, it’s a bit luxurious for a mixing whisky. (Canada only) C$24"
240,"<price>212<rating>82<whiskey>The Balvenie Madeira Cask 21 year old, 40%<review>Another Travel Retail exclusive, but what is a highly lucrative retail sector will inevitably demand items that shoppers can’t buy elsewhere. Imagine Balvenie Port Wood 21 year old, but with more sweetness; damson jam, blueberries, and a slight singed note before maple syrup calls in from the back. It’s big and rounded and, for me, just lacking the definition and complexity of the Port Wood. For sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps."
241,"<price>250<rating>87<whiskey>Tomatin 1988 Vintage, 46%<review>This vintage expression from Tomatin has been matured in a mix of bourbon and port casks, and is being released in batches. The first comprises 2,500 bottles. The soft, fragrant nose offers strawberries, apricots, honey, and caramel, with a final hint of dry port. Fruit and caramel notes carry over from the nose onto the palate before dark chocolate appears, along with a suggestion of smoke. Subtle oak and ginger in the lengthy finish."
242,"<price>500<rating>93<whiskey>Glenrothes 25 year old, 43%<review>The oldest in the quintet of expressions in the Glenrothes Soleo Collection, this was matured predominantly in first-fill sherry casks. The nose offers pineapple, mango, malt, and nutmeg. Richly sherried on the muscular palate, with caramel, citrus fruits, licorice, and wood tannins. The finish is long and drying, with sherry-soaked old oak. Glenrothes at its very best."
243,"<price>103<rating>91<whiskey>Hart Brothers (distilled at Glen Grant) 22 year old, 51.1%<review>A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66"
244,"<price>54<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Spice King, 46%<review>This NAS version is a little smokier than before, with ground pepper, toasted coriander and fennel seeds, and a dusting of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is light initially; early orange and lime flavors are extinguished quickly. Warm cocoa, malt, chocolate shavings, black cherry, raspberry bubblegum, and concentrated dark fruits complement restrained spices and faint smoke, followed by a hot, spicy cinnamon finish. It’s pretty decent, but the palate doesn’t quite match up to the promise of the nose. £37"
245,"<price>150<rating>96<whiskey>Elijah Craig 20 year old (Barrel No. 3735), 45%<review>From one barrel, and only sold in one location, but well worth the effort to procure a bottle. Nutty toffee, pecan pie, apricot, berried jam, and nougat, peppered with cinnamon, mint, cocoa, and tobacco. Warming, with polished leather and dried spice on the finish. Seamless, richly textured, and impeccably balanced. (Exclusive to the Bourbon Heritage Center at the Heaven Hill distillery in Bardstown, KY.)"

Peanut lovers, pour yourself a glass of this: It’s multi-dimensional where legumes are concerned. Peanut shells, spiced peanuts, dry-roasted peanuts—they’re all here, interspersed with fresh mint, cinnamon, iced tea, and tobacco barn. There are tingly spices—black pepper and dried chiles—on the palate, along with black tea and peppermint. The mouthwatering finish is generously oaky, with persistent spice and nuts."
247,"<price>228<rating>89<whiskey>Lark Single Cask, 58%<review>Lark is on Australia’s frontline, but this is a hard sell. This is big bucks for untried whisky. No doubt though, this is history in the making. There’s a big cinnamon and nutmeg kick to this, and with water, a rootsy, sweet apple core and a menthol hit wrap themselves around flavors of crab apples and dates. It’s different, easy to like, and exciting. Australian whisky is on a roll. AUD220 (Not available in the U.S.)"
248,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Westland Peat Week (2019 Release), 50%<review>Smoke acts as an emulsifier of fruit, nut, and oak flavors in this deceptively delicate whisky. Toasted marshmallows, pound cake, crème brûlée, cinnamon Red Hots, and earthiness on the nose; water brings out candied pineapple. Sweet smoke and tropical fruit are well-integrated on the palate, with salty and mouthwatering flavors of grilled fruit and blueberry jam. Over time, more oak and nuttiness emerge, wafting into a gentle burnt marshmallow and toasted-walnut finish. 1,083 bottles"
249,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold, 40%<review>Like opening a lunchbox in elementary school: you’ll find the distinct aromas of peanut butter sandwich with strawberry jam and a smear of Marshmallow Fluff, plus a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie, and some apple blossom and tea rose. Soft and sweet in the mouth, with plenty of fruit and flowers: banana split topped with crushed pistachios, rose oil, white chocolate, halva. This whiskey is finished in charred maple barrels and undergoes a second filtration with the Lincoln County Process."
250,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Moon Harbour Pier #2 Peated Edition, 47.1%<review>Was the short finish in Château La Louvière casks from Bordeaux’s Pessac-Léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty, charcoal intensity, hints of chocolate, vanilla pod, clove, and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry, rhubarb, orange peel, and plums, speckled with aniseed, pepper, clove, and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint, before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20,000 bottles)"
251,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Koval Single Barrel Rye (Barrel 1,326), 40%<review>Certified organic, distilled from 100% rye. First whiff: like that smell when you tear apart anti-theft plastic packaging. Swirl and warm to get unseeded rye bread, old books, bitter grass. Palate is quite right: sweet grain and a bit of mint balanced by bitter rye oils and wood, slipping into a sweet but wood-framed finish. Pleasantly youthful whiskey in the mouth; nose is sharp still."
252,"<price>185<rating>91<whiskey>Kavalan Sherry Cask, 57.1%<review>This dark, walnut-colored dram delivers the fabulous first-fill sherry cask characteristics we love: raisin, mixed peel, fruitcake, marzipan, Brazil nut, jellied fruits, and nutmeg. So wonderfully thick and chewy that you need to resist the temptation to pick up a knife and fork. It imparts dark weighty fruit, blackened oak, cooked apple, and a twister of peppery turmoil. Add water liberally to unlock figs, dates, and plums."
253,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>John J. Bowman Single Barrel, 50%<review>Triple-distilled bourbon from Virginia. Actively aromatic, blowing right out of the glass: tart berries, hot corn, oak, and stick cinnamon. Hot, but surprisingly soft and light for 50% (triple distillation?), with sweet corn and more of the berries, wrapped in oak and a touch of char. Everything persists to the finish, including the heat, leading to a twist of oak at the end. Manages to be big but light at the same time."
254,"<price>99<rating>85<whiskey>Edradour The Fairy Flag 15 year old, 46%<review>This expression was released to celebrate the Scottish feature film “Fairy Flag,” and after maturing for 8 years in bourbon barrels, the whisky then spent 7 years aging in oloroso sherry casks. Initially meaty with rich sherry, raisins, and cocoa powder, then increasing vanilla notes, plus warm leather and wood polish. Sweet and very spicy on the palate, with caramel, chili, and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with peppery plain chocolate. £65"
255,"<price>64<rating>84<whiskey>Broger Medium Smoked, 42%<review>The key smoke characteristic here comes from kilning the barley over beechwood. The resultant aromas conjure up sweet mash, charcoal sticks, slabs of fish from the smoker, and dilapidated casks warming in the sunshine by the shoreline. It’s been matured for over 3 years in French Limousin oak, and the taste runs sweet with peach, nectarine, and melon, through Seville orange, to mixed peel and taffy candy. A finish of dried fruits, with lingering smoke in the tail. €48"
256,"<price>505<rating>85<whiskey>Glenturret 26 year old 1986 (Hunter Laing/The Glenturret), 46.8%<review>With only a 10 year old house bottling of Glenturret available, brand owners the Edrington Group have collaborated with independent bottler Hunter Laing to produce this ‘semi-official’ 26 year old expression, matured entirely in refill bourbon casks. Pineapple, dates, honey, and hard toffee on the floral nose. Full-bodied, waxy and chewy on the palate, with vanilla, ginger, cherry liqueur chocolates, and dark spices. Lengthy in the finish, with emerging bitter chocolate notes. £300"
257,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Glenlivet French Oak Reserve 15 year old, 40%<review>I enjoy Glenlivet whisky for its subtle elegance, floral notes, along with a delicious ""peaches & cream"" flavor. For this particular whisky, finishing some of the whisky in new French oak barrels adds depth, dried spice (vanilla, clove) and pleasing dryness to the Glenlivet profile. This whisky is more polished and refined than the 12 year old expression it replaces."

In 2018, the honor goes to Canadian Club. Cedar lumber, fresh apricots, hints of bonfire, and sweet applewood on the nose. On the palate it’s butter tarts with vanilla, waves of pepper, pears, peaches, bonfire notes, and hints of pipe tobacco. Crisp, clean, and slightly bigger than Canadian Club 40 year old, the 41 is woodsy, silky, and mouth filling. (2,472 bottles for U.S.)"

A whiff of smoke, lemon curd, vanilla, and allspice on the nose. Supple in the mouth, with baked apples, sherry, and fruity peat. Spicy dark chocolate and nutty oak on the finish. Richer and more rounded than previous editions, thanks to sherry cask influence."
260,"<price>450<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie Margaux Cask Finish 18 year old 1987 Vintage, 46%<review>Waves of fruit (apple pie, orange marmalade, sultana, ripe pineapple), accented with notes of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, evergreen), particularly on the finish. (In the past, I’ve thought that a couple of these limited edition Glemorangie wood finishes were a little overdone with the finishing, but not this one)."
261,"<price>92<rating>85<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at	 Auchroisk) 12 year old, 59.3%<review>Pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss. All very aromatically intense, with quite a hot focus on the tongue. With water you keep the concentration and add in lemon, jellied fruits, and light, dusty spiciness."
262,"<price>110<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 17 year old, 48.4%<review>Rich gold. Here we have a good example of Bunna’ in full ‘welcome home to a warm house after a cold walk’ mode. Warm, sweet, steamy, with a light mineral note, dried fruit, walnut, and that giveaway gingerbread signature. The palate is clean, spicy, and drier than the nose suggests, but has a soft center. A lovely dram for a chill summer evening. £75"
263,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 36 year old 1967 vintage, 40.2%<review>Older expressions of this unpeated Islay dram are often quite delicious, but they aren't easy to come by. The best ones, like this one, take the sweetish toffee/nutty foundation of younger expressions and add layers of depth and complexity. This whisky just continues to evolve on the palate. The entrance is creamy in texture with layers of sweetness (caramel, vanilla fudge, toffee), becoming nutty and marzipan-like with subtle background fruit. The finish is long and pleasingly dry, with a hint of salt. Very entertaining and satisfying."
264,"<price>288<rating>87<whiskey>Royal Mile Whiskies 40 year old, 47.1%<review>A terrific value blend of Macallan, Glenrothes, and Tamdhu matured in sherry casks has produced one of the darkest whiskies on the market. Inescapable aromas of thick Seville orange marmalade, polished saddle leather, too-hot-to-hold sweet chestnuts pulled from a brazier, dry fruitcake, 100% cacao, and Medjool dates. Sweet prunes, chocolate ganache, cola, tannins, and singed wood spices combine to produce a formidable proposition. Heavily sherried and oaky for sure; this has been bottled not a day too early. (337 bottles, Royal Mile Whiskies only) £200"
265,"<price>76<rating>93<whiskey>Douglas Laing Big Peat Christmas 2013, 54.9%<review>Launched a few years ago with a Dr. Haddock-like cartoon figure on the label, Big Peat does just what it suggests it does…and then some. It's a mix of Islay peated malts and includes some Port Ellen, but don't get distracted by that. Instead, indulge yourself in the biggest, peatiest, oiliest, earthiest, grungiest, gunkiest slab of industrial malt this side of a leaky steam engine. This whisky just gets better and better."
266,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Straight Bourbon (Batch 8), 60.5%<review>A nose of cherry, peppermint, vanilla frosting, pound cake, buttered toast, cherries, cola, peanut shells, rye seed, and old warehouse. The palate is big and powerful yet smooth and sophisticated. It’s chewy and spicy, with chocolate fudge, peanuts, white pepper, fresh cherries, bitter espresso, leather, and old oak. There’s great length on a finish of chocolate, cocoa powder, raspberry, cigar box, and baking spice. Toasty and delicious; a tour de force."
267,"<price>600<rating>94<whiskey>John Walker & Sons King George V, 43%<review>Highland toffee, dried banana, salted caramel, seashells flipped from rock pools, and crispy-skinned oily fish barbecuing over a fire. Sweet toffee meets cinnamon, pepper, and clove, as an express train of smoke clatters through, leaving intense citrus peel oils and green fruits in the backwash. A spasm of spice marks the finish: arid, amid baked fruits and toffee. Leave me now, I have everything I need."
268,"<price>36<rating>89<whiskey>1792 225th Anniversary, 46.075%<review>When spice meets fruit in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Here, chili pepper melds with banana and pear, then baking spices tumble into passion fruit. Next, it’s cornbread, vanilla ice cream, hazelnut, and brown sugar. Finally, a touch of caramel appears toward the end, where a medium but lovely finish takes it home. This will make a fine table whiskey for easy sipping."
269,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 71.3%<review>At this strength, it’s almost like getting two whiskeys for the price of one. A great value, considering its age. (It’s not identified on the label, but was distilled in 1993.) Try to find a great 18 year old, cask-strength single malt scotch for this price. Very mature — with a good dose of oak — but not excessively so. Notes of toffee, tobacco, dark molasses, roasted nuts, dried vanilla, leather, and a hint of dusty corn. Dry on the finish, with lingering leather and tobacco."
270,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Forty Creek Heart of Gold, 43%<review>Each fall, whisky lovers in Canada and Texas anticipate John Hall’s new limited edition whisky. This year’s sits squarely in the golden heart of classic Canadian rye. Tingling gingery pepper is bathed in ultra-creamy butterscotch, woody maple syrup, black tea, and barley sugar. Prune juice and ripe dark fruits dissolve into dried apricots and zesty hints of citrus. Then floral rye notes turn dusty, with gentle wisps of willow smoke. Complex, full-bodied, and slowly evolving, so let it breathe. C$70"
271,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Kinahan’s Small Batch, 46%<review>They say that Jerry Thomas made Kinahan’s his whiskey of choice in 1862. A sniff today might reveal molten honey, flapjacks, dry grist, and a fresh apple Danish (apple, custard, and pastry). The palate has a nip of lozenge sweeties, more apples, peppermint, vanilla, and a slow slide into chocolate, lemon pith, and cocoa. The 25% malt content presses home the flavor. Palate-coating. It’s a blend of fine quality, and Kinahan’s revival adds to the resurgence of Dublin’s whiskey story."
272,"<price>90<rating>81<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master's Collection 1838 Sweet Mash, 43.2%<review>Background on the Master’s Collection: this is the fourth of the 100% pot still whiskeys from Woodford Reserve in their Master’s Collection series (the previous being two different Four Grain releases and a Sonoma-Cutrer wine finish expression). All four have a common pot still character to them, and their flavors really expand most bourbon drinkers’ concept of bourbon. The second batch of Four Grain is still my clear favorite of the releases so far. It’s balanced and complex.
1838 Sweet Mash review: Burnt orange/amber color. Sweet, fruity, and spicy on the nose and palate. Notes of orchard fruit (peach, apple), golden raisin, bramble, and spice (cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg, and clove) on a bed of sweetness (maple syrup and honey). It’s thick and viscous in texture and quite sweet on the front end of the palate, but dried spices and oak emerge mid-palate and rescue it. Long, spicy, resinous finish. I would rather the whisky didn’t go from predominantly sweet to mostly dry and gritty. I wish these two components were better integrated. If they were, I would have rated this whiskey higher."
273,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Blood Oath Pact No. 2,  49.3%<review>A combination of 7 year old year rye finished in port barrels and 11 year old wheated and rye bourbons. It presents exceptionally fruity aromas, with prominent plum and floral hints, fresh-cut grass, toasted pecan, burnt butter, brown sugar, and a touch of chocolate. On the palate there are warm cinnamon apples, fried donut with caramel icing, and a hint of dry popcorn. The medium finish offers lovely toffee. Sourced whiskey."

The nose is creamy, gentle, and sweet, with vanilla, rum raisin ice cream, and a subtle, contrasting peppery note.

275,"<price>48<rating>84<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Single Malt, 40%<review>Hot tropical fruit, warm band-aids, and a mix of Dum-Dum lollipops in the nose. More sweet and creamy on the palate, with a hint of the band-aids, and dry grip of oak at the end. A fairly quick drink, but a clean and layered one."
276,"<price>480<rating>86<whiskey>Dalwhinnie 25 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2015), 48.8%<review>Distilled in 1989, this edition of Dalwhinnie is the fifth to appear in this annual line-up, and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. 5,196 bottles are available. Pine, vanilla, and honey on the nose. Sweet on the viscous palate, with unripe apples, pineapple, cinnamon, and honey. The finish is medium in length, slightly savory, with dark chocolate and a hint of sweet oak."

Very fragrant -- fruity and spicy -- with notes of vanilla, lemongrass, ginger, sultana, citrus zest, key lime, and green grapes. There’s a floral component, too (rose petals?). A very delicate Macallan, and quite suitable as an aperitif. (749 bottles produced.)"
278,"<price>94<rating>80<whiskey>Laphroaig PX cask, 48%<review>A mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in Pedro Ximenez, this new release is, initially, only for Travel Retail. The problem with finishing peaty whiskies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke, but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with PX. Think treacle scones, raisins, and tarry tobacco. A thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. A sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave.

279,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength (Batch A), 58.6%<review>Prominent red apple, tropical fruits, pot still spices, and oloroso sherry notes; this shows great balance. The spices are powerful, with a roasted aroma like a crooked burnt match. The palate is gripped by the high alcohol as pepper and clove break open over the tongue into a bed of red apple, baked citrus, and caramel. Unquenchable layers of flavor usher in a likable, bubble gum finish. (252 bottles)"
280,"<price>53<rating>90<whiskey>Craigellachie 13 year old, 46%<review>Light amber. The initial impression is one of bulk. There are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical, old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character. A statement whisky that is a must-try."
281,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Wyoming Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #1447), 44%<review>Nose is mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, cinnamon, and baked apple. Follow-through on the palate is almost exact: mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, etc., plus a nice bit of extra alcohol heat and quiet oak shaping the finish. A mild-mannered bourbon, which I feel is like a mild-mannered rodeo bull; out of place. There's nothing wrong, but it's a bit too easy-drinking, too mild. Bulk up."
282,"<price>280<rating>93<whiskey>Redbreast 21 year old, 46%<review>Honey, vanilla, peppercorn, Golden Delicious apples, macadamia nut, green banana, and clove-spiked orange. The flavors are bright with green apple, banana, vanilla, and citrus, developing a delicious creaminess to support the pot still spices. The creaminess really crowns this older whiskey as something special, with the bourbon wood playing a greater role than in younger, jammier Redbreasts. The finish is wonderfully long and warming, with spice, tangy orange, and oak."
283,"<price>39<rating>73<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Mosby’s Spirit, 40%<review>Made from 100% rye, and USDA certified organic. Very hot for 40%; herbal nose, very green with rye. Much smoother on the palate, and very quick. There’s a fast shot of rye mint up front, some grassiness, and a sharp flick of heat…and then it vanishes, leaving only a fading flinty-sweet afternote. Clean, but not a lot of substance."
284,"<price>100<rating>76<whiskey>Woodstone Creek 5 Grain Bourbon, 47%<review>There's a medicinal, darkroom aroma right up front, and a dry graininess (with just a dusting of baker's chocolate) to the nose. It carries through in the mouth, with a faintly chemical astringency that takes away from the underlying corn sweetness. Very hot finish. Water helps bring more sweetness out a bit, but cuts some of the body out from under. "
285,"<price>17<rating>86<whiskey>Evan Williams Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Some bourbons are balanced or complex; this is an all-around versatile pour with initial notes of lightly toasted oak, brown sugar, and butterscotch. A fun maltiness, concentrated caramel, and slight hints of cinnamon and watermelon Juicy Fruit hammer home its sipping potential, but its short to medium finish suggests that it’s more suited for cocktails. But hey, why not both?"
286,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #5), 50.1%<review>So soon? This latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts, five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. Hugely complex and obviously mature, it is one to sit and smell forever. Marzipan, mocha, pain au chocolat, manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. It opens into cigar, sandalwood, citrus, and ripe black fruits. The palate is equally layered and expansive. It takes water, but only a drop, for that density is all-important."
287,"<price>20000<rating>95<whiskey>Ardbeg 1974 Vintage (Cask #3145), 49.9%<review>Cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
288,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>M&H Classic Israeli Single Malt, 46<review>This kosher whisky has abundant flavors from both the bourbon and shaved, toasted, and re-charred (STR) casks. Golden syrup, caramel, pastry, vanilla, and marshmallow on the nose with floral top notes, hints of dried apple, and bold nutmeg, cinnamon, and pepper. A firm, juicy-sweet palate with caramel, vanilla, shortbread, honey, orange, nectarine, pepper, nougat, and almond. The finish is short, sweet, and lightly spiced. Editors' Choice"
289,"<price>202<rating>86<whiskey>Highland Park Sigurd, 43%<review>Heather honey, malt, newly-cut hay, pineapple, and very slight smoke on the nose. Leather, malt, cinnamon, a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. Medium in length, with a hint of honey behind the oak, spice, and smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €150"
290,"<price>265<rating>91<whiskey>Port Askaig 18 year old 2000 Single Cask (Cask No. 309927), 50.8%<review>Aromatic on the nose, with vivid fruitiness mingling with briny, rubbery peat: grilled apples and pears, lemon zest, and peach slices. On the palate, it presents as simple, but wait a beat to let the whisky settle—and add a bit of water—and that simplicity reads more as softness in texture. The flavors are expressive and consistent with the nose: lemon and lime zest, peach, apricot, and salty-peppery peat. It finishes with bittersweet smoke, tobacco leaf, black pepper, and lingering oak. (250 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
291,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Connemara Cask Strength, 58.9%<review>A peat-smoked malt whiskey from Ireland’s Cooley distillery, similar to many smoky Scotch whiskies. The difference to me is that I don’t get as much of the seaweed and coastal notes often found in the Scotch whiskies. Still, there is plenty going on in this whisky, including a lovely creamy vanilla and honeyed malt underbelly to tame the smoke. It reveals more of itself with the addition of water. If there were peat-smoked Lowland Scotch whiskies, they might taste like this. 
"
292,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Wiser’s Red Letter 2013 Release, 45%<review>Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, candy sweetness, and strong bitter grapefruit pith overtake an initial dry dusty rye. After years in an assortment of bourbon barrels, new wood is used to tame the rugged rye notes while adding complexity and breadth. The oak has left obvious traces behind, with barrel notes and hints of fresh-cut firewood. Candied, in the vein of Wiser’s Legacy, but sharper, harder, and much crisper. Canada’s non-chill filtered reward for being Wiser’s biggest fan. (Canada only.) C$99"
293,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Talisker Triple Matured Edition, 48%<review>This no age statement Talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to Friends of The Classic Malts. Successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks, charred American oak hogsheads, and European oak refill casks. Ozone, fresh asphalt, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose. A big pepper hit in the mouth, backed by earthy peat, Elastoplast, vanilla, and citrus fruits. The pepper lasts right to the end in the long, steadily-drying, charcoal-fueled finish. £80"
294,"<price>130<rating>85<whiskey>Longrow, 14 year old, 46%<review>The stocks of the “new era” Longrow keep getting older (and better). A pleasingly sweet foundation of burnt caramel, vanilla fudge, and toffeed nuts is challenged by earthy peat, tar, damp barnyard, and brine. Earthy, smoky finish. A nice whisky with great potential, but still needs a few more years. 
"
295,"<price>137<rating>92<whiskey>Blue Hanger 11th Limited Release, 45.6%<review>It’s the intensity of flavor that just grabbed me by the lapels and spun me round. It harbors intense tangelo juiciness; that unparalleled concentration of deep citrus skillfully mingled with dark vanilla, dried apricots, and gentle smoke. This goes the distance, delivering wave after delicious wave: peach juice, mandarin, pineapple cubes, and lemon zest. A firm, unctuous finish shows a little charred wood and dark sugar cloaked in fine smoke. Tongue pleasing and very special indeed. £90"
296,"<price>80<rating>96<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 69.05%<review>No age statement, but distilled in 1998. A beautiful expression of Stagg, and a lot of bourbon for your buck. Easy to drink with the addition of water, showing caramel, nougat, dates, dark chocolate, polished oak, along with a hint of leather and tobacco. Slightly better than last year’s release—richer, thicker, and more balanced. I’m enjoying Stagg’s more rounded, less aggressive demeanor of late. A classic! Editor's Choice."
297,"<price>166<rating>92<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Laphroaig) 1998, 60.8%<review>Any sherried Laphroaig is welcome, and this does not disappoint. Rich, resinous, medicinal, with underlying soft fruits, the smoke is all-pervading, but never dominant. In other words, it isn’t just complex and balanced, but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). With water, there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think manzanilla pasada. The palate shows storm clouds gathering over Texa. Rich dried fruits, cacao, and a ferny lift on the finish. Fantastic. (The Whisky Exchange only)  £100"
298,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Buffalo Trace 15 Minute Infrared Light Wave Barrels, 45%<review>Nicely rounded and very drinkable. Warming cinnamon, vanilla bean, and dried fruit, wrapped up in creamy caramel and light toffee. Pleasant, gently sweet finish. Great anytime. 375ml"
299,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 18 year old, 46.3%<review>The nose is nutty and yields sweet sherry, Jaffa orange, old leather, instant black coffee, and a suggestion of ozone. The palate is oily and textured, with more sherry, dried fruits, nutmeg, and dark chocolate. The finish lingers with brine and pepper."
300,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Mars The Lucky Cat “Ash ’99,” 43%<review>Yes, there is a cute, mewing black kitten on the label. Turkish delight, pomegranate, rose water, lemon, lime zest, clementine, and sandalwood. A syrupy texture with the sweetness of hard fruit candy; there are flavors of cooked apple, mandarin, butterscotch, melon, ginger, and chili pepper. The slow crescendo of spices is particularly impressive. The pleasantly fruity finish sees a drop-off in the spices. Distinctively aromatic and exotic."
301,"<price>100<rating>79<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Rosebank), cask #1536, 1991 vintage, 13 year old, 59.3%<review>Matured in a refill sherry cask. (A first-fill sherry cask would have completely dominated Rosebank’s delicate flavor profile.) With the addition of water (which is necessary), the whisky becomes quite cloudy. Rosebank’s traditional honeyed vanilla, grass/hay, and soft fruit are accentuated by lightly sherried, soft toffee flavors. An interesting whisky, but the flavors are not clean and well-defined enough to warrant a higher rating.
"
302,"<price>36<rating>87<whiskey>Rebellion Rye, 43%<review>Give the nose time to open up, and it reveals herbal and earthy aromas, with fennel, dill, root beer, and evergreen forest, as well as sprinklings of cinnamon and cloves. The palate is chewy and vivacious, although the proof keeps the heat in check; flavors of chocolate, clove, allspice, orange oil, and nutty oak are ultimately enfolded in cigar wrapper, black pepper, and orange Creamsicle."
303,"<price>59<rating>87<whiskey>Rock Oyster, 46.8%<review>The final cornerstone of Douglas Laing’s Remarkable Regional Malts range, this blended malt celebrates the best from the Islands. The peat smoke finds harmony with the nose of pine, lemon curd, dewy lawns, and vanilla fudge. This is gloriously full-flavored; the peatiness certainly delivers, but there is a pleasant nip of saltiness too. The black pepper finish leads to a long lasting salty smack on the lips. Make this your hipflask essential for bracing excursions along the shoreline. £38"
304,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Glen Turner Heritage Double Wood, 40%<review>It’s Double Wood, Jim, but not as we know it. Here, the blend has been given a Madeira finish, presenting an appealing nose of spun sugar, golden raisins, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hazelnut. The blend has a creamy texture, with good weight to carry the flavors of orange peel, mango, and dried pineapple, leading to a zesty spark on swallowing. Wood spices, nuttiness, and lingering toffee make for a satisfying finish. The extra Madeira maturation is understated and perfectly judged."
305,"<price>2000<rating>93<whiskey>J.J. Corry The Vatting No. 1, 47.8%<review>Blended in Co. Clare, this concoction of rare Irish whiskeys from 1991 is an utter delight. Honeydew, orange frangipane, rose Turkish delight, vanilla icing, and beguiling floral perfumes. Golden syrup, orange oils, vanilla, and caramel, sprinkled with lemon and lime zest; this has a slightly waxy mouthfeel that melts to become creamy and silken, with heavenly spun sugar and candied orange slice flavors. (60 bottles)"
306,"<price>375<rating>91<whiskey>Lombard Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 21 year old 1991 Cask No. 172, 49.7%<review>Aged in a bourbon hogshead, allowing the distillery character to shine through. Fresh, lively and inviting (especially for its age), with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit, peppered with brine, vanilla, and a hint of baker’s chocolate. An oily texture adds weight. Dry, deliciously appetizing finish. An excellent aperitif whisky, but enjoyable anytime. (D & M Wines and Liquors exclusive.)"
307,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Wildrye Five Drops Montana Bourbon, 45%<review>Herbal, licorice, and cinnamon notes are initially quite alluring, but stifled by a slightly sour note peering through. Still, this is identifiably bourbon, with sweet corn drive, leathery oak, and cocoa coming together nicely before a warming finish of spice candies."
308,"<price>47<rating>86<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 105, 45%<review>Drier on the palate than the 90, with more caramel than honey, and more oak spice (especially vanilla) and grip on the finish. Still, rather light in personality. However, I’m looking for more sweet notes to partner with the dried spice. Price is per 375 ml."
309,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Founding Spirits American Whiskey (Batch #10), 50%<review>Distilled from corn, oats, wheat, and barley at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits. The nose has clean, sweet applewood smoke, raw peanuts, oolong tea, grain, and treacle. On the palate there’s strong oak, but it’s well-tempered by spice, smoke, savory nuts, grilled apples, and chalky saline minerality. The finish is savory and nutty—appetite-inducing—and overall, it takes water well."
310,"<price>33<rating>82<whiskey>1910, 40%<review>12 year old 100% Canadian rye-grain whisky is transported from Canada to Hood River Distillers’ plant in Oregon where, after adding glacier water from Mt. Hood, it is bottled. Tart lime juice, ginger, and seething pepper brighten a rich combination of vanilla, butterscotch, and maple fudge. Crisp charred oak meets wet slate as raisins meld into floral notes with tinges of Canada balsam and fresh-cut pine. This rich, weighty, well-balanced whisky is decidedly fresh and exuberant."
311,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>A.D. Laws Four Grain Ruby Porto Cask-Finished, 47.5%<review>Aromas of orange, roasted pineapple, lime, pine nuts, cinnamon, and leather on the nose, with a cherry-strawberry note. Light, refined cherry on the palate, with roasted walnuts, dark chocolate, and light char. Water unlocks bright cherry and chocolate fudge, with notes of char and roasted coffee beans. A nutty, fruity finish carries on the red berry note, along with a swirl of vanilla and chocolate. A deft balance of fruit, sweetness, and spice."
312,"<price>419<rating>90<whiskey>Pittyvaich 28 year old, 52.1%<review>The lost Dufftown distillery of Pittyvaich last appeared in the Special Releases as a 25 year old in 2015. Like that bottling, this was also aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Initially, it’s slightly savory on the nose, with salted caramel, walnuts, and spicy raisins. Oily on the palate, with pineapple, apple crumble, malt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Toffee, milk chocolate, and licorice in the peppery finish. (4,680 bottles)"
313,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Lot No. 40 12 year old Cask Strength, 53.1%<review>Cask strength Lot No. 40 has been in production at Hiram Walker Distillery for over 75 years for use as flavoring whisky. Finally in bottle, this is more than regular Lot No. 40 amped up. New notes of halva, pansies, blistering spices, tropical fruits, minty candy canes, and peanut skins are layered over the lilacs, rye bread, dark fruits, and slatey rye of its 43% standard release. Long, glowering finish."
314,"<price>105<rating>89<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Linkwood) 14 year old 1999 Cask # 978, 55.8%<review>From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (U.S. only)"
315,"<price>400<rating>85<whiskey>Pittyvaich 1989 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 49.9%<review>Good to see Pittyvaich back in the Special Release roster. Here we have the heavy, nutty character of the distillery given full expression. The emphasis here is on a mix of nuts, cake mix, and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. When neat, the palate has real density that is enlivened by water, which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. Worth a dram."
316,"<price>92<rating>87<whiskey>Pentland Skerries, 46%,<review>Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and Christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter"
317,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Murray McDavid (Distilled at Ardbeg) 1990, 8 year old, 46%<review>Pale white wine color. Smoky, youthful aroma. There’s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young Ardbeg. Big beautiful explosion of smoky, tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely. This is the first Ardbeg release I've tasted since the distillery's long shut down in the 1980s. After the shut down, they discontinued their floor maltings, so I was concerned that it might not taste like the Ardbeg of old. Ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief. This one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it. My only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky. Otherwise, this is wonderful stuff!"
318,"<price>160<rating>87<whiskey>Classic Cask 23 year old Oloroso Sherry Butt, 43%<review>A charmingly sweet nose with Christmas cake, swollen raisin, dates, sticky toffee pudding, walnut, nutmeg, and gentle spices confirm the presence of the oloroso cask at work. An oily texture, with butterscotch, tangy peel, and mandarin, becoming darker and nutty, with sultana and plum skin shading into menthol and streaks of bitterness. Finally, Brazil nut, macadamia, and clove, with a hot, dry, nutty finish. (771 bottles)"
319,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Barrel Proof, 67.25%<review>The fourth in a series of limited-edition Taylor bottlings, and the first barrel-proof release. Layered sweet notes of caramel and nougat, with bright orchard fruit (especially nectarine), dried spice (vanilla, mint), and pencil shavings. The dried spice notes linger on the finish, along with tobacco. Bourbon with attitude."
320,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan Port Cask finish, 40%<review>Here Jim Swan has taken the bold step of double maturing an already quick maturing spirit, but it works. Blueberries and rich oak are to the fore, while Kavalan’s cherry accents act as the link between spirit and Port. Think rosehips and crème de mures. Thick and liquorous. List price is approximate."
321,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Glenfiddich Grand Cru, 40%<review>A 23 year old expression that was maturated in American oak and a small number of sherry casks before a finish for up to 6 months in French cuvée wine casks. Canned apricots in syrup, toasted marshmallows, apple blossom, and honey on the nose. Pears, vanilla, freshly sawn timber, warm white bread, caramel, cloves, and milk chocolate on the relatively full palate. Toffee and instant coffee in the lingering finish."
322,"<price>38<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old 1984, 45%<review>Deep amber color. Rich, mature aroma of molasses, maple syrup, and leather, with background notes of creamy vanilla, tobacco, and subtle mint. Full, thick, mouth-coating body. Sweet up front (molasses, maple syrup, rich toffee, candied fruit), becoming spicy (vanilla, mint) and then dry with notes of leather and tobacco. Long, dry finish."
323,"<price>16<rating>70<whiskey>Jim Beam Rye, 40%<review>For rye whiskey drinkers, Jim Beam isn’t the name you’re usually looking for, but there’s a distinct rye nose: menthol, dill, herbs, and boiling oats. The palate is dull, lacking the up-front spice typically found in ryes, and only shows hints of vanilla, caramel, and eventually cinnamon. The extremely short finish leaves me wondering if it would fare better at a higher proof."
324,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Winchester Small Batch, 45%<review>Oak, and some candy-like sweetness, and alcohol heat…and not much else. A shy nose for a bourbon. Very hot in the mouth,
somewhat two-dimensional corn and oak, just put together without anything else around them. A pretty simple whiskey, with a slightly cloying finish. Nothing really flawed, just nothing really standing out, either. Sourced whiskey."
325,"<price>170<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut 100 (U.S. release), 57.1%<review>The whisky gets its name from the fact that 57.1% ABV is 100 proof in the British measuring system: the alcohol concentration needed to sustain flaming gunpowder. It comes in 100 cl bottles and only 100 bottles are being released in each territory. This malt takes no prisoners, with big, bold flavors dominated by peat, but with chutney-style fruit and an array of spice making for a rich, intense taste experience."
326,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Arran Single Sherry Cask (Cask 69) 1998 Vintage, 56.6%<review>Predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious, but it’s not heavy or dominant. Clean, bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie, light toffee, dates, dark chocolate, and polished oak. Long, soothing, oily finish. Another solid effort from this young distillery."
327,"<price>318<rating>88<whiskey>Overeem Port Cask Matured #29, 60%<review>This is more reassuringly tawny than the standard strength, and the alcohol strength oozes out of the glass. The nose is cleaner and fresher than the standard, with maraschino cherry, freeze-dried raspberries, white chocolate, and tamarind pulp. Neat sips showcase rich dark fruits of blackcurrant, black cherry, and dense chew bars. A dash of water amplifies the sweet fruits with heavenly, dusty aromatics and red, fleshy fruits. Yours for a pretty penny. £189"
328,"<price>500<rating>90<whiskey>Teeling Gold Reserve 26 year old, 46%<review>Very limited and therefore at the top end of the price range. Distiller Alex Chasko says that every time he tastes it he's taken back in time to R.E.M.'s “Green” tour, so what's not to love? Dried apple dustiness gives way to pineapple, melon, and kiwifruit. It's all very sweet until late on, when spice cuts in."
329,"<price>155<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet) 1968 Vintage 35 year old, 43.1%<review>Younger bottlings of Glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. But such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions, which often become dominated by sherry and oak. This one, at 35 years of age, demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. What impresses me most about this whisky is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. It isn’t the least bit tired on the palate, and it is very clean, without the excessive woodiness often found in whiskies of this age. Plus, the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla, honeyed malt, peaches, pineapple, heather, and just a touch of oak. A very polished, refined whisky."
330,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, 55%<review>From rickhouse G, floor 5, barrel 136 is a study in caramel. Layered in crème brûlée, salted-caramel cupcake, caramel brownie, caramel apple fritters, caramel popcorn, and the classic caramel chew. Then, complexity: chocolate truffles, nutmeg-dusted hot bananas, ginger ice cream, cinnamon-candied almonds, and warm povitica. It’s so creamy, so rich, and so unrelenting with masterful flavor that the powerfully long and caramel-forward finish is expected. Splendid, must-have sipper. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)"
331,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>WhistlePig FarmStock Crop 001, 43%<review>Bright and lively, with violets, plenty of fresh oak, and traces of mint and pine, leading to a palate of butterscotch, bright citrus, warming spice, and sweet vanilla with drying and dusty cocoa. There is a glimmer of youth, expected given that 20% of this blend is their own distillery-made rye, aged less than 2 years. It’s an exciting glimpse of what’s to come, but the younger rye does little to enhance the great stuff they’ve been sourcing."
332,"<price>180<rating>90<whiskey>Kikori Ten, 41.2%<review>A decade of aging in an oloroso cask has bestowed aromas of stewed plum, prune, throat lozenges, and thick fronds inside a tropical palm house, while still executing the same dreamily serene Kikori character. Age has enhanced the mouthfeel of this rice whisky, serving up a smooth, clean palate of tart orange, damson, and plum sweetness, with a complex twist of spice and drying orange peel on the finish.

A wonderful balance of red wine and malt notes on this Australian shiraz finish: black currant, cooked apple, blackberry, After Eight mints, black tea, chocolate praline, cherry compote, and dark toffee. Malty, with soft fruits and strawberry jam flavors, then cinnamon, blackberry, dark toffee, clove, pepper, and oak char, with the brighter red summer fruits kept in reserve until the final stages.

334,"<price>156<rating>87<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 22 year old, 52.2%<review>With no great wood on show, this is a Caol Ila which is time—not oak—driven. A very scented, nay herbal start, like bouquet garni with light smoke, grapefruit, sea-washed stones, ozone, and heather blossom. The retention of aromatics is gorgeous. Water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics, so take your choice. Well worth a look."
335,"<price>1450<rating>91<whiskey>Longmorn 23 year old, 48%<review>The oldest house bottling of Longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket, which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price. The nose is classic Longmorn: soft and sweet, majoring in honey, hazelnuts, caramel, and milk chocolate, while the creamy palate features orchard fruits, ginger, and allspice. The finish is lengthy and softly spiced, with honey, orange, and sweet oak."
336,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>The Classic Cask (distilled at Highland Park) 23 year old 1982 vintage, 43%<review>Honey, vanilla, heather, and citrus are the major components of this Highland Park, with a hint of youthful peat in the background. Some polished oak kicks in on the palate towards the finish. A pleasant whisky for those who like a mature Highland Park without the sherry cask influence. (A Bayway World of Liquor exclusive.)"
337,"<price>160<rating>91<whiskey>Classic Cask 23 year old Original Cask, 43%<review>This archetypal midnight dram enthralls with aromas of cedar wood humidor, blossom honey, hazelnut, vanilla pod, treacle cake, and maple syrup. Dry as leaves, save for some floaty florals. It’s less weighty than some whiskies at this age, with a balanced show of cinnamon, cocoa, berry fruits, dried grapefruit, hard peel, wood spices, dark toffee, and oak. A finish of dark vanilla, oak, spice, and leather make for a fine digestif. (782 bottles)"
338,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>William Wolf Rye, 46%<review>This 100% rye has a beautifully developed nose of roasted coriander seed, white pepper, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, though the spices dominate and impede other characteristics from shining through. The initial mandarin and tropical-fruit sweetness is left behind as the peppery spices roar away. The finish sees the spices vanish into thin air, as if teleported back to the mother ship. Ideal for rye-based cocktails."
339,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Writers’ Tears Double Oak, 46%<review>Walsh Whiskey has rarely released better whiskeys than those of 2019, which included two expressions made in collaboration with the Legaret family of Deau Cognac. Here, they apply bourbon and French oak cognac barrels to the unique marriage of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskeys, arguably the most premium interpretation of the Irish blend. Aromas of dark berry fruit, cinnamon, fudge, milk chocolate, graham crackers, jellied fruit, and a smudge of dry spices. Compelling, well-structured whiskey with cinnamon, chocolate, dark toffee, pepper, and ginger; never cloying, nor overly sweet, just a richly rewarding glass. Number 10 in the 2019 Top 20"
340,"<price>33<rating>85<whiskey>Glenlivet 12 year old, 40%<review>As with the ‘Fiddich (reviewed in this issue), here’s a malt where an improved wood policy has brought a dram to life and added complexity. The Glenlivet has always been about lightness, but the trick is to have sufficient solid base to allow its flower to blossom, so as well as lily, orchid, and pineapple, there’s a thick creaminess that gently beds all of these flighty flavors down. With water, there’s mandarin and rose petal, and a sneeze of white pepper. Simply lovely. Value Pick"
341,"<price>46<rating>83<whiskey>Singleton of Glendullan 12 year old, 40%<review>The U.S. Singleton comes from Glendullan, a distillery that makes a sweet, light spirit. Here, a percentage has been aged in ex-sherry casks, which has added a layer of fruity sweetness — think port-like sloe notes, Muscatel, and wisteria. The wood is lightly handled, allowing the aromas full rein on the palate."
342,"<price>265<rating>83<whiskey>Deanston, 30 year old, 46.7%<review>Aged in bourbon and sherry casks, and then finished off in oloroso sherry casks for two years. The sherry provides a good measure of lush fruit, brown sugar, and a slick texture on the palate. The sherry is clean and uncluttered, if somewhat overshadowing the traditional Deanston honeyed malt foundation. I’m also picking up some burnt marmalade, lemongrass, and ginger. Soft, sweet, fruity, finish. 
"
343,"<price>110<rating>83<whiskey>John McDougall's Selection (distilled at Bladnoch), 15 year old, 55.8%<review>The only distillery-approved bottling of Bladnoch in the United States. When compared to the Gordon & MacPhail bottling above, this one isn’t as sweet or creamy in texture. There’s more citrus fruit and a drier, spicier finish. This one is also bolder and a bit more aggressive. 
"
344,"<price>763<rating>91<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla) 1967, 43%<review>Part of the Rare Vintage range, this was matured in first-fill sherry butts. Spicy sultanas and figs on the nose, plus a menthol note. Fragrant old hessian. The palate is initially malty-sweet, with sherried Christmas cake notes, then plain chocolate and raisins emerge. The finish is long, spicy, and drying in a leisurely manner, with the expected level of tannins for a whisky of this vintage.£620"
345,"<price>35<rating>91<whiskey>Mars Iwai 45, 45%<review>

This new, higher proof Iwai (pronounced EE-why) was designed for cocktails; however, it’s supple and more than capable as a neat sipper too, with pleasing aromas of honey, ripening pear, barley, exotic woods, and citrus. The palate of honey sweetness, sugar cubes, vanilla, pear, apricot, and spice bows out with honey, breakfast cereal, nougat, and white chocolate. It’s a delicious and unusual whisky from Japan, less aligned with the country’s scotch-like tradition of malts and blends and more similar to bourbon, being made mostly from corn. Number 19 in the 2020 Top 20"
346,"<price>54<rating>86<whiskey>Charbay R5 Clear, 49.5%<review>Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA has long been a beloved California craft beer. Charbay distiller Marko Karakasevic liked it so much he made whiskey from it. The Clear (aged 22 months in stainless tanks) sings with hoppy citrus zest and pine notes set in a sweet background. It’s nicely nuanced in the mouth, though, with a creamy body that sparkles with bitter orange and grapefruit floating over understated malt. Preferred over his Doubled & Twisted; this is more sophisticated. "
347,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>Peerless (distilled at Strathisla) 1967, 35 year old, 48.8%<review>Antique gold color. A pleasingly aromatic aroma of dried fruit, floral notes, malt, and light toffee. Medium in body, and slightly chewy. Its flavors are well-balanced, deep, and complex. Toffee, almonds, and sweet malt notes, with interwoven notes of fruit. The palate ultimately dries out with dried fruit, herbs and nuts on the finish. 
"
348,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Infuse Spirits Broken Barrel (Batch 03), 47.5%<review>The nose is sweet and wood-driven, with butterscotch, molasses cookies, toasted pecans, and a faint floral note. Cinnamon, chili pepper, almonds, orange, and candied violets buoy a somewhat thin mouthfeel, all rounded off with sweet floral flavors and subtle oak. Six month old Kentucky bourbon that has been “finished” in stainless steel tanks with French and American oak and oloroso  sherry staves."
349,"<price>48<rating>86<whiskey>2Bar Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Seattle bourbon made using Northwest grains. Aromas of goldenrod, golden raisins, and spicy stewed prunes; a panoply of alluring spices, chocolate, and oak. The palate carries through with similar notes, along with apricot and dark red fruits, but a dusty edge and an excess of tight, tannic green oak hold it back. Chili-chocolate spice, minerality, and lingering fruit on the finish. Impressive complexity, but somewhat woody and off-balance."
350,"<price>2280<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney 40 year old, 51.3%<review>Old Pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. Just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released, offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. The nose is soft and fragrant, with peaches in syrup, toffee, cinnamon, and aerosol wood polish. Early intense orchard fruits on the palate, then nutmeg, cinnamon and black coffee. Long in the finish, with spicy oak tannins and Seville orange. Notably drying."
351,"<price>13<rating>80<whiskey>Rebel Yell, 40%<review>Redesigned label, wincingly generic in looks, even for a bottom-shelf 80 proofer. Whiskey’s quite light in color, and smells young as well: sweet, a wheated bourbon hint of peanuts, and just the faintest hint of wood. Mouth is warm, softly corny, and a little bittersweet on the finish. But that’s it. Just not much going on here."
352,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Delilah's '13' Bourbon, 13 year old, Batch #1, 50%<review>One of the leading bourbon-specialty bars in the U.S., located in Chicago, finally has its own single barrel bourbon. The flavors are nicely balanced, and there’s a soothing, creamy texture throughout the palate. Sweet notes of coconut cream, vanilla fudge, and honeycomb are enhanced by a complex array of more delicate notes of spearmint, green tea, golden raisin, dusty corn, cocoa, and oak resin. This time, “13” is a lucky number. 
"
353,"<price>350<rating>93<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Ghost and Rare Glenury Royal Edition, 43.8%<review>This presents a mellow bouquet of rich dried fruits, peat smoke, baked sugar on puff pastry, and almond butter cups. The chocolate-orange signature note ebbs and flows, mingling with spices and clove, nuts, dried apricot, caramel, vanilla, and baked apple, ending with a frisson of spice and mild smoke. Understated elegance: this whisky is polished smooth as glass."
354,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve Small Batch Single Barrel, 55%<review>Clean on the palate, with honey-kissed citrus, summer fruits, crisp mint, and cinnamon, balanced by creamy vanilla and soft toffee. A solid bourbon that’s nicely rounded and vibrant. It’s very much with the current trend of American whiskeys toward no age statement; youthful and playful in nature, and versatile."
355,"<price>246<rating>91<whiskey>Timorous Beastie 40 year old, 54.7%<review>There should be few qualms about snapping up this aged Highland gem given the blender’s prowess and the generous pricing. Ripe stone fruit, straw, sweet oak, and ground almond on the nose. For its advancing years, it’s quite a ride at full strength; thick, glossy, and mouth-coating with tangy sweet oranges, fudge, and candied citrus. Best sipped neat, it ebbs away with bright orange fruit and buzzy spices. (1,080 bottles) £200"
356,"<price>67<rating>87<whiskey>WhistlePig 10 year old Straight Rye, 50%<review>Regauged into once-used bourbon barrels, this is not the WhistlePig of old. Four years’ finishing in Vermont has toned down the sweetness and high notes, emphasizing a complex, leather/dark chocolate/tobacco spectrum instead. Lavender, violets, and ripe red fruit rise over dusty-dry barn boards, blue clay, and dark rye bread. The spicy rye tones glow with white pepper, while hints of astringent barrel oak keep a slight slipperiness from clinging."
357,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Silver Lightning Moonshine, 49.5%<review>You wouldn’t believe from the nose on this white whiskey that it’s nearly 50% alcohol. Sweet, fresh-milled cornmeal combines with slightly acidic and floral pear, with just a dash of yeast to form an inviting and approachable nose. On the palate it’s equally affable and well-balanced, with sweet corn, crisp pear, and white pepper spice. A nice long finish with a touch of cooling rounds off an expertly-crafted and enjoyable moonshine."
358,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Balcones Peated Texas Single Malt, 63%<review>Subtle and rounded smoke on the nose, balanced by lemon, grilled pineapple, and chocolate-chip cookie dough. A big, tannic, and chewy palate, chocolaty and extremely fruity—hints of Meyer lemon, grilled plums, walnut paste, and five-alarm chili wrapped in a thick, spicy smoke. A fiery finish benefits from water. Their first peated release and it’s a showstopper. (531 bottles; distillery only)"
359,"<price>31<rating>89<whiskey>Cutty Sark Storm, 40%<review>Cutty Sark master blender Kirsteen Campbell has hit the ground running and is playing a leading role in the revival of this iconic blend. Storm is a very different whisky than Tam o' Shanter. The nose is nuanced and light, with orange jelly and citrus juice; the palate is sophisticated, fruity, perfectly balanced, rounded, and gentle, with a high-percentage malt content evident in the mix. The finish is quite short but very more-ish. An amazing whisky for the price. £20 VALUE PICK"
360,"<price>55<rating>82<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Revival, 46%<review>The first widely-available single malt from the revived distillery of Glenglassaugh, Revival comprises spirit from both first and refill casks, finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for a period of six months. Initially a little mashy, with beer-like aromas. Quite sweet and mildly sherried, with developing roasted malt notes, ginger, hazelnuts, and caramel. Leather and insistent spice on the palate, majoring in nutmeg and cinnamon. Straightforward in the finish; spicy and nutty. Probably a crackerjack in another dozen years!"
361,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>GlenDronach Cask Strength Batch 7, 57.9%<review>Like previous releases in the Cask Strength series, this was matured in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The nose offers honey, soft sherry, eucalyptus, and cherry blossom. Supple and sugary on the very approachable palate, with nutty toffee, dark sherry, and dark chocolate-coated cherry liqueurs. Long and spicy, with ripe plums in the finish."
362,"<price>250<rating>95<whiskey>King of Kentucky 14 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight 2020 Release (Barrel No. 3), 65.3%<review>
Intensely fruity to start, with dark cherries, blackberries, and raspberry coulis; there’s also dark chocolate, maple syrup, leather book bindings, and oolong tea, set over a background of baking spice. With water, brown sugar creeps in at the outer edges. Remarkable complexity on the palate: cooked dark fruit, dark chocolate ganache, tea leaf, roasted pecans, maple syrup, licorice, tobacco, and well-integrated spice. The flavor array is seemingly endless, and carries well into a lengthy, warming finish."
363,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>Komagatake Rindo Nature of Shinshu, 52%<review>This young whisky from the Mars Shinshu Distillery was matured in Japanese wine casks. Fragrantly aromatic with perfumed florals, apple blossom, and pastel-colored chalky candy. By way of explanation, Rindo means “gentian,” the mountain flower of Nagano. Its light texture is rather sweet, with caramel, mango, a piquancy of tart oranges, and a little underlying pepper and clove. A snarl of pepper and lingering soft fruits rounds things off. (8,200 bottles)"
364,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Ex-Bourbon Cask, 57.1%<review>This is the pick of the bunch, the whisky equivalent of Fountains of Wayne; an effervescent dessert whisky, which from the first aroma to the final finish is a consistent mix of vanilla, coconut, and overripe banana, sprinkled with icing sugar and cinnamon."
365,"<price>29<rating>82<whiskey>Popcorn Sutton Small Batch Recipe, 44%<review>Made by ex-Dickel distiller John Lunn at the brand's new distillery, a new bottling, new name. “Distilled from grain and sugar.” Smells like clean white dog: warm, ripe melon, alcohol heat, grain. Smoothly drinkable, not hot or astringent. Simple, sweet: melon, cooked grain. Sweeter than vodka, and a bit more flavorful, but otherwise pretty similar. I still don't get the attraction."
366,"<price>92<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Laphroaig) 8 year old, 46%<review>What would you expect from an 8 year old Laphroaig? Iodine, massive peat, aggression? Not here. Rather, there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor, with hints of salinity and tarragon. It builds in heft, and smoke, but there is real balance. Complex already. The palate initially shows muted smoke, and is slightly medicinal, with balancing creaminess. Water shatters this idyll somewhat, as the phenols come out in full force. It depends what side you want. I’d grab some. £60"
367,"<price>4500<rating>93<whiskey>The Last Drop 50 year old Double Matured, 51.8%<review>TLD’s sixth release captivates with dark caramel, Brazil nut, polished oak, cacao, scorched earth, grilled field mushroom, and roasted coffee bean aromas. To sip is to submit to a discombobulating whirl of cherry and jellied black fruits replete with old sherry characteristics, replaced by an unctuous, oily base, torn asunder by seething spices of clove, pepper, and star anise. Ever-changing. Muted exit of dulled spice, browning apple, and eucalyptus. (898 bottles)"
368,"<price>150<rating>87<whiskey>Canadian Club 1950s, 40%<review>After more than 60 years in cask this dignified, old-time Canadian Club flaunts its age with wood and faintly bitter oak tannins. Initially, the nose is closed, then opens into cedar with slightly musty wet paper and just hints of fruit. The fruit is big but undefined on the palate with overtones of brisk Epsom salts, sweet sandalwood, and blistering spices. Teasing hints of varnish, clean wood, and oat flakes linger long into the finish. (Australia only) A$195"
369,"<price>30<rating>91<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage 2010, 43.3%<review>The dance begins in the open barley fields, with a gust of wind catching grain’s natural aromatic presence. Then cherry blossoms and roasted pine nuts tango for dominance, just before the core notes kick in: caramel chew, malt, cornbread, brown sugar, and chocolate, followed by hints of molasses, cardamom, and gingersnaps. As the finish lingers, it’s clear that this is sippin’ whiskey."
370,"<price>500<rating>95<whiskey>Laphroaig 25 year old (2008 Edition), 51.2%<review>The flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crème caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. Long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter — bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)"
371,"<price>130<rating>80<whiskey>The Balvenie Rum Cask 17 year old, 43%<review>Rich and sweet, with toffee, coconut cream, Turkish delight, nougat, and honey. Ripe black raspberries, citrus, and dried spice (vanilla, fennel, and evergreen mint) provide complexity and attempt to balance all the sweetness. A pleasant dram, but I wish there was a little more to prop up all that sweetness. A whisky for those with a sweet tooth. Good with dessert, as dessert, or with a cigar."
372,"<price>104<rating>80<whiskey>GlenDronach 1993 vintage 17 year old oloroso sherry (cask 529), 60.5%<review>This isn’t the easiest to fall for. It’s stewed, swampy, a big, feisty, take-no-prisoners whisky with oxtail soup, spicy tomato and meat broth on the nose, then black treacle, praline, cayenne, and paprika. A rootsy prune juice is part of the finish. Challenging and tough. £67 [Dominic Roskrow]"
373,"<price>152<rating>91<whiskey>Caol Ila Feis Ile Bottling 2013, 56.5%<review>Although aged in refill, then active hoggies, and finally sherry, there’s more smoke
than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. A
note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and
cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and
bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. Water gives greater
integration. You might (just) be able to get this. Do it. (distillery only) £99"
374,"<price>250<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park Loki 15 year old, 48.7%<review>Following on from Thor, Loki is the second release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. Loki has been matured in a mix of sherry and heavily-peated casks. Initial notes of marzipan on the nose, then orange, oriental spices, and chili. In time, yellow plums, vanilla, and floral notes. Soft and sweet on the palate, with pink grapefruit, overt smoke, and a touch of salt. The finish features contrasting barbecue and vanilla notes, citrus, and lots of spice."
375,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>DS Tayman 12 year old Flam Wine Barrel-Finished (Distilled at Linkwood; Cask No. 180803325), 46%<review>
Kosher-certified and matured in a refill bourbon barrel, before finishing in a barrel from Israel’s Flam Winery. Sweet red wine, strawberries and cream, and spicy apple pie on the nose. The palate is voluptuous, with cocoa, Brazil nuts, and increasingly dry red wine. Dark-chocolate raspberry liqueur, oak, and black pepper in the long finish. (1,600 bottles)"
376,"<price>28<rating>82<whiskey>Stillhouse Coconut Moonshine, 20%<review>Of all the flavors you’d expect to see in the moonshine space, coconut is probably the last. Stillhouse’s Coconut Moonshine has a coconut cream nose with a touch of milk chocolate that’s actually inviting. On the palate it’s creamy, chocolatey coconut with just a hint of corn whiskey. The mid-palate lacks some structure, with only a touch of spice. The finish is also a little muted, but damn if they didn’t make a coconut moonshine that isn’t horrid."
377,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Four Gate 11 year old Sherry-Rum Cask-Finished Bourbon (Batch 1), 61.7%<review>Peanuts in the shell, PayDay bars, toasted grain, caramel, butterscotch, purple plums, ginger root, black tea, and layers of spice on the nose. The palate is rich and deep, with dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, blueberry pie, concord grapes, Cherry Coke, ginger, black pepper, and lush chai spices. It finishes velvety and full, with persistent dark fruits, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate. At barrel proof, this is a whiskey to explore: the more water you add, the more depths you plumb."
378,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Garioch Virgin Oak, 48%<review>Glen Garioch spirit is sufficiently robust to cope well with virgin oak, and the nose of this expression yields the bold aromas you would expect from heavily-charred virgin oak maturation: spicy milk chocolate, buttery malt, and ripe peaches. Cocoa, malt, and cloves on the palate, plus lots of wood spice. The finish yields vanilla, ginger, and the inevitable oak."
379,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Big Peat, 46%<review>So which independent bottler comes out in the 'Big' battle of the Islay blended malts? Given this is bottled at a lower strength and it's at a lower price, I'm calling it a draw. The latest batch of this is the best yet, with Ardbeg, Caol Ila, and Bowmore the main components, although there is also some Port Ellen in the mix. So you know what to expect—and it doesn't disappoint. Big AND peaty."
380,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Three Ships 10 Year Old Limited Edition, 43%<review>South Africa’s most established distillery now makes Scotch-style single malt whisky that the country can be proud of. The downside is that it plays it safe, and the flavors on offer are subdued and subtle. That said though, there’s plenty to like here — delicate floral notes including rose, with a rich and honeyed heart, traces of exotic fruits including kumquat and kiwi, wispy smoke, and some cinnamon and paprika. Solid. €47.50 (Not available in the U.S.)"
381,"<price>186<rating>91<whiskey>Swiss Highland Ice Label Edition 1, 58.5%<review>Inside an ice palace located 11,332 feet up the Jungfraujoch, this American oak oloroso butt matured gracefully at a chilly but constant 25°F. A rich vista of currants, red Anjou pears, pecan brittle, musty spices, and saline, with a rootsy, earthy vibe. Flavors climb through intense vanilla, fleeting balsamic notes, a ridge of succulent cherry, sherry, and sultana. Orange and grapefruit at the summit. Drawn-out spice and oak finish, then clove and peppermint. A pinnacle of Swiss whisky making. (981 bottles) CHF179"
382,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Tomintoul 12 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask, 40%<review>Rose blossom, vanilla, and cocoa powder to start, while sultana, walnut, and oloroso notes develop in time on the nose. Soft on the palate, with tingling spices, malt extract, cake mix, raisins, dates, figs, and dark chocolate, all set against relatively dry oak. Dates, prunes, and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish."
383,"<price>120<rating>83<whiskey>Auchentoshan 16 year old, 53.7%<review>A very textural whisky. Incredibly creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, honeyed barley, hay, linseed oil, clementine, and subtle peach. The whisky continues to cling to the palate long after the finish. It’s what you would expect Auchentoshan to taste like, but bolder. A nice whisky, but lacking the polish of the standard 21 year old expression."
384,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Distillery 291 Aspen Stave-Finished Barrel-Proof Bourbon (Barrel #383), 64.8%<review>Carnival notes of candied apple, cotton candy, cherry cola, and a hint of orange peel on the nose, along with licorice, burnt brown sugar, and melted caramel. A deep, rich palate offers notes of dried fruit, toasty wood, dark chocolate, cinnamon spice, and light herbaceousness. Wood char, spice, bitter chocolate, and white pepper complete the finish. Thick, chewy, and remarkably complex for a relatively youthful bourbon. Water or ice recommended. (42 bottles)"
385,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>GlenDronach 15 year old Revival, 46%<review>This expression has returned to the shelves after a three-year absence due to a shortage of stock. Matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers rich sherry, ripe cherries, walnuts, milk chocolate, and marzipan, with a savory hint. Full-bodied, with a palate of spicy damsons, cinnamon, dried fruits, and dark chocolate. The finish is long, with cloves and blackcurrants. Luscious!"
386,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Firestone & Robertson TX Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Led by raw grain and new oak on the nose, it also has aromas of cedar, spiced almonds, green banana, and marshmallow. The palate shows plenty of wood, with pulling tannins, as well as black pepper, vanilla, orange, and bitter almond. It’s more oak and grain on the finish, which fades quickly. Some promising qualities here, but this whiskey needs more time in the barrel."
387,"<price>40<rating>69<whiskey>Rogue Dead Guy American Whiskey, 40%<review>I love Rogue beers, as well as Rogue’s attitude and philosophy. But this whiskey just tastes too immature—harsh, sweet, and one-dimensional. Maybe with some additional aging it might come around, mellow out, and develop, but it has a long way to go."
388,"<price>130<rating>95<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year old (Batch 1), 55.3%<review>Just beautiful. Long, rounded notes of caramel, cinnamon roll, taffy, butterscotch, brisket burnt ends, nutmeg, Jamaican jerk, plum pudding, ginger, light sassafras, root beer, roasted marshmallow, cotton candy, orange peel, raw honey, and pie crust. If it sounds complex, it’s because it is, and the finish just doesn’t quit, giving you a lingering taste of every note."
389,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Bourbon (Batch 018), 55.78%<review>A complex nose that starts out herbaceous and then opens to notes of saddle leather, buttered popcorn, pecans, dark cherry, orange tea, and fragrant vanilla. A rich, chewy palate offers vanilla cream pie, lemon, blackberries, corn muffin, and chocolate-covered coconut, balanced against some drying oak, an herbal note, and dried leaves. The finish is a long, balanced ride of chocolate, cinnamon, and tobacco leaf. A rich, classic bourbon."
390,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Jefferson’s Reserve Twin Oak Custom Barrel, 45.1%<review>This nose is all dry, earthy oak, tightly wrapped in rawhide, but underneath lurks plenty of sweetness, like overripe bananas, with the slight bitterness of citrus oils or orange pekoe tea adding balance. Pleasing coffee and mocha flavors also emerge on the palate, but the oak feels poorly integrated, with a green-stick quality. Finished for 4 months in a custom grooved barrel. (42,000 bottles)"
391,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection (distilled at Old Pulteney) 1994 vintage (Cask #06/125), 45%<review>Finished in sauternes wood. I really love how the appetizing notes of Pulteney marry with the sweet notes of the sauternes wine cask. Light-medium in body, but good viscosity. Fresh brine throughout, with honey-drenched melon fruit, pineapple in syrup, citrus, and a hint of cotton candy and lightly toasted marshmallow. A delicious marriage of two high-caliber drinks categories."
392,"<price>42<rating>84<whiskey>John Myer New York Straight Wheat Single Barrel, 45%<review>Soft and sweet; ripe apricot, honeyed porridge, and sweet vanilla take the lead, with a palate that elicits warm peach cobbler sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. There is lots of freshly-sawn oak apparent throughout, but ample fruit keeps this whiskey juicy right through a pleasantly spicy finish. Fruit forward, smooth, and lovely; a real eye-opener for a whiskey of 100% soft white winter wheat. 375ml"
393,"<price>11000<rating>96<whiskey>Bowmore 40 year old, 44.8%<review>Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick) "
394,"<price>72<rating>87<whiskey>Port Charlotte Scottish Barley, 50%<review>Smoky, yes, but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach, hot sand, wood smoke, and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. In addition you get olive oil, preserved lemon, and eucalyptus. The palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. Water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda), while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45"
395,"<price>101<rating>88<whiskey>Elements of Islay Pl1 (distilled at Bruichladdich, Port Charlotte style), 60%<review>Part of an ongoing series, and the first appearance of Port Charlotte. This ain’t shy. Assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)"
396,"<price>85<rating>85<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 20 year old, 45%<review>Situated between siblings Barterhouse and Old Blowhard in flavor profile. Firm spice, botanicals, dried fruit, and a kiss of honey rest on a bed of caramel, along with resinous oak, leather, dark chocolate, and a hint of tobacco on the finish. Lovely nose, but there's substantial oak on the palate. The sweeter notes make an effort to balance the oak, but the oak still dominates. For these who like drier, spicier bourbon."
397,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Doc Swinson’s 13 year old Flagship Series Sherry Cask-Finished Bourbon (Barrel No. 005), 45%<review>The nose is lightly tropical, with notes of oak, pine, herbs, and orange peel. A buttery mouthfeel, and a palate that offers almond, butterscotch, chocolate fudge, caramel, and oak tannins, along with spice and black pepper. The finish has notes of salted peanuts as well as peanut butter, which sweeten to flavors of rich chocolate with a hint of marshmallow. Full-bodied, sometimes jagged, but with a spicy, nutty finish"
398,"<price>178<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 (Batch 2), 52%<review>If you like warm chocolate ganache sprinkled with cocoa beans, dark waffle cones, praline, and brisket bark, then this is for you. A brief flicker of chocolate, smoke, cherry, peppery spices, and chili flakes move aside for a smooth medley of dark fruit juiciness and sweetened char notes. The strident call of chocolate on nosing goes unreciprocated on the palate. A long, satisfying, deep finish of pounding spices. A worthy successor to the first batch. (417 bottles) £123"
399,"<price>80<rating>95<whiskey>Redbreast Cask Strength 12 year old (Batch B1/17), 58.6%<review>The latest release pits plum, damson, fruitcake, and rosehip against wild, untamed pot still spices straining at the leash. Clove vociferously trumps raisin as the mouth-drawing power is realized; spices deflect off the tongue’s surface like sparks off an anvil. As its grip slackens, the fruit ripens, bruising slightly, yet sweetening deliciously, and vanilla pod, toasted stave, and cinnamon bark emerge. I swear you feel more Irish with every sip. Editors’ Choice"
400,"<price>335<rating>91<whiskey>Chichibu Ichiro’s Malt On The Way Japanese Single Malt (2019 Release), 51.5%<review>Drawn from bourbon casks, refill chibidaru quarter casks, and mizunara-head hogsheads, this has barley, dried apricot, finely ground pepper, and sugared apple on the nose. Wafting peat smoke aromas are accentuated by dilution. Incredibly fruity with plenty of body, the initial apple, pear, and spike of pepper are overtaken by golden syrup, vanilla, pastry, candied fruits, and fruity desserts. Stick with cask strength: Water releases gooseberry sharpness and quells the spices. (11,000 bottles, 288 for U.S.)"
401,"<price>610<rating>92<whiskey>Samaroli Ferry to Islay 2017 Edition, 55.1%<review>Seashells, brine, warm toffee, peat smoke, chocolate bars, sun-crisped seaweed, and dry aromatic spices, with augmented smoky notes if you leave your glass for ten minutes. Sweet honey, spun sugar, lemon, Edinburgh rock, and shimmering spices; a hard-core Islay at this strength and a terrific offering of fruit, peat smoke, citrus sweetness, and warming chocolate. Mouth saturating finish with juicy citrus and spices on the tongue. A rhapsody on peat."
402,"<price>320<rating>94<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 5), 56.5%<review>A superbly balanced whiskey with huge spices meeting vanilla head on: a perfect complement between the American and Irish oak contributions. It has a softer body, with lemon, vanilla, and meringue in creamy custard sauce, but then the spices go off like a rocket, and as they glitter across the palate, there are glimpses of chocolate, coffee, and singed oak."
403,"<price>130<rating>90<whiskey>Port Charlotte OLC:01 2010, 55.1%<review>Shoreline aromas, with lime, caramel, and sweet peat. Mildly medicinal, with coffee grounds. The palate offers Jaffa oranges coated in earthy peat smoke, with pipe tobacco and black pepper. Licorice, cocoa powder, dried fruits, brine, and drying peat in the finish. (30,000 bottles)"
404,"<price>160<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Supernova 2015 Release, 54.3%<review>Apparently this is the final Supernova release and the Ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. Although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote, then sootiness which, in turn, mingles with seaweed aromas. The peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish, and dried grasses. Farewell."
405,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Waterford Single Farm Origin Rathclogh Edition 1.1, 50%<review>
Orange and grapefruit aromas, with rosewater, vanilla cream, bergamot oil, and dry barley notes, though the nose also detects the high alcohol and some youthful notes. The flavor coalesces around clove and pepper, but en route there are sweet barley cereal notes, chocolate, and malt. After a prolonged swarm of spice, the finish has malted milk and old chocolate. (U.S. Exclusive; 13,000 bottles)"
406,"<price>503<rating>89<whiskey>The Golden Age Blend, 44.3%<review>Take a parcel of Macallan, Glenrothes, and Tamdhu all aged over 40 years, season lightly with gently peated Bunnahabhain and North British grain whisky and what do you get? Golden sultanas, linseed oil, orange blossom honey, butterscotch, drying nuttiness, and cedarwood. Blending has beneficially enhanced the three sherry-casked malts. It’s juicy and sticky, rhubarb and damson jams, oak tannins, and a little burnt note as the power swells. Cocoa, chocolate, and lingering oak to finish. (210 bottles) £350"
407,"<price>325<rating>83<whiskey>Teaninich, 1996 vintage, 55.3%<review>Matured in a “rejuvenated American oak” cask. “ Tropical fruit” is the operative descriptor here. Bananas in cream, honey-kissed citrus (lime, clementine), papaya, mango, a hint of coconut, green tea, and gentle vanilla. Soft finish. Rather exotic. Almost tries too hard to be cool. Distinctive, but I could tire of it sooner than the others here. (246 bottles) £200"
408,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Kentucky Owl 11 year old Straight Rye (Batch 2), 50.9%<review>The vanilla and oak-driven nose offers layers of stone fruits, golden raisin, tropical fruit, and citrus zest, along with hints of espresso, violet, and fresh herbs. On the palate, this is so dialed in! Laser-like in its delivery of sweetness and spice, it rings clean and bright, and simply sizzles with candied ginger warmth before the finish pours on cocoa and nutty flavors. Tastes wonderfully mature, yet full of vigor."
409,"<price>140<rating>90<whiskey>Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 30 year old, 40%<review>Sherry finishing influences, from leather satchel, maraschino cherry, floral blossoms, and deep orange notes to a pinch of Chinese Five Spice and buttered ginger loaf. Medium bodied, with a malt content of 75%, it riffs around an orange theme, at times quite sharp, with pith, some bitter grapefruit, more ginger, and herbal strands. Lively spices flicker across the tongue throughout the long finish as the citrus seeps away."
410,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Old Pulteney 12 year old, 43%<review>The only survivor from Old Pulteney’s core range shake-up of 2018, this has been matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. The nose is delicate, with almonds, honey, and floral notes. Malt and toffee on the palate, with spicy oak and a hint of brine. The medium-length finish is nutty, with wood spices."
411,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Tanner’s Creek Blended Bourbon, 42.5%<review>It begins with flowers, cardamom, fresh-cut walnut wood, and mint. Notes of fruit, pomace, applesauce, pineapple, and vanilla-iced strawberries take over, but smoke, pear, and apple dominate thereafter. A shorter than expected finish presents hints of chocolate, candied corn, and more smoke. Very nice for punches."
412,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila, 12 year old, 43%<review>Like the Clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue, it is nice to see Diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of Caol Ila here in the U.S. (after being available in the UK for many years now). My suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from Scotland. This is a splendid Coal Ila. It is wonderfully vibrant. Understandably, the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke, but there's so much else going on here, too: smoked olives, seaweed, salt and pepper, all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge. Lingering smoke, olives, and seaweed on the finish."
413,"<price>70<rating>77<whiskey>Penderyn “Peated” (12/2009 release), 46%<review>My feelings here are the same as for the Sherrywood: it comes across as younger and less mature than the original Madeira wood finish version. This one has some peat smoke in the mix. Malty sweet (with some graham cracker, nougat, and hints of butterscotch), peppered with light smoke. Quick, lightly smoky finish."
414,"<price>58<rating>91<whiskey>Armorik Sherry Finish, 40%<review>Sticky short ribs from the churrascaria, black pepper, allspice, and a little leather. This is a richly savory whisky with a substantial mouthfeel that’s never chewy. It was matured for 4 years in bourbon wood, then finished in oloroso sherry casks, creating a palate of figs, mixed peel, dried chili flakes, mocha, and whole black peppercorns. Perfectly weighted, right down to the ristretto finish with whole wheat digestive biscuits. Bold, audacious, and voluptuous."
415,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Eagle Rare Single Barrel 10 year old, 45%<review>Antique amber in color. Deep, mature aromas of toffee, wood spices, mint and leather. Medium in body. The flavor begins sweet, with honeyed vanilla and toffee notes, evolving to dried fruit and spices, and then becoming dry, woody and a bit hot. Long, dry finish. 
"
416,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Spirit Works Straight Wheat, 45%<review>Made from 100% organic red winter wheat, aged 2 years, 1 month. Much lighter on the nose than its rye stablemate (see above); notes of butterscotch and green tea, with a bit of oaky strength. Flavors of cracked grain and light stone fruits shimmer across the tongue; the oak stays high in the mouth. Finish is light and long, moving from grain to wood at the end. Interesting and delicate for a 2 year old."
417,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>High West Bourye (Batch #1), 46%<review>This is a blend of straight bourbon and two straight rye whiskeys: thus the name. Very interesting indeed. But how does it taste? It’s clean, crisp, and quite vibrant (especially on the nose). The rye note is evident throughout. It starts out more like a high rye-content bourbon, with the molasses, caramel, coconut cream, sweet corn, and honey-kissed fruit marrying nicely with the dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, brisk mint). But then on the latter half of the palate, the rye really kicks in. The whiskey gets bold, the rye becomes intense (almost piercing), with a dried spice finish. Some whiskeys are even keeled throughout. This one is more of an adventure. Not complex enough for “classic status,” but a very distinctive, enjoyable whiskey."
418,"<price>38<rating>89<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, Fall 1990, 44.5%<review>Style: Bourbon Color: Honey gold Aroma: Subtle. Clean. Delicately spicy, with notes of vanilla, mint, citrus, and golden raisin. Palate: Like its aroma, with a pot pourri of spices on the finish. 
"
419,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Laphroaig 15 year old, 40%<review>Brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and, in the vein of other 15 year old expressions, is somewhat restrained. Rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin, sautéed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing."
420,"<price>92<rating>92<whiskey>Box 2nd Step Collection 03, 51.3%<review>For those interested in transparency, the detail Box releases about each bottling is staggering; e.g. 5% of this whisky was matured in medium-toasted Hungarian virgin oak. This one is for Islay fans, showing more peat than smoke; nutty, and replete with barley notes. Approachable at cask strength: melon, bright citrus, tropical fruits, burnt orange, and plenty of pepper. We hear the first U.S. release from Box is imminent. (8,291 bottles) 743 SEK"
421,"<price>165<rating>90<whiskey>Old Potrero Hotaling’s Single Malt Rye 16 year old, 50%<review>Soft and subtle aromas, but bolder on the palate. A base of creamy caramel is peppered with cinnamon heat, vanilla, brittle mint, and dried fruit. Firm oak grip on the finish balances the sweetness. Very enjoyable."
422,"<price>43<rating>90<whiskey>Redwood Empire Lost Monarch Blend of Straight Whiskeys, 45%<review>A blend of 3 to 5 year old straight rye and 4 to 12 year old straight bourbon. Although the nose is a bit reticent, once it opens up, what is revealed is pure delight: orange blossom, iced tea, dark berries, lemon oil, pine, cinnamon, nutmeg, and leather. Fruit and spice enjoy a dynamic interplay on the palate, with orange, cherry, blueberry, and grape, shot through with cedar, cinnamon, and sturdy oak. The medium-length finish is supple and pretty: dark chocolate, toasted pecans, and well-integrated oak."
423,"<price>615<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1990, 43%<review>The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection, named Bond House No.1 after the 19th century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990. Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Mandarins, honey, and vanilla on the floral nose. Very smooth on the palate, with malt, vanilla, more honey, and milk chocolate orange. Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish."
424,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Longmorn 16 year old, 48%<review>Longmorn may be slightly better known, but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in Japan, where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. This bottling shows it in its lushest guise, with masses of caramelized soft fruits, banana, cream toffee, and chocolate. The palate shifts between raisin and plum. Elegant. "
425,"<price>58<rating>86<whiskey>Chivas Regal The Chivas Brothers’ Blend 12 year old, 40%<review>Intended to recreate the spirit of James and John Chivas, this blend uses high proportions of Longmorn and Strathisla malts. The nose has green apples, peaches in syrup, blended honey, and oat flapjacks. A soft and light opener of orange sherbet, melon, and dried apple. Dilution yields a delicious creamy texture with more assertive citrus flavors and bitter peel showing by the end. A distinctive character from the regular 12 year old, but this should be regarded as an equal. £40"
426,"<price>24<rating>88<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. Original, 40%<review>Triple distilled classic containing a blend of pot still, malt, and grain whiskeys, this layers aromas of spice over toffee, creamy banana, light vanilla, sharp green apple, and zested limes. Aromatic spices quickly beat the established flavors of green fruits, followed by vanilla fudge, malty notes, peppercorn, and even a little oak char. This moreish, well-structured whiskey retains its creamy mouthfeel throughout the active, spicy finish. Best Value"
427,"<price>185<rating>82<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore (Edition 01.1), 5 years old, 63.5%<review>This is the new super-peated (131 ppm phenol barley) Bruichladdich. “Super-peated” seems almost like an understatement. Ultra-peated, perhaps? Intense smoke on the nose and palate, with notes of freshly tarred road, cigar smoke and ash, licorice root, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and smoked seaweed. Struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit, honeyed malt, brine, and soft vanilla. Long, smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. A very invigorating whisky. It’s a few years younger than the other ultra-peated whisky, Ardbeg Supernova. I think if they were both the same age, I would like them equally (and score them equally -- I gave Supernova an 89). But the Octomore does taste a little green, which was not noticeable in the Supernova. I think Octomore will be very good in another five years, and amazing in another ten. Let’s hope the lads at Bruichladdich are holding some stocks back."
428,"<price>25<rating>93<whiskey>Old Overholt Bottled in Bond Rye, 50%<review>

This veteran rye never managed to ascend from the bottom shelf. Perhaps a new generation of enthusiasts couldn’t get behind the staid name, or found the price too low to believe. But having persevered for over two centuries, Old Overholt’s time has come. This new version (indicated by its red cap) eliminates chill-filtering, resulting in greater flavor and depth. Aromas of Christmas spice cake, cinnamon, apple, and toasted grain lead to a mouthful of berry fruit, with seductive allspice, cacao, and walnut notes. What’s old is new again! Number 12 in the 2020 Top 20"
429,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>The McGibbons Provenance (distilled at Port Ellen), 19 year old, 1982, 62.5%<review>Amber color. Full aroma of peat smoke, with interwoven notes of seaweed, burning leaves, leather, and fudge. Medium in body, with a slight oily texture. Powerful and evolving in flavor, with great depth. It begins somewhat sweet up front with notes of vanilla and toffee, followed by a peat smoke explosion. Lingering notes of seaweed, oak, salt and pepper add complexity. Finally, the whisky becomes slightly sweet again, with lingering smoke. 
"
430,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>The Antiquary 21 year old, 43%<review>Consummately blended from more than 30 different whiskies, this has chewy Highland toffee, freshly-baked banana muffins, shelled walnuts, and faint chocolate orange notes. A smooth, full mouthful of blossoming orange, thick malt, heather honey, dabs of espresso, and milk chocolate. The malty Horlicks flavors prevail to the end with some attractive, shimmering spices. Note the higher strength here, though the 45% malt content is consistent across the range."
431,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Balblair 1995, 46%<review>The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter."
432,"<price>110<rating>86<whiskey>GlenDronach 1991 vintage, 18 year old, sherry puncheon (cask 3182), 51.7%<review>The variety between this series of single casks is quite extraordinary. This has a soft and light nose with some mint and liqueured fruit, and a big, rich, and impressive taste with anise and menthol, glacé cherries, and traces of mint. The finish is warming and full, with the mint and cherry theme carrying through to a slightly peppery conclusion. £71 "
433,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Smoky Black, 40%<review>Peated Glenturret lies at the heart of Smoky Black, but where will the master blender find her smoke when the distillery is sold? Contemporary bottlings are rich, warming, and comfortingly smoky, with chocolate, malt, cocoa, burnt fruitcake, and baking spices. Medium-weighted blend with malt, chocolate, and bourbon biscuits, interwoven with smoke, then cherry, baked apple strudel, and chocolate desserts. Dry smoke, ginger, pepper, and dark chocolate to finish."
434,"<price>15000<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1968 (distilled at Caol Ila), 52.5%<review>Coal smoke, brine, machine oil, and herbal notes on the nose of this 50 year old, along with a hint of menthol and ultimately, floral notes. Dark berries on the palate, bitter orange, plus sea salt. The finish is long and slightly smoky, overtly oaky, with black pepper notes. (50 bottles in U.S.)"
435,"<price>86<rating>87<whiskey>Cotswolds Founder’s Choice, 60.9%<review>Dedicated to Dr. Jim Swan, who encouraged Cotswolds Distillery to shave, toast, and re-char red wine barriques, this has developed aromas of cherry, dried goji berries, rose petal, vanilla cake mix, butterscotch, and muted spices. It still feels young at this mighty strength. Warm red fruits of cherry and strawberry slam into a distortion of allspice, clove, and tongue-searing alcohols, which are quelled eventually by sweet notes of creamy toffee and mint. (3,000 bottles) £65"
436,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Clear Creek Distillery 3 year old McCarthy’s Pot Distilled Oregon (Batch W18-01), 42.5%<review>A blast of peat bonfire starts on the nose, before moving into more subtle peat on the palate. Here it creates a delicate overlay to notes of vanilla, toasted marshmallow, peaches and cream, dried red fruits, and pepper. The finish offers length, more dried red fruits, peat, and peppery spice, with an earthy note of char at the end. Delicate, refined, and balanced, particularly in light of its relative youth. (6,192 bottles)"
437,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Longmorn) 1992, 49.7%<review>Longmorn always has this fruitcake thing going on and this is no exception. A sherry hoggie  helped provide sultana, cake mix, grilled almond, rhubarb puree, and a little cigar box. The palate is very fruity, with light Darjeeling-like tannins, then red fruits. It becomes nuttier as it moves and needs water to add ripeness to the stone fruit base. Highly recommended and extremely well priced. £80"
438,"<price>200<rating>81<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 41 year old (distilled at Invergordon, Cask No. 15517), 50.2% <review>Some of these older Duncan Taylor grain whiskies are very individualistic and exciting. With others, the wood has gotten the best of them (Grain whiskies are light in body and thus vulnerable to excessive oak aging). This one, fortunately, gravitates more towards the former, with a rather reserved oak influence, given its age. A bit tight on the nose. Rather sweet too, and somewhat viscous. Notes of vanilla, crème brulee, marzipan, caramel-coated popcorn, brown sugar, toasted coconut, and subtle pineapple and papaya. A gentle dried spice finish rescues the whisky from all the sweetness."
439,"<price>370<rating>93<whiskey>Port Ellen, 30 year old (2009 Release), 57.7%, <review>Port Ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. This old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age, but is still holding up nicely. It’s clean, with no excessive oak, and a soft, sweet maltiness for balance. Earthy and rooty at times, with tarry rope, beach pebbles, leafy smoke, bourbon barrel char, black licorice, lemon peel, and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). Long, smoky, lightly briny finish."
440,"<price>28<rating>84<whiskey>Rowhouse Spirits Poitin, 48%<review>100% pilsner malt fermented with Belgian ale yeast. Not unaged whiskey; a grain spirit meant to be drunk without aging. Sweet-tart, intense aroma of unripe cherries, plums, white pepper, and a bit of caramel. Smooth on the tongue with a roll of heat, grain comes forward and dominates the fruit, though it balances at the finish. Clean, even interesting. More poitin should be like this. (Pennsylvania and New Jersey only)"
441,"<price>98<rating>81<whiskey>Deveron 18 year old, 40%<review>Formerly marketed as Glen Deveron and now rechristened the Deveron as part of owner John Dewar & Sons’ Last Great Malts initiative, this 18 year old is the oldest of three releases on offer.  Oily on the nose, with apricots, sultanas, and toffee. Dark spices merge with sweet apples, walnuts, and a hint of chewing tobacco on the palate. Ginger and pepper in the lengthy finish."
442,"<price>112<rating>88<whiskey>Bakery Hill Cask Strength Peated Classic Single Malt, 60%<review>If you've tasted any Connemara Irish peated whiskey you'll know and love this. This whisky is the most improved in the Bakery Hill range, so that now with water the peat weaves patterns round the standard green apple, honey, and vanilla heart of the malt. Australian peat is very different to that of Scotland, and here it is wispy, smoky, and sweet. A$115"
443,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Kentucky Straight (2019 Release), 52.5%<review>Elegant and supple, as befits a whiskey aged 11 years. The maturity shows on the nose, which has Concord grape skins, leather, sassafras, iced tea, chocolate, pecans, and varnish. Big dark fruit flavors, cola spices, ginger, cooked cherries, dark chocolate, and generous oak; a touch of water brings out pecans. The lengthy finish draws out cola, dark chocolate, leather, and pepper. Sip slowly; it continues to evolve in the glass. (13,200 bottles) Collectibles"
444,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>St. George Spirits Breaking & Entering, 43%<review>American whiskey takes an unusual direction with this blend of straight bourbons from Kentucky and Tennessee, straight rye from Tennessee, and malt whiskey made by St. George Spirits. On the nose, stewed plums and apricots, orange gumdrops, almonds, earthy grain—spilled wine in the garden. A resinous and hoppy palate, with poached pears, cooked ginger, lemon, white pepper, and milk chocolate-covered almonds. Lemon pith and mild oak on the finish."
445,"<price>158<rating>91<whiskey>Jura One and All, 51%<review>This limited edition 20 year old assemblage was matured in bourbon barrels, sherry casks, Cabernet Franc casks, Cabernet Sauvignon casks, and Pinot Noir barriques. Rich and sweet on the nose, with marzipan, apricot jam, and fresh pineapple with vanilla custard. Silky, with ginger, cherries, and caramel on the palate. The finish is long, with black pepper, licorice, and slightly tannic oak. (5,000 bottles) £120"

Rich oak on a nose that offers butterscotch, vanilla ice cream, and sugared pecans, along with red fruit, baking spice, and black pepper. The palate reveals more vanilla, as well as almonds, honey, toffee, and gingerbread. Chocolate, baking spice, pepper, leathery oak, and tobacco leaf complete a long, sinewy finish that shows its maturity well."
447,"<price>70<rating>96<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 63.3%<review>Very similar to last year’s release. (A good thing, since it was wonderful!) Very smooth, with layered sweetness (toffee, fig cake, nougat, maple syrup), dark fruit (black raspberry, blueberry), cinnamon, and polished oak on the finish. A whisky of elegance and sophistication. (Editor's Choice)"
448,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Chivas Regal Extra, 40%, <review>A new oloroso-forward Chivas positioned to split between the 12 and 18 year olds? I got this. Refined and inviting nose of lemon pith, black fruits, and Kola Kubes. The velvety texture is wonderfully smooth, redolent of an apricot custard Danish, lime zest, raisin, currant, mixed peel, and walnut, with a growing bitter-lemon note. Quite unique finish, like sucking on lumpy Spanish lemons speckled with spices. (LA, NY, Miami, Chicago, Northern California, but will go national)"
449,"<price>40<rating>78<whiskey>White Owl Spiced Whisky, 40%<review>A subtle essence of vanilla and restrained crispy oak are lathered in rich butterscotch, then seasoned with scorching pepper and a pinch of rye spices. Surprisingly, it’s not overly sweet. Smooth creamy custard coats your mouth, mellowing otherwise assertive spices. The dram finishes in pulling citrus pith with touches of peppery heat, tingling ginger and cloves, and fading hints of ripe cherries. Faint but distinct whiffs of barrels remind us that this colorless liquid is whisky. (Alberta only) C$40"
450,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>The Balvenie Madeira Cask 17 year old, 43%<review>A harmonious marriage of fruit and spice. More balanced than last year’s sweet Rum Cask release. In fact, this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies I’ve tasted this year. Bramble, ripe nectarine, caramel apple, honeyed vanilla, and golden raisin, spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft (for Balvenie), lingering, warm, dried spice finish."
451,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Vapor Boulder Bourbon, 42%<review>Pretty fruit gets swept up in distinct anise and fennel-bulb aromas, with hints of mint and quinine, backed by vanilla. Very soft, creamy, and rounded on the palate, the peachy stone fruit comes nicely balanced with oak, sweet vanilla, and glimmers of nutmeg and clove spices before the cocoa powder finish. Well-constructed, smooth, and easy-drinking with a pleasant persistence of fruit."
452,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Rye Finished in Vermouth Barrels, 47%<review>A young (“minimum of 6 months”) rye, finished in California vermouth barrels. The results are polarizing; I’m in the “intriguingly tasty” camp. The nose: rye spice with herbal depth and fruit wreathing. The whiskey hits first, but herbal vermouth is right behind, putting more body on the spirit and cranking the finish in an unexpectedly dry, almost bitter direction. An aperitif whiskey, begging to play with cocktails, or even ice, but good neat. Craft whiskey continues to experiment."
453,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 67.3%<review>Distilled in 2003. Weller is the wheated bourbon in the Collection, where wheat replaces the rye found in most other bourbons. The sweetness is balanced nicely by a solid peppering of oak spice. Notes of toffee, maple syrup, fig, black raspberry preserve, cinnamon, and vanilla. Lingering oak and polished leather on the finish."
454,"<price>104<rating>85<whiskey>Broger Distiller’s Edition, 58.7%<review>A rich, sumptuous nose of deep, oxidized sweetness derived from storage in 128-liter madeira barrels, this cask strength Broger has wafts of fallen orchard fruit, gooseberry fool, young rhubarb stems, and lime curd. It’s thick, chewy, and syrupy, wallowing in flavors of toffee apple, deep vanilla, and stewed fruits, though with a dash of water, some brown bananas and coffee cream notes peek through. A fabulous nose, but the palate is pulled toward an overripe, fruity profile. (164 bottles) €84"
455,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>10th Street Distiller’s Cut Peated, 44%<review>Made using cuts that emphasize its peat and malt notes, this starts off with a nose of brine, seaweed, and iodine, but there’s a captivating, tempting tropical fruitiness too. On the palate, that tropical note shows up fleetingly as blueberry and pomegranate, with peat continuing to commandeer the ship into an ashy finish of coffee bean, black pepper, and dark chocolate.

Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml"

American Single Malt, 50%<review>Herbal and peppery on the nose, offering dill, licorice, guava, and green banana, as well as a hint of mint and black cherry cough medicine. The mouthfeel is somewhat tart, with burnt espresso beans, bitter chocolate, and a note of toasted almond. A long finish of caramel and bitter chocolate, as well as charred, bitter hoppy notes melds with a sweet, honeyed and syrupy taste and texture. A fascinating flavor progression."
458,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Booker’s 2018-02 “Backyard BBQ,” 64.4%<review>Typical of Booker’s this bourbon shows lots of concentration and muscle, oozing with caramel and maple syrup, with hints of lavender and bouquet garni. Flavors explode on the palate, with more herbal complexity, root beer barrel candy, green almond, black cherry, and a big rush of dark, bitter-sweet burnt sugar and caramel. Lovely baking spices and lots of toasty oak linger on the long finish. The youngest barrel in the blend is just over 6 years, 2 months of age. Editors’ Choice"

Red currants and warm peat, ginger, and vanilla on the nose. Initially, juicy fruit on the palate, but soon drier than expected from the nose. Dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. Relatively long in the finish, with gentle spices. Ultimately, sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8,000 bottles)"
460,"<price>159<rating>92<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2016, 40%<review>This year’s liquid missive from head distiller Brian Nation has a nose of caramel, macaroons, and beeswax with green, grassy notes. The first sip evokes barley sugar, which grows into a citrus glow, nourished by some green oak and a little white pepper. It has lovely poise this year, effortlessly lighter on the tongue than the 2015 or 2014 creations. The conclusion is slightly nutty with soothing oak."
461,"<price>1900<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 21 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 1997 (distilled at Macallan), 53%<review>Here’s an accomplished Macallan, not a leather-lashed first-fill, but the nose is still replete with prominent sherry notes accompanied by marzipan, ripe mango, apricot, violin rosin, wood spices, and dried lavender. This has a beautiful weight with sweet, candied orange and active spices. As tropical fruits appear, there is chocolate, clove, pepper, and a slight nuttiness, with vanilla and baked fruits on the finish."
462,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Tattersall American Single Malt, 55%<review>Opening with fresh grain aromas, it soon develops to show complex cinnamon, clove, chai, black tea, dried orange peel, and smoked salt; delicate pastry notes also appear. The palate is rich, roasty, and hot without water, offering dark chocolate, dried chiles, barbecued brisket, cacao nibs, charred nuts, and peppery spice that starts as a small flame and builds into a burn on the warming, chocolaty, ashy finish. (1,200 bottles)"
463,"<price>70<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan Amber, 40%<review>Soft fruits are to the fore here; think of cooking green plums, fruit syrup, a hint of sultana to add to the sweetness, and then a hint of beeswax. There’s even a little of Macallan’s occasional earthiness, here akin to the damp sand floor of a sherry bodega. This is the transition point in the range with a similar weight to Gold but greater sweetness and the beginnings of Macallan’s mysterious savory edge. Have neat, with water, or ice. £45"

Blended from imported whiskies along with Chichibu, the component whiskies in blue label are at least 10 years old, but often much older. The aromas tease with barley sugar, smoked venison, aromatic pan-roasted spices, peppercorn, and smoked paprika. Pepper and root ginger pummel sweet orange flavors of sherbet and Creamsicle. The citrus sweetness sees off the hefty spices, leaving the mouth awash with creamy orange peel notes and tropical fruits."
465,"<price>63<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Journey, 46.2%<review>This was inspired by Stewart Laing’s childhood journeys by steam locomotive from Glasgow to Speyside with his father. Hunter Laing’s blended malt includes contributions from Blair Athol, Teaninich, and Clynelish and raises toffee sauce, dried banana chips, and spring foliage, with a fringe of fresh mint. You can appreciate the cool, clean taste; ripe banana and chocolate-dipped fudge blooming into late notes of mocha, ginger, and chocolate mousse. Dry finish of ginger cookies and espresso. All aboard! £40"

Hints of butterscotch become fruity, with tinges of vanilla as the nose opens. A luxurious creamy palate develops peppery spices that dissolve into a sweet fruitiness with a glowing warmth in the back of the throat. A dynamic dram with lovely hot spices that advance, then retreat. The long finish is mildly sweet and spicy. Editors’ Choice"

The nose is sweet, with tropical fruits, nutty spices, almonds, orange marmalade, and worn leather. The orange theme continues on the luscious, lively palate, with spicy toffee, cinnamon, vanilla, and honey. Drying and lightly spiced in the finish. A dram that deserves to be better known.

468,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>Teeling Small Batch Grain Whiskey, 46%<review>The Teelings were responsible for giving us the quite wonderful Greenore, which moved up the gears until it hit stunning at 15 years old. This, I suspect, is back to the start and is a work in progress. But it has all the right parts even if it isn't firing quite yet. Its nose is industrial and a tad sappy, but the taste makes up for it: sweet, light, with smoky ashtrays and almond pulp."
469,"<price>65<rating>80<whiskey>Cooper River Rye, 43%<review>Rich copper in color, following just 55 weeks in a 17-gallon barrel at low proof (106.2), this whiskey is caught between youth and ambition, as flavors of leathery oak, earth, dried apple, and dates emerge to meet green twigs and briar, and some musty basement. Generous and broad-shouldered, this rye aims high, with solid structure and robust spice, but is overwhelmed by dusty, bitterly tannic oak on the finish."

They made it a duty free staple and no wonder. This is classic, old-style Canadian whisky. Seamlessly integrated spicy white pepper, refreshing bitterness, and succulent butterscotch, all burnished with clean oak, cinnamon, cloves, and simmering ginger. It has the creamy body of crème brûlée brightened by a sprinkling of blackstrap molasses. C$22"

The nose presents light peat, ozone, and faint medicinal notes, becoming saltier and spicier with time. Bracing. Woodsmoke, kippers, grapefruit, and lime on the palate. The finish is sweet, with receding smoke."

Full flavors of tangerine, Bosc pear, salted pistachio, white pepper, dried ginger, and mint are diminished only by the light body. The finish is particularly satisfying, but a little more heft would make it shine. (Total Wine & More)"

The nose has hard, dry peat, cold charred logs, and heather twigs, but enough creamy sweetness to keep it buoyant. It shimmers and twists on the tongue, showing shades of light and dark. Nuts, treacle, licorice, and raisins emerge, though the structure shows its youth. Dry, sooty finish. €60"

A rich palate offers balanced spice, banana, cherry cola, strawberries and cream, chocolate, and baking spice. The finish is smooth, with light earthiness, tobacco leaf, and fragrant oak, followed by brown sugar, coconut, chocolate, and spice at the back."
479,"<price>110<rating>78<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Rare Auld (distilled at Glen Moray) 1986 24 year old, 55.6%<review>Touches of acetone and magic marker/solvent suggest that there’s precious little cask involvement going on here. Pleasing enough, with lime jelly and kiwi fruits, and a little whiff of sweet oak, but it’s very understated. In the mouth, it performs in a nutty way but doesn’t seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. There is some horchata and brazil nut, even a mashy note, but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70"
480,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Glann ar Mor 1an Gwech 14, 46%<review>Only four first-fill bourbon barrels have been disgorged for this year’s unpeated release, so be quick. Vanilla frosting, marzipan, white pepper, and coconut snowballs emit from the glass. The mouthfeel has a satin sheen, with flavors of sweet honey, peach syrup, orange segments, ground pepper, and some almond nuttiness. It holds its poise as it gently dilutes, comforting like a warm blanket over your taste buds. A few drops of water produce a rounder, sweeter experience. €60"
481,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Single Barrel, 50%<review>The second release in the new Taylor line by Buffalo Trace, and the first single barrel offering. Similar in personality to the first release (a small batch offering), but a shade darker in color, flavor, and personality. A bit more intense, too, with more mouthfeel, and not as demure. A fair trade-off. Starts off sweet (rummy, burnt dark fruit, fig cake) then becomes dry, with dried spice, tobacco, toasted oak, and leather. Very exciting and distinctive."
482,"<price>235<rating>86<whiskey>Highland Park Freya 15 year old, 51.2%<review>Freya is the third release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection; unusually, it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. It fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. The nose is sweet, floral, and heathery, with pineapple, mango, and a background earthiness. Finally, vanilla and milk chocolate. Smooth on the palate, with passion fruit, and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. Subtle peat, char, and a hint of licorice in the finish."
483,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>The Temple Bar Signature Blend, 40%<review>This blend is full of bold flavors: sweet barley, oranges and lemons, fudge, and pastel-colored macaroons. There is plenty of body, with vanilla, brown sugar, strands of citrus, fudge, and spice. It seems slow to warm up, the flavors a little lost for a few seconds before it gets its act together. Lengthy finish of buzzy spices, lemon peel, and caramelized brown sugar."
484,"<price>49<rating>84<whiskey>Double Barrel Talisker/Craigellachie, 46%<review>We don't see very much Craigellachie as a single malt because most of it goes into blending, and from that we might draw the conclusion that it's not particularly distinctive in its own right. If it plays a role in this mix it's a submissive one then, because after a not altogether enticing nose that has gooseberry, green salad, and some prickly chili pepper, the palate is all about a mouth-coating big pepper hit that stays long into the finish. €40"

Incredibly rich aromas of fruitcake, toffee, dates, roasted nuts, with a hint of cocoa powder and other spices. Rich and thick in body.

Blueberries and raspberries baked into a sweet pie crust, with pistachio, spiced almonds, and marzipan on the nose.

Though light, it finishes with a satisfying richness of berry candy and polished oak. (Total Wine & More)"
488,"<price>165<rating>95<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s 35 year old, 50%<review>Oh, the glory of used cooperage. Woody notes begone—let time slowly breathe life into what began as almost neutral, high-proof corn spirit. Creamy spice, barley sugars, peach syrup, dry grasses, and ancient barn boards. Incredible complexity, yet so tightly interwoven it achieves oneness. One hundred points until a campfire bursts onto the finish and consumes five of them."
489,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection 1838 Style White Corn Bourbon, 45.2%<review>Fresh-shucked sweet corn on the nose, a wisp of hot clove spice, some fresh grassiness; a clean aroma. True on the palate, with a bit of fresh cob as well, and firm oak. Lean and a bit leathery in the Woodford style, but lighter in the mouth; is the lightness from the white corn? I like this; I tend to give Woodford a bit more latitude in these essays."
490,"<price>10<rating>79<whiskey>Peach Mist, 35%<review>Canadian Mist with flavor and sweetener. Boozy but fresh peach, vanilla, and sugar nose; smells like a fresh, juicy peach cobbler; where's the whisky? Very much dessert-like in the mouth, sweet, full, but not cloying; points for that. Finish is peach candies, vanilla, and finally some whisky notes. Even at 35%, I'd like a lot more whisky character here; otherwise, what's the point? Still, head and shoulders above Southern Comfort's flavor experiments."
491,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Glenrothes 1995, 43%<review>This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur. "
492,"<price>560<rating>89<whiskey>Jura Camas an Staca 30 year old, 44%<review>The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. Vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices. "
493,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Benjamin Prichard’s Single Malt, 40%<review>The American craft whiskey movement has produced some unique riffs on classic spirits. Here we get a classic Irish-type whiskey made in Tennessee and aged in small, 15-gallon barrels. It’s all lush Irish on the nose, with caramel, green apple, dark chocolate, oak. On the palate the oak from the small barrel overtakes caramel apple with its smoky barrel char, sawdust, and clove spice. An interesting idea, but perhaps better realized in larger or used barrels."
494,"<price>30<rating>91<whiskey>Old Overholt 114 Proof Straight Rye, 57%<review>A reluctant nose, with aromas that are difficult to discern, although a few emerge: white Necco wafers, cinnamon Red Hots, leafy herbs, and—with water—blueberry jam. The palate is chock-full of mint candy, even mint toothpaste, plus black pepper and tannic oak; water brings out more blueberry notes. The lengthy finish, laced with tobacco, has more mint and oak, black pepper, and dark fruit."
495,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Breuckelen Project No. 1 Bottled in Bond Wheated Bourbon, 50%<review>The nose begins with notes of cinnamon, soft oak, cardamom, white pepper, and a hint of new wood. The palate shifts to a subtle blend of orange and vanilla. Water reveals fresh raspberry, along with notes of fresh herbs, roasted almonds, tobacco leaf, and more new wood. The finish is powerful and complex, leading with vanilla and more nuttiness, as well as red fruit and roasted pineapple."
496,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Balcones Lineage (Batch SML20-2), 47%<review>

As American single malt ascends, Balcones shows its leadership with this triumphant offering. It’s bursting with tropical fruits—kiwi, mango, guava, jackfruit—buttressed by undercurrents of cinnamon, dried chiles, blueberry muffins, and nuts. Those juicy ripe fruits remain intense on the palate, two-stepping with cocoa powder, barrel char, roasted pecans, and black pepper; the dance sweeps into a lengthy finish of grilled pineapple, mocha, and tobacco, tapering off into bitter chocolate and oak. Balcones is putting both American single malt and the state of Texas on the map. Number 17 in the 2020 Top 20"

The cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young whisky. £45"
498,"<price>69<rating>84<whiskey>66Gilead Crimson Rye, 47%<review>The second whisky from this Canadian craft distillery is a blend of three barrels of 100 percent rye whisky. Maturation for 3½ years in once-used red wine barrels has integrated distinct ripe fruits into the spiciness of rye grain. Youth is obvious in the earthy, malty elements, and the peppery heat, and there are distinct suggestions of clean blue clay. Its full body, rich flavors, and the fruit-spice balance speak well for the future of whisky from 66Gilead. (Canada only)"

The well-balanced nose is terrific, with jasmine-scented candles, banana, peach pit, Banoffee pie, and polished oak, becoming lush and fruity with blackberry, green apple, and fragrant spices. In the swirl of aromas, there’s harmony. Light bodied with satsuma segments, cotton candy, milk and cookies, dried fruits, and fruity candy toward the end. The low filling strength may be the cause of less influence of the mizunara cask over the 24-month finish. (2,004 bottles)"
500,"<price>15<rating>73<whiskey>Canadian Club Dock No. 57 Blackberry, 40%<review>When they say berry, they mean berries: baskets of blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries, until suddenly the palate veers off into grape popsicles. This is one sweet, unabashedly faux-fruity potation, but other than traces of oak, not much whisky flavor remains. Still, in the right hands it could be a lot of cocktail fun. Rather than serving it in a whisky glass, a dram or two on French vanilla or coconut-milk ice cream is genuinely scrumptious. "
501,"<price>275<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glentauchers) 1989, 55.2%<review>This example of the little-seen Glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character, which is in the green grassy camp. This verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad, with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. This mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue, although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. I’d happily have a couple."
502,"<price>135<rating>85<whiskey>Lagavulin Triple Matured Edition, 48%<review>A very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat, figgy, dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat, only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. With water, there’s balsam, tar, dried seaweed, and fabric Band-Aid. This is repeated on the tongue, with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes, but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80"
503,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Auchentoshan American Oak, 40%<review>American Oak is new to the Auchentoshan core range in 2014 and is the first release from this Lowland distillery to be matured solely in first-fill bourbon casks. An initial note of rosewater, then Madeira, vanilla, developing musky peaches, and icing sugar. Spicy fresh fruit on the palate, chili notes, and more Madeira and vanilla. The finish is medium in length, and spicy to the end."
504,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Tiger Snake Sour Mash, 43%<review>It’s not bourbon, but the mashbill contains corn, rye, and malted barley sourced from western Australia. It has zippy vanilla, whole hazelnut, hints of rye spiciness, overlaid with taffy candy and fresh fruit. Syrupy sweetness drenches the taste buds, peeling back honeyed layers to reveal vanilla, melon, ripe banana, citrus, and tropical green fruits, diluting to delicious coconut creaminess. A moreish small batch whiskey with a finish of custard cream biscuits that sticks it to those boys in Tennessee. A$130"

506,"<price>23<rating>82<whiskey>Jameson, 40%<review>Meet the undisputed driver of the Irish whiskey resurgence. The nose is light, with baked apple strudel, toasty staves, and hints of the bourbon and sherry cask influence. There are discernible pot still elements contributing a fruity character and plenty of weight. This dominant triple distilled whiskey is smooth, sure, although that characteristic improves noticeably up the range. Expect Braeburn apples, raspberry, strawberry, currants, and mixed peel, with a short finish of cinnamon spice and a dull fruit note."
507,"<price>70<rating>96<whiskey>Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve, 40%<review>Perhaps the finest Canadian whisky I have ever tasted. Creamy and seamless from beginning to end. Gently sweet, with orange creamsicle, marzipan, sultana, praline, maple syrup, and a hint of coconut macaroon. Forty Creek whiskies have always been very good, but none have ever had the right stuff to reach classic status. Until now, that is. An outstanding, very distinctive whisky!"
508,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Exclusive Malts Speyside 25 year old 1989 Cask #3,942, 48.8%<review>Exclusive Malts doesn't disclose the source distillery, which doesn't matter when you’ve got a whisky that’s a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced, with honeyed apple cider, gingerbread cookie, and baked apple. In the center of all this is rancio. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish, which is long and flavorful. Great balance, integration, and flavor. What more can you ask for? (U.S. only)"
509,"<price>54<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Peat Chimney, 46%<review>Imagine your nose hovering inches above well-dried peat, then throw in salted nuts, brittle toffee, and an intensification of vanilla pods. This feels more rounded and balanced than earlier bottlings and is the better for it. Warm, sweet caramel, juicy orange, and lime zest are shot through with peat, the rising smoke driving you back while pepper and ginger give close support. The most improved of the Wemyss three, but a bit more heft in the composition wouldn’t go amiss. £37"
510,"<price>74<rating>87<whiskey>Two Brewers Classic Release 16, 43%<review>Kiwi, apricots, and other tart fruits precede dry wood and malt on the nose. The sweet, lush, and weighty palate delivers white pepper and mild oaky tones, quickly turning very hot before fading to sweet barley sugar. Butterscotch notes turn watery for a second, then hot and fruity with malty herbal tones and sweet baking spices. Finishes on fruit, malt, bandages, and grain dust. Quite complex. $98 CAD"
511,"<price>49<rating>87<whiskey>Ragtime Bottled in Bond Straight, 50%<review>New York Distilling Co.’s first bonded whiskey, which also conforms to the voluntary Empire Rye standards. It’s herbaceous and grain-driven on the nose, with licorice, dried mint, brown sugar, peanut oil, and buttered pecans. The dry palate is remarkably light, with flavors of black pepper, walnuts, licorice, mint, orange, and tart cherries. Oak, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate on the finish."
512,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Talisker Distillers Edition, 1992 vintage, 45.6%<review>Matured in amoroso casks. The amoroso softens Talisker’s fiery personality and adds a gentle sweetness not normally found in Talisker. There’s a lot going on here-notes of toffee and dark chocolate, layered with bitter orange, seaweed, kippers, smoked nuts, damp peat, and kalamata olives, finishing with a peppery glow. Not an every day dram-one has to be in the mood for a whisky like this. (With sausages during brunch, perhaps?)

513,"<price>250<rating>89<whiskey>Octomore 10.3, 61.3%<review>This “single field, single vintage, single malt,” was distilled in 2013 from Islay barley, peated to 114 ppm and aged in first-fill American whiskey barrels. The nose offers sweet, fragrant woodsmoke from logs on an open fire, with milk chocolate, salted caramel, and orange. The fragrant smoke carries over on the palate, with pears, melons, and developing barley sugar. Dark peat and licorice in the finish. (24,000 bottles)"
514,"<price>61<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Velvet Fig, 46%<review>Who could refuse a blend of single malts wholly matured in oloroso sherry casks? They’ve perfectly bottled the aroma of molten tiffin: the chocolate, cocoa, biscuit, raisin, dried dates, and walnut are all here. Sipping brings on chocolate, coffee, malt, ginger, nutmeg, and dried fig. There’s no slow reveal, it pretty much lays its cards on the table immediately; rather than developing flavors, they extinguish one, by one leaving a finish of cocoa and maltiness. (6,000 bottles) £40"
515,"<price>164<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Ginger Spice (distilled at Glenrothes) 1988, 46%<review>Glenrothes always has a spicy element, but this example ups the ante considerably and, true to the label, it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander, a hint of green grass, and even a little bite of jelly babies, alongside black currant leaf. Rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant, with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. Uplifting and good. £107"
516,"<price>850<rating>91<whiskey>GlenDronach 25 year old Grandeur (batch 7), 50.6%<review>Matured in oloroso sherry casks. Confident plum, prune, and raisin notes on the early nose, with developing ripe cherries, sherried fudge, and resin. A slightly earthy undertone. Viscous in the mouth—very sweet—with developing tingling spices, then darker fruit notes emerge, with licorice and plain chocolate. The finish is long, with enduring dark chocolate and fruity spice. (1,180 bottles)"
517,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Usquaebach An Ard Ri Cask Strength, 57.1%<review>This 2016 release in its ceramic flagon entices you with lemon, soft fruits, honey, digestive biscuits, and taffy candy. It’s dense and weighty; oozing with flavors of barley sugar, caramel, sweet oak, and some mature orange peel characteristics underpinned with ginger and pepper. Profoundly long, sweet finish pricked with bitter orange and spice. One of those great drams that you can happily imbibe at cask strength without dilution. (2,000 bottles)"
518,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Amrut Bourbon Single Cask #3441, 60%<review>We can thank Bangalore’s climate for the arrival of this 2009 distillate. Honeycomb, vanilla shortbread, crispy tart shells, graham crackers, and malt extract make for an attractive proposition. It tiptoes onto the tongue, but within seconds you get the thundering sense of its full strength approaching. Dried fruits, wood spices, malt loaf, chewy caramels, shortbread biscuits, with Horlicks malted milk on the finish. A dash of water triggers a sensation of plump raspberries dipped in chocolate. £59"
519,"<price>320<rating>91<whiskey>Glen Scotia 25 year old, 48.8%<review>Maturation took place in refill bourbon casks before a final 12-month period in first-fill bourbon casks. Lemon, ginger, pine resin, and a hint of sea salt on the nose, then banoffee pie develops. Luscious on the palate, with subtle spice, a touch of ashy smoke, and principally big orchard fruit notes. Drying in the lengthy finish, with a wisp of smoke, brine, and peppery oak. Glen Scotia at its characterful best.£250"
520,"<price>330<rating>92<whiskey>Macallan 18 year old Double Cask, 43%<review>Deep notes of wood polish on the floral nose, with toffee and a whiff of cloves.

521,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Cadée Deceptivus Bourbon, 42.5%<review>Soft oak, brown sugar, and a back note of iron start things off, followed by hints of corn muffin, red candy, and a subtle note of dried red fruit. The palate leads with vanilla rice pudding, a light note of orange peel, milk chocolate, and green apple. It’s creamy, light, and sweet, with baking spice enlivening the chocolate. The finish is lengthy, ending with vanilla icing and a buttery note."
522,"<price>210<rating>87<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Glen Spey), 1974 Vintage, 46%<review>Although this distillery is operating, it remains one of the hardest Speyside whiskies to find. This is unfortunate. A fairly straight-forward whisky-pleasingly malty and somewhat viscous on the palate, with some grassy notes. The extra years, with this particular bottling anyway, have allowed the whisky to blossom, become a little more intriguing and heavier. Along with malt and grassy notes, I’m picking up citrus fruit (especially on the nose), toffee, nuts, freshly ground roasted cocoa beans, nougat, and vanilla fudge.

523,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Tullibardine 1988, 46%<review>Tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years, but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age, matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. Malt, vanilla, carnations, and peaches on the full nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, with toffee, lively spices, and more herbal notes duly appearing. The finish features cereal, spice, and white chocolate. £47"
524,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Paul John Nirvana, 40%<review>What I love about this is that it’s fresh and fruity with plenty of zip. The nose has hard candy, fresh laundry, floral notes, apple, and peach puree. A fruit medley with nectarine, pear, and satsuma, followed by vanilla, lime, almond, and five spice, becoming more rounded, with apple and fudge and a spiced citrus finish. Best Value"
525,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Kilchoman Loch Gorm (2020 Edition), 46%<review>Warm leather on the nose, slightly prickly spice, damsons dipped in iodine, red berry fruits, barbecued meat, and underlying earthiness. The palate is oily, offering dry, fruity red wine notes, cinnamon, raisins, prune juice, wood embers, and discreet peat smoke. The finish dries, with black coffee, dark berries, and toasted oak. (1,920 bottles for U.S.)"
526,"<price>69<rating>82<whiskey>The English Whisky Co. Chapter 14 Limited Edition, 46%<review>Unripe pears, honeycomb, strawberry millefeuille, and vanilla custard. A light and pleasant expression, but it’s not the kind of complex dram that will hold your attention all night. This batch of unpeated 5 year old single malt from St. George was disgorged from just four American standard barrels, and the taste consists of waxy lemons, vanilla cream, and banana splits, with a growing caramel presence. A dry finish of light spices and sweet lemon. £45"
527,"<price>84<rating>92<whiskey>Redbreast 12 year old Cask Strength (Batch B1/18), 56.2%<review>This batch heightens the fruitiness of apple, orange peel, dried strawberry, and peach over potent spices on the nose. Strawberry and raspberry flavors revel in the oily richness, then crescendo to a pot still spice storm that rages in the mouth like a swarm of bees. Long, spicy finish with vestiges of fruit and toasted oak. Thrill-seekers’ whiskey, if you dare."
528,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Bruichladdich Islay Barley 5 year old, 50%<review>Since its reopening eleven years ago this year, Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced. £38"

A bold, complex nose of peat, smokehouse, dried leaves, and lime. Bitter chocolate and raisins on the palate, and a finish of blackberry coulis, chocolate, and pepper. A tour de force from this young distillery. (U.S. exclusive; 329 bottles)"
530,"<price>422<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Deveron 30 year old, 40%<review>Initially, the nose is very different than that of the younger Glen Deverons, with brown paper and malt vinegar. Becoming buttery, with coconut ice and citrus fruit. Ultimately, a caramel note reminiscent of the 16 year old (see below). Rich and waxy on the palate, with dark berry fruits, almonds, vanilla, and treacle. Sweet and sour. The medium-length finish offers green berries and a hint of aniseed. Real depth of flavor and individuality here. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain.   £250/700 ml"
531,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Mortlach 15 year old Six Kingdoms, 46%<review>The ninth and final release in Diageo’s Game of Thrones series was aged in first-fill sherry-seasoned casks and finished in bourbon barrels. Vanilla and toffee, plus spicy oak on the nose, while the full sherried palate yields dry fruit, spicy citrus notes, almonds, more vanilla, and caramel. The leisurely finish presents wood spices and Jaffa oranges."
532,"<price>471<rating>87<whiskey>Talisker 30 year old, 45.8%<review>As part of a rebranding of the entire Talisker range, Diageo has brought its Special Releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold, reduced in strength to 45.8%. Sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt, milk chocolate, and dry, crumbling peat. Citrus fruits (notably lemon), licorice sticks, black pepper, and scorched wood on the palate. Dry and oaky in the lengthy finish, with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300 "
533,"<price>216<rating>92<whiskey>The Five Distinguished and Rare 39 year old, 51%<review>This is massive. It even pours thickly, as the aromas spill out of the glass: rich stewed apple, dry oak, a passing digestif trolley wobbling with dark sticky bottles, and currants on the tummy of a gingerbread man. There is a rum-like quality to the thick texture that lands squarely on the palate, bursting out with sweet apple and brown sugar. It hardly loses its grip after swallowing, dissipating almost imperceptibly against the approaching oak flavors. Special indeed. (330 bottles, WoodWinters Wines & Whiskies only) £150"
534,"<price>1100<rating>93<whiskey>Bruichladdich 1984, 43.7%<review>This 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. It offers a nose of canned peaches, dates, marzipan, and a hint of milky coffee. Rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach, pineapple, and mango, with vanilla and nutty oak. Slowly drying in the finish, with warming spices. Sometimes good bourbon casks are all you need. (3,000 bottles)"
535,"<price>74<rating>85<whiskey>Balcones Brimstone, 53%<review>Oddly smoky nose that grows on you — this is blue corn smoked with Texas scrub oak — you can smell burnt oak and light wreathings of corn. The first jolt is jalapeño without the heat, followed by a cornbread rush with a very light riff of smoke. The smoke builds to the finish and curls nicely around the corn. A very different whiskey experience; one I could get to like (could I try some with a plate of brisket?). "
536,"<price>35<rating>73<whiskey>Virginia Black American Whiskey, 40%<review>Sourced whiskey from MGP, it’s fairly muted with hints of dill, oregano, basil, sawdust, hay, and mint. Then vegetal, cherry cough syrup, and candy corn notes over cola, maple, and oak. Traces of baking spices appear just before sweet syrup over an extremely short finish. Although many notes appeared, none were particularly pronounced."
537,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Springbank) 1965 34 year old, 46%<review>Antique amber color. Ripe, fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut, marshmallow, and almonds. The sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose, but the Springbank ""brine"" character still manages to fight through. Full bodied, with a soothing texture. Huge flavors with great balance and depth, consisting of exotic fruits, complex wood spices, brine, and coconut. Long, lingering satisfying finish."
538,"<price>49<rating>88<whiskey>Freeland Spirits Bourbon (Batch 2), 46%<review>This bourbon is finished for 5 months in pinot noir barrels from Willamette Valley’s Elk Cove Vineyards. The nose offers toasted spicy oak, orange Creamsicle, clementines, and lime leaf, but is also herbal, with light notes of dill and white pepper. Oak-driven on the palate, spicy and nutty, with citrus oil and espresso. A smooth finish offers dark chocolate, roasted almonds, coconut, and tobacco leaf, and becomes fruitier with water."
539,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>The other whiskeys in the Antique Collection get all the attention but, for the past few years, Eagle Rare 17 year old has been very impressive. This year’s edition features vanilla taffy, caramel almonds, maple syrup, and candy corn, with balancing notes of polished leather, summer fruit, a dusting of cinnamon, mocha, and soft mint. The flavors are nicely integrated with good depth. A rock-solid effort that will not disappoint."
540,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>New Deal Distiller’s Reserve Oregon Straight Bourbon, 40%<review>Makes a pleasant first impression as sweet apple and corn notes meet summer flowers, Cracker Jack, and fresh oak. The palate shows a pleasingly oily texture, as butterscotch candy and roasted peanuts come with hints of spice and orange peel. The nutty finish shows toasted almonds and caramel."
541,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Leopold Bros. 4 year old Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Pencil shavings, Popsicle stick, vanilla, cinnamon, toasted coconut, and marshmallow on the nose. The palate is led by dry oak, integrating orange, cinnamon, nuts, iced tea, and apple, leading into a sweet finish. There are some interesting flavors here, but the barrel seems to be overpowering them."
542,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Pinhook Bohemian High Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 57.25%<review>Pinhook’s first bourbon distilled at Castle & Key Distillery, following an earlier release of a rye. The palate is smooth despite the high proof, with tart notes of orange peel. Water smooths it out, with some pepper and spice emerging against restraining oak tannins. Aged 2 years and 10 months, it has a young and dry profile, but some pleasant spice and earthy notes on offer."
543,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Kilchoman Spring 2011 release, 46%<review>A marriage of 3 and 4 year old whisky aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, with the 4 year old portion being finished in oloroso sherry casks. Among the best of the Kilchoman releases to date. The first-fill bourbon packs a flavor punch, while the sherry softens, rounds, and adds complexity. Barrel char, burnt raisin, boat dock, and tarry rope, softened by caramel and enhanced with notes of tropical fruit. Surprisingly mature for its age and very distinctive. "
544,"<price>69<rating>83<whiskey>66Gilead The Wild Oak, 47%<review>From a bourbon-style mashbill matured in new Missouri oak, this first whisky from 66 Gilead salutes Wild Oak farm, where contented cattle dine on the distillery’s spent grains. Dry grain, gray weathered wood, sea breezes, caramel, and soft, earthy, woody notes become vanilla, saltwater taffy, cherries, and fruit punch, with herbal hints of celery. It’s hot and spicy with sizzling pepper and searing ginger over a barrelhouse woodiness. Young, but not rough, with a long, peppery finish."
545,"<price>60<rating>82<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Glenrothes), Cask #1082, 12 year old, 1994 vintage, 46%<review>Very much in the Glenrothes style, with a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Very perfumed and fragrant, too, with flavors of assorted dried fruit, vanilla, golden raisin, citrus, and honey that dry quickly on the palate. A suggestion of peat lingers in the background and on the whisky’s clinging finish. 
"
546,"<price>500<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfiddich 26 year old, 43.1%<review>Pale straw in color, and while it is clean and fresh, it’s also very delicate, with elderflower blossom, dusty florals, and a freshly-starched linen note. All rather discreet, shy even, but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. Water adds a perfumed, green note. As the nose suggests, it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt, with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. Tread cautiously, lest you scare it."
547,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>J.J. Corry The Gael, 46%<review>Chapel Gate whiskey aims to resurrect the lost art of the Irish whiskey bond. This delicious debut is built around parcels of aged single malt and grain sourced from County Louth. Fresh hay, floral blossoms, comb honey, dry spice, oak, a crate of whole lemons, and growing spices. Lemon sherbet, clean vanilla, and a peppery grunt resolve flavors of rich barley sugar and a hot pepper finish. (7,000 bottles)"
548,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch B519), 61.1%<review>Keeps true to this award-winning whiskey’s oak-driven style, with aromas of lead pencil, leather, and fresh sawdust, balanced by dense fruitiness and tinged with herbal licorice and eucalyptus. Brawny and tannic on the palate, it’s reminiscent of sucking on a cherry Popsicle stick, balancing sweet caramel, brown sugar, and molasses with persistent oak, cedar shingle, clove, and paprika. A rustic, powerful, and robust bourbon."
549,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey> Uncle Nearest 1856, 50%<review>Slow-roasted corn, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg, and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter, salt, and pepper. Then, it’s apple cider vinegar, deep-fried mushrooms, and Nutella. Fried pie dough and hints of chocolate appear before a medium finish that has a hint of toffee."
550,"<price>10<rating>82<whiskey>Black Velvet, 40%<review>Standard bottling benchmark. Smells sweet, caramel and toffee, with some alcohol heat and a slight medicinal twang. Strong caramel flavor (is that where that rich amber color came from?), not particularly deep or complex, but not hot or flawed either, leading to a gentle sweet finish. Not bad at all for a mixing whisky.  "
551,"<price>109<rating>88<whiskey>Glengoyne 18 year old, 43%<review>This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish. £70"
552,"<price>17<rating>84<whiskey>Ellington Reserve 8 year old, 40%<review>Ellington has the creamy, sweet, and ultra-smooth mouthfeel down pat. Canada likes its mixing whisky to bite a little, but America prefers a silky smooth glide right down the gullet. Ellington Reserve certainly delivers with its rich, almost oily aura that springs to life with spicy-hot white pepper and newly-split clean firewood. Caramel and brown sugar underscore distinct notes of perfumed, candy-coated licorice amidst fragrant orange blossoms and flat lemon-lime soda. C$17"
553,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Tobermory) 21 year old, 51.2%<review>An aged island dram to mull over during the distillery’s lengthy closure for essential upgrades, this brims with lemon sherbet, summer fruits including cantaloupe, and Bartlett pears poached in cream. Tangy citrus balanced with ginger and peppery spice, cocoa notes, and black bun make for a lively mouthfeel. Creamy fudge and Jaffa cake rule once the spices die back. An enchantingly delicate orange sorbet flavor appears when diluted."
554,"<price>62<rating>91<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 10 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 2008 (distilled at Tobermory), 53%<review>Highly approachable at cask strength with lemon biscuits, oak shavings, kiwi, vanilla essence, and breezy maritime notes. The palate unpacks lemon meringue pie and green melon, with an undercurrent of spice. Vanilla and caramel build atop a growing disquiet of peppery spice, with hints of peppermint to finish. This works superbly as a drinking experience without diluting."
555,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Clyde May’s Alabama Style 110 Proof American Whiskey, 55%<review>The nose begins with notes of earthiness and tobacco, followed by banana, crème brûlée, cherry hard candy, and cocoa powder. With water, fragrant apple, clementine, coconut, bubble gum, and cotton candy notes emerge. The palate is also candied, with cherry, raspberry pastilles, grape jelly, milk chocolate, and cracked pepper. On the finish, it’s chocolate cream pie, almond, and a halo of tobacco leaf. A veritable chocolate factory, balanced against a tart espresso note and tobacco."
556,"<price>85<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Scotia 15 year old, 46%<review>This 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. Relatively reticent on the nose, with light vanilla. Becoming more aromatic and spicy, with tinned apricots in syrup. Medium-bodied, relatively dry, with ginger, oak, and cloves, before a touch of milk chocolate appears. The chocolate darkens. Aniseed and perpetual spice."

Glencraig was the name given to the single malt made using Lomond stills at Glenburgie Distillery. The nose leads with linseed oil, then coconut, malt, dark chocolate fondant, and tiramisu. Oily on the palate, with sweet orange, cocoa powder, and ginger. The finish dries very slowly to dark chocolate and light wood spices. (110 bottles, 12 for U.S.)"
558,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Penelope Four Grain Straight Bourbon (Batch 2), 40%<review>Fresh, green, and earthy: bell pepper, jalapeño, unshucked corn, and lime leaf, as well as cacao nibs, cedar cigar box, and cinnamon. More peppers on the palate, this time dried and smoked, along with roasted pecans, chocolate, nuts, bitter oak, and a hint of tobacco. The finish is short and light; a little more proof would go a long way."

Rattray (distilled at Highland Park) 19 year old 1992, 48.8%<review>Many of the independent H.P. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks, and, like this one, exhibit creamy vanilla, honeyed malt, and citrus. I’m also picking up some more subtle heather, brine, coconut, and nougat. This one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance, with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)"
560,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>New Riff Backsetter Peated Backset Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Rye, 50%<review>Deep, complex, and ever-developing flavor that doesn’t quit. The nose shows cherry Robitussin, leather sofa, old books, polished oak, and a refined sweet nuttiness, like Jordan almonds. Chewy and oak-driven on the palate, with cherry cough syrup, roasted pecans, dried ginger, white and black pepper, and ample oak; flavors of burnt ends and burnt marshmallow hint at the peat—which comes from the use of peated malt whiskey backset—but could just as easily be mistaken for barrel char. The peppery, ashy, chocolaty finish keeps going and going. (2,250 bottles)"
561,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Clynelish) 1990, 53.2%<review>Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80"
562,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch B517), 62.1%<review>Rich and bold, it’s loaded with caramel notes that range from macchiato to salted caramel chews. Then complexity sets in, with brown sugar, vanilla cake batter, cinnamon-dusted molasses cookies, candied pecans, brown-sugar butter, and cornbread. The key here is that each note appears with that initial caramel richness and follows this to the long, warm, and satisfying finish with a hint of spice."

There’s light peat, campfire, and fragrant meadow on the nose, along with sweeter notes of vanilla coulis, applesauce, marzipan, pears, and cinnamon-spiced almonds. The palate offers polished oak, clementine, grilled apple, and almond pudding. A lengthy finish adds brown sugar, grilled fruit, dark chocolate, espresso, and white pepper."
565,"<price>179<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing (distilled at Glen Mhor) 30 year old, 50%<review>This veteran Old Malt Cask offering was distilled in Glen Mhor, Inverness during 1982.

A good mouthfeel, with the fruitiness following on from the nose, joined by spicy toffee, a wisp of wood smoke, and old oak. The finish is medium to long, slightly resinous, and citric with a dash of cocoa and a hint of peat.  £115"
566,"<price>61<rating>79<whiskey>Glenrothes Peated Cask Reserve, 40%<review>A 1992 ‘Rothes finished in a peated cask, this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. Behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. It has surprising intensity. It’s all very clean and fresh, but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. Like the recent Glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. Maybe if you want smoke, you should peat the barley. Who’da thunk it? £42"
567,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>Jim Beam Distiller’s Masterpiece Sherry Cask Finished, 50%<review>“Extra-aged” bourbon finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The third Distiller’s Masterpiece release, the previous two being over a decade ago. The PX sherry is certainly evident, with its lush, dark fruit (raisin, prune, ripe plum), marmalade, and
layered dark sugars (toffee, molasses, maple syrup). A peppering of spices (cinnamon, allspice, vanilla) and dry, resinous oak round out the palate. Certainly a mood whiskey. Perhaps with a cigar after dinner? (distillery only)"
568,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Zinfandel Aged Bourbon, 18 year old, 45%<review>Aged in Zinfandel barrels for eight years after spending ten years in new charred oak. Quite similar in flavor profile, but with more oak influence (as would be expected) when compared to its younger brother. The oak spices and resinous textures are more prominent on the nose and palate in this whiskey, and they linger on the finish, which ultimately becomes slightly leathery and tannic. Still, an entertaining, intriguing whiskey. (But read between the lines-buy the younger expression.)

569,"<price>47<rating>89<whiskey>Canadian Club 20 year old, 40%<review>Every now and then, Canadian Club dips into its massive reserves to release a longer-aged version of its core 1858 edition. After an initial hit of toffee, a well-defined woody framework supports signature Canadian Club pruney notes, clean grain, and peppery rye. Brown sugar, unsweetened cereal, and hints of barn boards in the middle follow an inviting crispness, enhanced by mild oak tannins and accented by floral top notes. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
570,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Rebel Yell Single Barrel 10 year old (barrel 4744359), 50%<review>Caramel and earth on the nose, with freshly tilled soil, flowers, and oak just before an explosion of caramel, vanilla, allspice, and fruit. It really grows on you, with a buttery mouthfeel that presents cinnamon, honey, cornbread, marzipan, pecan pie, granola, nutmeg-dusted pumpkin pie, and a slight hint of candied ginger. Finishes long, with rich caramel. Quite tasty."
571,"<price>30<rating>82<whiskey>Dry Fly Port Finish Wheat, 43%<review>Wheat whiskey, finished in huckleberry port barrels, showing a deep reddish blush, purple-pink around the edges. The fruity richness of the portwood is subdued, but present, and lays across everything else in the nose. Things become less one-dimensional on the palate, and the sweet broad grassiness of the wheat lightens the portwood influence somewhat, but it comes back in the finish. It’s a decent combo, but a bit of a one-note song. Price is per 375ml."
572,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Dry Fly Straight Wheat, 45%<review>A fragrant nose offers scents of orange blossom, cinnamon, lemon peel, vanilla, and balanced oak. The palate has a drier orange peel note, as well as peanut shells, cinnamon, ginger, and bitter chocolate. Quite dry on the back palate, where the wood influence becomes much more prominent. The finish is light, with bitter chocolate, some nuttiness, tobacco, dried herbs, and drying oak. Pleasant spiciness, cinnamon, and citrus overall."
573,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Rossville Union Barrel Proof Rye, 56.3%<review>The aroma is a mélange of sweet goodness, with violet candies, figgy dried fruits, and molasses cake that almost evoke a cane-like rum sweetness, as tobacco leaf, leather, and sassafras notes add depth. It’s a real roof burner on the palate, broad and mouth coating, offering a big blast of spices, cocoa powder, tropical fruits, and vanilla before the wood and minty herbs drive it to the finish line."
574,"<price>135<rating>89<whiskey>Amrut Intermediate Sherry, 57.1%<review>Aged in bourbon casks, then sherry casks, then finished in bourbon casks. An interesting (and original?) approach, but is it worth all the effort? I think so. The sherry notes are clean, not cloying, and there’s plenty of oak resin on the palate for texture, and to balance the sherry’s sweetness. Liqueur-ish fruit (orange, raspberry, cherry, caramelized peach), along with a good peppering of dried spice (vanilla, ginger, cinnamon, anise). Distinctive resin on the finish props up the rest of the flavors. "
575,"<price>61<rating>83<whiskey>Singleton of Dufftown 15 year old, 43%<review>Diageo’s Singleton range is its answer to the problem of how to build a global single malt brand when each distillery will ultimately be limited by its capacity. Answer? A single brand: ‘Singleton,’ but from three distilleries, each focused on a different area of the world. Singleton of Dufftown is Europe’s expression, and this 15 year old combines cake mix, peanut butter, and fleshy fruits. There’s dried banana and vanilla on the palate, and a nutty sweet finish. £38 (Not available in the U.S.)"
576,"<price>69<rating>86<whiskey>The Dalmore Tweed Dram, 40%<review>Comprising 80 percent American white oak-matured whisky and 20 percent from ex-oloroso sherry casks, the Tweed Dram offers lots of citrus fruit on the nose, with an early dusting of icing sugar, then orange and lemon wine gums. Relatively light and fresh, with gentle fudge notes. Malt, toffee, cinnamon, and over-ripe oranges on the spicy palate. Quite long in the finish, with spicy oak, nutmeg, and lingering dark chocolate notes. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
577,"<price>85<rating>83<whiskey>Wild Scotsman, 15 year old, 46%<review>Pleasingly aromatic and floral, with lively fruit, fresh cereal grain, honey and vanilla cream. Subtle grassy, hay notes add complexity. A very friendly whisky, conjuring up images of a sunny afternoon in Spring. 
"
578,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates IPA Edition, 40%<review>Hoppy notes cloaking the crisp grains, green apple, and pomelo make for a happier marriage than its stout sibling. This is one of those whiskeys that continuously evolves in the mouth, progressing from a sweet, syrupy beginning of coconut macaroons, apple, and spices, to a creamier plateau of citrus, stewed fruits, and chocolate. It departs leaving the tongue weighted down with peppery spice and cooked apple. Unexpectedly delicious. Value pick"
579,"<price>4000<rating>95<whiskey>The Last Drop 50 year old, 50.9%<review>Would you have gambled The Last Drop 1960 liquid in new sherry wood for four more years? The indulgent nose proffers maple syrup, buckwheat honey, roasted spices, blue grapes, pomegranate, raspberry compote, cilantro, pandan leaf, and beefsteak juices soaking into mushroom gills. The complex, lustrous mouthfeel is replete with a sheen of rich maltiness, molasses lashed by sherry before a dry, resinous finish. Water brings an oily nuttiness, then further drops produce a silky, clingy texture. Glorious. Miraculous. Victorious. (388 bottles only)"
580,"<price>43<rating>81<whiskey>Great Lakes Distillery Kinnickinnic, 43%<review>A blend of aged (sourced) bourbon and Great Lakes’ own (young) malt whiskey. Quite sweet on the nose; a rich, herbal sweetness with a strong, youthful quality to it. Interestingly medicinal on the tongue as the herbal character swells. A full mouthfeel, with clear references to new make about it: a bit oily, grassy, and bright. The finish is the best part: minty and a bit drying, a pleasant farewell. Interesting concept. "
581,"<price>311<rating>91<whiskey>Celtic Cask Aon, 46%<review>It’s like Mom’s apple pie in a glass. This whiskey was distilled at Cooley and spent 14 years in bourbon, then 2 years extra maturation in an 80 year old Palo Contado sherry cask from Bodegas Emilio Hidalgo. Brown sugar, baked apples, warmed almonds, chocolate jimmies, nutmeg, vanilla, and cardamom. Sherry flavors caress, with apple, spun sugar, candied peel, sultanas, stone fruits, and the fruitiness of Scharffen Berger bars. Gracefully wanes, meditating on the red and black fruits. (711 bottles) €250"
582,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Fukano 2017 Edition, 42.8%<review>Supple nose of lychee, ripening peaches, candy hearts, watermelon, allspice, and white pepper. A light, slightly syrupy texture with an underbelly of watermelon and raspberry, this year’s release unwraps peach, nectarine, rhubarb, and custard candy, fruit Life Savers, stewed fruits, red berries, and light citrus. It’s surprising just how much flavor is packed into this rice whisky. Finish is dry—the watermelon is gone. (4,411 bottles)"
583,"<price>49<rating>85<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Pumpkin Spice, 40%<review>The aroma is rich with pumpkin pie notes and a strong citrus component. There’s eight tons of actual pumpkin in the year’s run of this seasonal; impressive, and you can smell the roasted gourd. The whiskey’s not sickly sweet as feared, but more like a homemade, sugarless pumpkin pie, almost savory. The flavor is solid, rich, and integrates well. For what it is, it’s done well, and it’s done boldly. I’d maybe back off the orange a bit."
584,"<price>25899<rating>94<whiskey>Cragganmore Prima & Ultima 48 year old 1971 (Cask No. 2301), 43.7%<review>Rich sherried fruit aromas, machine oil, camphor, coal dust, marzipan, and freshly
polished oak. Full and sweet on the early palate, then drying, with black coffee,
licorice, and the distinctive flavor of coal. A long finish, with dark chocolate and
cherry liqueur. No negative oakiness despite its age. Superb! Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (352 bottles) £20,000"
585,"<price>120<rating>86<whiskey>Balblair 1991 Duncan Taylor Rare Auld Range, 53.9%<review>This cask strength Northern Highlander offers a full and complex nose, comprising brandy notes, stewed apricots, spices, table salt, and white pepper. A hint of nougat turns to darker caramel. Rich on the palate, mouth-coating, sweet, with lively spices. The finish is buttery, with a pinch of ginger, and a final brandy-and-soda finish."
586,"<price>111<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfiddich Vintage Cask, 40%<review>One of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in Glenfiddich’s new solera vats, this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. Some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. The reverse happens on the palate, with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced), ripe fruits, and gentle creaminess. (Travel Retail; Asia only, currently.)£70"
587,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>FEW Delilah’s 23rd Anniversary, 50%<review>Lovely aromas of charred toast, nut bread, biscuits, fresh grain, rye spice, and some grassiness give way to a palate-coating sweetness, including malted milk balls, cocoa, and dark baking chocolate. The finish offers fine balance, with cherry fruit nicely matched with drying oak tannins and laced with sandalwood and spices. Vatted from 23 barrels, primarily bourbon and rye, though the malt component offers great backbone."
588,"<price>35<rating>81<whiskey>Whipnose, 47%<review>A Seven Stills and Pacific Brewing Laboratory collaboration: a distilled double IPA. Broiled grapefruit and caramel, with a razory lightness, but a bit muddled. Flavors of sweet malt and maple pierced in a needle-row with bitter hop resins, pine, pith; malt/hop/malt/hop comes in quick waves. Like some double IPAs, this is a blunt instrument that simply walks up and wallops you with hops and malt; neither subtle nor particularly complex. Hop fans may well love it; others will not. Price is per 375 ml."
589,"<price>500<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Twenty One, 46%<review>Distilled at a time when the future of the distillery looked bleak. It is non-chill filtered and mildly herbal on the nose, with soft peat, muted iodine, and a sprinkling of pepper, plus warm leather. The palate is initially peppery, then vanilla and green apples emerge, along with aniseed and rich peat. Peppery to the end, with a hint of iodine and coal smoke."
590,"<price>28<rating>80<whiskey>Glen Moray Peated Spirit Batch #1 Cask 141, 60.6%<review>Another Glen Moray, this time in a substantially different guise than normal. Yes, this is fresh, sweet, and malty — to be precise, draff-like — but there’s smoke as well, and a fairly decent belt of it. Young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate, especially with water, is cleansing and with vanilla, good phenols, and orris-like dryness. Very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)"
591,"<price>65<rating>81<whiskey>Wild Weasel Single Cask (cask #1), 46%<review>The broad grin on the face of Mike Janssen speaks volumes about his enthusiasm for the beers and spirits he produces at the Wilderen brewery-distillery. This first cask from 2011 has a young, grassy, and herbal nose, with orange peel, artichoke, and delicate black tea. Lithe yet warming flavors of citrus, pleasant barley notes, pepper, spice, and ginger, but with creeping vegetal notes. It still needs taming but it’s early days. Ginger, pepper, and celery on the finish. (300 bottles) €60"
592,"<price>43<rating>85<whiskey>Chambers Bay Straight Bourbon (Batch 6), 47.5%<review>Lots to unpack on the nose: dried orange peel, blueberry, maple syrup, herbs, and fragrant spices—cinnamon, allspice, clove, caraway; with water, green papaya and cedar. The palate is dry and chewy with oak, orange, cinnamon, clove, cedar oil, roasted nuts, chocolate, and crushed red pepper. It finishes simply, with dry oak, nutty chocolate, and cinnamon."
593,"<price>29<rating>86<whiskey>The Black Grouse, 40%<review>One might assume this to be just a smoky version of the standard Famous Grouse (with its honeyed malt, bright fruit, and floral demeanor). But, in addition to the enhanced smoke (which caringly adds a new dimension without smothering the other flavors), there also seems to be more malt body and oak spice in the mix, which I think takes Black Grouse to a higher level than Famous Grouse. The grain whisky contributes a “drinkability” component, making it a great introduction to smoky whiskies."
594,"<price>32<rating>85<whiskey>Gentleman Jack, 40%<review>A host of sweet confections—caramel corn, candied apples, toasted marshmallow, bubble gum, and gobs of banana taffy—are reminiscent of a warm summer night at the fair. The palate speaks of orchard fruits, sweet golden apples, and poached pear, as hints of peach and cocoa appear on the clean, enjoyable, and succinct finish."
595,"<price>59<rating>85<whiskey>Hatozaki Small Batch Blended Malt, 46%<review>This blended malt has stronger color and flavors than Hatozaki Finest, with scents of marzipan, orange sherbet, lime rind, apricot Danish pastry, and delicate wood spices. The palate keeps a focus on vanilla fudge and spice, but doesn’t really take you on a journey. There’s creamy vanilla, a slow burner of peppercorn, a little fudge, and honey for sure, but the anticipated fruitiness never really arrives."
596,"<price>718<rating>89<whiskey>Craigellachie 31 year old, 52.2%<review>The Craigellachies just keep on coming. This, the oldest of the new Original Bottling range, is the most fiercely priced. It shows balanced and slightly restrained mature notes—think of candle wax and waxed leather. Some fruit syrups, clementine, and honey then follow. The palate is thick—the distillery’s worm tubs having an effect—giving floral accents and a hint of barbecued pineapple. Not the heaviest of the range, but delicious. (Travel Retail exclusive) £500"
597,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Distillery 291 Single Barrel Colorado Rye Finished with Aspen Staves (Barrel #231), 50.8%<review>Heady tropical aromas swirl out of the glass: orange peel, guava, hibiscus, sandalwood, cedar, and cinnamon. Fruit—papaya, nectarine, blueberry, citrus, and grape—shows up in force on the palate as well, tempered by oak and milk chocolate, pistachios, and dried flowers. The finish is long and gently spiced, with soft oak, cedar, and cocoa flavors. Distillery 291 bottles all its rye as single-barrel batches of about 55-60 bottles each."
598,"<price>23<rating>80<whiskey>Slane Castle, 40%<review>Great malt flavor for a blend; creamy with honeyed vanilla, soothing caramel, lively summer fruits, golden raisin, subtle date, and butter cookie. Well-balanced, very clean with no harshness, and very drinkable!

It is a spicy mouthful at full strength, with clove and pepper dominating the citrus fruit, berries, and orchard fruit. Dilution is recommended, where flavors of baked apple, cinnamon, and raspberry emerge. NT$8,800"
600,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve (Lot 1867D), 40%<review>If you worried what would happen when Forty Creek ran out of Canadian oak barrels, you will be pleased to know John Hall found more local oak trees and had new barrels made; this time in Canada. This tightly integrated dram is rich in woody maple syrup, with raisins, almonds, and vanilla ice cream that softens a peppery glow. Silkier than the original, slightly restrained, and ever so quaffable. A longish, pithy finish begs another sip. Still a classic. Editor's Choice."
601,"<price>85<rating>84<whiskey>BenRiach Herodotus 12 year old, 46%<review>Finished in a pedro ximinez cask. This is the sweetest and most tactile of the three whiskies. Peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana, ripe peaches, pineapple, white chocolate, shortbread, and thick honey. Delicate floral notes (heather, lavender) add finesse. I expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. I was pleasantly surprised."
602,"<price>425<rating>86<whiskey>Charbay Whiskey Release III, 66.5%<review>After 6 years aging in charred new oak, and 8 years in “non-oak vessels” (stainless tanks), there’s a nose of oak, cedar, tart red plums, gooseberries, and fresh putty, but none of the heat you’d expect. Explosive in the mouth: sweet fruit and dry oak slam-dance and set off a surprising burst of hops (wash was craft-brewed pilsner). Exciting stuff, but a bit hot, even with water. (2,713 bottles released)"
603,"<price>176<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Foraged Fruit Fool (distilled at Blair Athol) 1991, 46%<review>The oldest bottling in Wemyss Malts’ March 2015 batch of six releases, Foraged Fruit Fool was aged in a bourbon barrel. Orchard fruits, double cream, vanilla, and ginger on the enticing nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, supple, becoming nuttier, with gentle spices. The finish is quite lengthy, with fruit bonbons, allspice, and prickly oak. (330 bottles) £120"
604,"<price>70<rating>83<whiskey>Tullibardine 228 Burgundy, 43%<review>Tullibardine 228 Burgundy is finished in red Burgundy casks from Chateau de Chassagne Montrachet, the home of Maison Michel Picard, which owns Tullibardine distillery. The nose features charred oak, vanilla, milk chocolate-covered Turkish Delight, and mild, sweet chili. Sweet and spicy on the nutty palate, with eating apples, cranberries, and a silky texture. Allspice and damsons in the lengthy finish. "
605,"<price>65<rating>80<whiskey>Singleton of Glen Ord Signature, 40%<review>Signature was new to the Singleton of Glen Ord range in 2013 as part of the Travel Retail exclusive Singleton Reserve Collection. Soft toffee, banana, and ginger on the nose accompanied by slightly herbal and pine notes. Sweet and easy-drinking, with a suggestion of sherry and drying oak. Licorice in the finish. RM263"
606,"<price>553<rating>88<whiskey>Tomatin, 1982 Vintage (Cask #92), 57%,<review>Aged in a refill sherry puncheon, and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. Soft and sweet, with caramel-coated mixed nuts, toffee apple, rhum agricole, currant (red and black), plum, cinnamon, and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). A pleasing, non-aggressive expression of a mature, sherried whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£340"
607,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>J. Henry Patton Road Reserve 5 year old Straight (Batch 149), 59.99%<review>A fruit-driven nose offers scents of apple, bananas, coconut, and poached pears, in addition to sweeter notes of red licorice, almond, sweet iced tea, and clove. The palate is quite different—hot and spicy—accompanied by notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and oak tannin. The finish turns rich and chocolaty, with honey, cherry, watermelon jelly fruit slices, cigar box, coconut, peach, cherry, and aromatic oak. Much on offer here, though it needs proofing down."
608,"<price>215<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut 6 year old Aatma Single Cask Single Malt (Cask No. 4675), 57.1%<review>Sweet saline peat on the nose, along with red berries, milk chocolate, hazelnuts, dates, and nougat. It’s lush and rich, qualities that extend to the palate’s oily, dense character, which is floral and soapy before shifting into plummy red berry fruit, dark chocolate, roasted hazelnuts, and a panoply of spices. The finish is ashy, peppery, sweet, and mouthwatering, with long, lingering smokiness. Water is a must to showcase the rounded, powerfully flavorful balance of this whisky. (360 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
609,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Speyburn 18 year old, 46%<review>Aged in American and Spanish oak. Figs, cinnamon, and pineapple up front on the nose; in time, smoky fudge. The palate is rich and creamy, with more fudge, honey, and tangerines. The orange note becomes more bitter, accompanied by lively spices and subtle woodsmoke. Long in the finish, with peppery oak."
610,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Nikka From the Barrel, 51.4%<review>Notably balanced and elegant, the colorful palette of whiskies combines for tremendous depth of flavor. Soft, sweet butterscotch and orange peel meet poached pears and stone fruits. Earthiness appears as dried autumn leaves, coffee, old oak, and tobacco. Among the tangle of spices, tasters identified chili pepper, allspice, cloves, and universally adored its ginger note. Finally, wisps of smoke and sea salt. Overall, it feels generously malty, with the grain whisky lending broad sweetness and supple mouthfeel across the long finish.

Beyond its delightful flavors, Nikka From the Barrel presents some paradoxes worthy of contemplation over a glass. It is a classic, yet new to the U.S. It is typically Japanese, yet singularly magnificent. It is delightful sipped neat and also blossoms with water. Even the simple, squat bottle is in contrast to the profound complexity within. (Fortunately, the 500 ml bottle offered in other markets received a supersizing for U.S. drinkers.)

The great majority of new Japanese whiskies now arriving to our shores are so rare and so expensive that they seem intended only for elite whisky lovers. Nikka From the Barrel is a consummate Japanese blend for anyone to enjoy. Number 1 in the 2018 Top 20

The palate has loads of spice, black tea, and a subtle earthiness. The finish brings on chile-pepper heat, bitter chocolate, burnt walnut, cooked cherries, and light herbaceousness. Very unusual, successfully venturing outside the box, with a deft mix of sweetness, chocolate, earthiness, and spice."
613,"<price>160<rating>96<whiskey>Chivas Regal Ultis, 40%<review>Captivating, enticing, and wonderfully charming, this first blended malt from Chivas Regal contains selections of five Speyside malts: Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval. Red apple, cherry, raspberry fudge, peach and mango fruit salad, dusting of cinnamon, and dry heather sprigs. In essence, it’s rich and satisfying, with dark vanilla, apricot, Bourneville-covered Brazil nuts, and tangerine, smoothed over by caramel and wood spices, maltiness, and gingersnap biscuits. Quite heavenly. Editor's Choice"
614,"<price>150<rating>93<whiskey>Wild Turkey Master's Keep Decades, 52%<review>When earth meets sweet in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Here, soil tilled deep, fresh-cut grass, and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate, followed by dill, oregano, and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. There’s more: apple fritters, spice, and saltwater taffy tingle the palate until the long finish introduces, for the first time, a hint of doughy pie crust. A must-have."
615,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Tom’s Foolery Ohio Straight Bourbon (barrel 19), 61.5%<review>With 4 years 3 months of age, this is a fine selection, with poached pear, stone fruit, brown sugar, and floral aromas nicely integrated. At cask strength, it serves up a bold and spicy punch to the palate, with peppery notes that quickly overpower the dried corn, treacle, and caramel sweetness. A little water allows that sweetness to shine through before the slightly tannic finish of drying oak and black walnut. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)"
616,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Benriach The Original Twelve, 46%<review>
This is a new recipe, replacing the old 12 year old. Rounded and warming on the nose, with stewed fruits, orange peel, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous in the mouth, with honey, milky coffee, figs, and dried fruit. Black currants, licorice, and lively spices in the finish. A really satisfying, well-structured dram."
617,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Peg Leg Porker 8 year old Tennessee Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Nashville barbecue icon Carey Bringle filters this whiskey through hickory charcoal, bottling it under the name of his restaurant. A candied nose of saltwater taffy and bubble gum, followed by peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla cake, banana, cracked pepper, and spicy oak. The palate offers almond, chocolate, coconut, tobacco, brown sugar, and blueberry pie. Water brings out rich milk chocolate, strawberry jam, and cherry cobbler. The finish is smooth and flavorful, with more chocolate, nuttiness, coconut, tobacco, and oak."
618,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>FEW American, 46.5%<review>Laden with herbs and spices—mint, caraway, earthy ginger—on the nose, along with furniture polish and lemon. The palate is oak-driven and rich, full of dark chocolate, zippy caraway, roasted lemon, and ginger. There’s a pleasant fruitiness as well, but the finish is dry, all gentle spice and chocolate. Takes water well—in fact, a few drops helps to tame some of the punchy heat. A blend of bourbon, rye, and malt whiskeys."
619,"<price>115<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Cadboll, 43%<review>Part of Glenmorangie’s Legends collection, this was finished in casks that previously held sweet French white wines. Sweet red berries on the somewhat shy nose, with developing low-key honey and vanilla. Nicely textured, with a palate of honey, caramel, milk chocolate, shortbread, and lots of lively spice. Lengthy in the finish, with more caramel and milk chocolate, plus strawberry and ginger. (Travel Retail exclusive) £85"
620,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Glenrothes, 1987 vintage, 43%<review>The most recent vintage from the 1980s. This whisky is very bright and lively.

It’s well-textured and drenched in flavor: blackberry jam, dark chocolate, mint oil, maple syrup, roasted nuts, root beer, clove, white pepper, toasted coconut, and cherry cough drops. Wet walnuts, oak, and lingering intensity on the finish. Add water to unlock more spice and fruit, and give it plenty of time to develop."
622,"<price>206<rating>82<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 25 year old, 50.4%<review>Gold. Quite sweet and spicy nose. Light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. There remains a light cereal aspect to the background, but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. The palate is equally sweet and direct, with excellent spicy concentration. Water shows that there is some weight here, reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). The nose now hints at some oxidation, the palate retains peppery freshness. It’s another I’d have kept in cask. £135"
623,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Rock Town Single Barrel Reserve Rye (Barrel 22), 57.9%<review>Cask-strength rye made from Arkansas-grown grain, aged 26 months. Must be a small barrel; it’s quite dark. Nose of crushed rye grain, well-polished oak furniture, and moist rye bread. Swift and certain in the mouth: dense, chewy flavors of rye bread, sweet and full and bitter, crackling with oak spice, and drawing to a sizzling finish. I do like a small distiller whiskey that knows where it’s going. Very impressive."
624,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s Rye, 68.1%<review>Is this perfect? From the look and nose, yes. Rich caramel and campfire smoke early on; it’s robust, but balanced. Crème brûlée with a sultry smokiness, raw honey with a dusting of nutmeg and a Scotch ale malt profile that’s creamy and mouth-coating. Alas, a heavy bite hides much, needing water to open up. A drop adds complexity, spice, vanilla, chocolate, and licorice."
625,"<price>20<rating>85<whiskey>Trader Joe’s Bourbon Cask Finish Highland, 40%<review>On the nose, spiced plums, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and cooked fruit mingle with seawater and a waft of guava. A tug of war between sweet—orange oil, cookies with lemon icing—and spice—cloves, dried ginger—resolves into a finish of milk chocolate with a hint of hookah tobacco. This is light and a bit hot, but its perfumy character shows well. Finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. (Trader Joe’s)"
626,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 58.95%<review>There’s no age statement, but this wheated bourbon is about 10 years old. This is the softest and gentlest of the Antique Collection. Notes of molasses, black raspberry jam, ripe blueberry, teaberry, soft fig, and cinnamon. Gently spicy, clean finish. Could this whiskey be too easy to drink?

627,"<price>25<rating>77<whiskey>Amherst Gate, 40%<review>Rum—“screech,” as it is called where it is made—is Newfoundland’s spirit of choice. With three shots of screech and a ceremony involving fish, visitors are transformed into honorary Newfies. This 3 year old Amherst whisky, custom blended for the Newfoundland Liquor Commission, is ancient by comparison. It’s a basic mixer that arrives peppery hot with strong overtones of half-tamed spirit. Dusty wood, lime peels, and burnt toffee foretell a leisurely slide into refreshing bitterness. Definitely not screech. (Newfoundland only)  C$25"
628,"<price>15<rating>82<whiskey>Monarch of The Glen 8 year old, 40%<review>Standard blends fall into two categories: those that will behave nicely when mixed to offer almost non-whisky experience, and those that are feistier and want to make sure you know they’re there. This is the former, and with whiskies like this one, it’s possible to blink and miss it. That doesn’t make it bad; just indistinctive and unexceptional. There is little sign of the wood here, but the delicate, sweet apricot notes just do enough."
629,"<price>320<rating>91<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 3), 56.5%<review>A nose of oak, lemon meringue pie, lashings of vanilla, pink peppercorns, and paprika. It’s particularly mouth-drawing at cask strength, offering vanilla, toffee, a slight nuttiness, and banana, with a clove spiciness that really takes hold. It keeps surging forward, finding different ways for the spices to peak before settling on a vanilla finish."
630,"<price>42<rating>84<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 12 year old, 40%<review>Past bottlings were distilled at the Bushmills or Cooley distilleries (excepting the rare, original 1951 Vintage, which was from the old B. Daly distillery). This one is triple distilled, so think Bushmills. (Cooley distills their whisky twice.) In the past, I’ve noticed a lot of flavor development in Bushmills from 10 to 12 years old. This Knappogue 12 year old is a fresh, clean, smooth Irish whisky, displaying a nice creamy texture. I’m finding honeyed vanilla, toasted marshmallow, and lots of fruit (citrus, pineapple, coconut, and peach). A soft, dry oak finish shores up the sweetness and adds a smattering of spice. A pleasant, entry-level Irish single malt. (Additional note: Knappogue Castle has historically been a whisky with a vintage, not an age statement. While it will be nice to have some consistency here, I will miss the subtle differences that each of the previous vintage offerings provided.)"
631,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) Rare Auld Range 1987 vintage 24 year old, 55.7%<review>Full gold in color, this Bunna initially has the lifted Moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine Darjeeling leaf tea, then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. The palate continues in this sweet vein, but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate, as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. With water, there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. Altogether delicious and subtly complex."
632,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>anCnoc Vintage 2001, 46%<review>Matured in a mix of sherry casks and bourbon barrels for over 15 years, the nose is floral and fruity, with honeysuckle, nectarines, malt, and soft spices. Very smooth and creamy on the palate, with apple pie, butterscotch, honey, and tangerines, combining with dried fruits. Citrus fruit and spicy milk chocolate in the medium-length finish."
633,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Old Pulteney 21 year old, 46%<review>This 21 year old expression is lighter in color and not as sweet or fruity as the younger 17 year old also reviewed here. Very mouthcoating in texture, with notes of dry vanilla, fat barley, coconut, citrus fruit, and pineapple. Long, intensely appetizing, dry salty finish. As an aperitif, or perhaps with seafood."
634,"<price>125<rating>89<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. Journey Cask Collection Hibernia 11 year old, 57%<review>It’s all about the candied fruit in this single malt sourced from an undisclosed Irish distillery: Skittles, grapefruit peel, gummy orange wedges, green apple candy, and Trix cereal on the nose, along with white pepper and ginger. A very sweet palate is well-served by its cask strength, showing clementine, grapefruit, guava, white pepper, and toasted grain. The finish holds nothing back, mixing salted pecans, leathery oak, and white pepper with citrus and grain. 216 bottles"
635,"<price>67<rating>81<whiskey>Port Askaig 12 year old, 45.8%<review>A trio of new expressions of what has become an established Islay brand. This one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. A little hard, but pleasantly bracing.£44 "
636,"<price>84<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glentauchers) 8 year old, 54.8%<review>Lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54"
637,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Black Bottle, 40%<review>In terms of bang for your buck this has always been one of the very best blends, punching well above its weight. Whether you feel the same about this revamped version depends on how much you want a peat punch. Previously rough and gutsy, this is softer, with more licorice and treacle but also more younger sappiness. Smoke has the last say but it's like an aging sportsman, replacing energy and attitude with guile and subtlety."
638,"<price>15<rating>79<whiskey>Meaghers 1878, 40%<review>A robust, pleasing, yet simple session whisky, 1878 is made for mixing and shooting but not for contemplation. Wet stones with some sweetness on the nose predict the almost liqueur-like sweetness of the palate. It quickly becomes hot and zippy with a white pepper payload. Before long some slight bitter pithiness creeps in, then subsides leaving crème brulée and Caramac candy bar, with a rich, almost eggy mouthfeel. The finish is short with cleansing grapefruit pith. (Canada only) C$19"
639,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>New Holland Beer Barrel Bourbon, 40%<review>Another MGP/LDI-sourced whiskey: but New Holland finishes it in oak barrels that they’ve used to age their Dragon’s Milk imperial stout, an interesting reversal of the bourbon barrel-aged beers brewers are making. It gives a dark wood nose with cinnamon and hot fruit. The whiskey’s a bit light in the mouth but enticingly smooth, a flow of corn, wood, and anise that flares up at the finish in a nice rush of heat. Quite good…but not great. "
640,"<price>34<rating>86<whiskey>Breaking & Entering, 43%<review>Sourced from several undisclosed Kentucky bourbon distillers. Well-rounded and nicely balanced, with prominent spice (cinnamon, clove, evergreen, powdered vanilla), soft fruit (mandarin, coconut, apricot, hint of pineapple), and toasted nuts, all on a bed of caramel. Very versatile: mature enough for pleasurable sipping (but just), and youthful enough to add zing to a cocktail. "
641,"<price>2750<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan Masters of Photography 1995 (Release 3, Cask #14007), 59.6%<review>With the hue of pigeon blood (a ruby, not a dead bird), initially this seems closed, but richness develops, mixing stewed Assam tea, chocolate biscuit, raisin, damson jam, and a whiff of tomato puree. The oak gives it the character of a Barolo Chinato. A knife and fork are needed to consume it, but for all the big tannins, there’s dark rose petal and the bittersweet edge of licorice. Dry, rich, and hermetic. For the hardcore sherry lover. 145 bottles."
642,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Rogue Spirits Dead Guy American Single Malt, 40%<review>Tropical fruit on the verge of overripeness: pineapple, papaya, kiwi, plus jasmine flowers, almond halva, and the piney-lemon aroma of hops. The hoppiness is evident on the palate, which is light in body and consequently less expressive in flavor, though there’s dry nuttiness and grain, overlaid with sweeping tropical fruit. More of the same hoppy, juicy fruit flavors juxtaposed with oak on the finish. If you like beery whiskey, this is one to try. (10,000 bottles)"
643,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Clonakilty, 43.6%<review>Ahead of the distillery opening, Michael Scully is working on a series of Clonakilty releases in the warehouse. His promising first release is bourbon cask matured, with a nose of raspberry, strawberry taffy, roasted coriander seed, star anise, apple, green fruits, and smoldering cooperage oak. The palate brings mandarin, light honey, sweet oak, creamy vanilla, fresh banana, peppercorns, and custard. Vanilla sweetness and a welcome spicy buzz to finish. (3,000 bottles)"
644,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon, 44%<review>Initially restrained; as the nose opens up it reveals plum, red berry fruit, pine resin, and root-beer spices. The palate picks up a bit, slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive, herbal-cherry cough drop, and sweet vanilla, leading to a modest finish laced with licorice, cinnamon, and pine forest."
645,"<price>539<rating>92<whiskey>Limeburners Barrel Strength Heavy Peat, 61%<review>Burning driftwood, crisp bacon fat, and melting asphalt in a heat wave cut through with vanilla cream, butterscotch, and chocolate ganache. Great Southern distillery has unleashed a multidimensional beast that opens innocently with vanilla and honey, quickly blown away by a blast of salt and pepper before a deep, primeval base of peat and spice well up from the depths of your soul. Amazingly, great tenderness even at this strength, with a long, complex finish of smoke, sweetness, and spice. A$700"
646,"<price>103<rating>86<whiskey>Caol Ila 14 year old Special Release 2012, 59.3%<review>This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and Mars bar. With water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue.  "
647,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>The Balvenie 17 year old, 43%<review>The Balvenie continues its limited edition releases of 17 year old whiskies. Previous editions included an Islay Cask finish and a New Oak finish. This is the newest one, aged in sherry oak casks. It’s a delicious whisky, with clean, ripe, sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. Notes of apple pie, honeyed summer fruit, caramel toasted almonds, and toffee, with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. A big, full-bodied Balvenie that satisfies."
648,"<price>49<rating>81<whiskey>Two James Rye Dog, 50.5%<review>A 100% rye unaged “white whiskey.” Nose is fruity—pear, apple, black raspberry—and peppery, with a mineral edge to it, like fresh-cracked stone. Creamy sweet mouth, repeating the fruits in half-voice, with a sharp alcoholic heat. Sweetness makes me curious about the fermentation attenuation…but this would be good with seltzer."
649,"<price>45<rating>91<whiskey> Chivas Extra 13 year old Tequila Cask, 40%<review>The nose is strikingly different than what is typical of Chivas Regal; aside from tequila, there are a lot of floral notes, perfumed soaps, Jaffa orange, and a little pepper. Pear and tequila notes on the palate reverberate around a central hub of spice before sweetness breaks through, surfing a wave of orange, grapefruit juice, and fresh green apple. A very smooth drink; this is sweet, spicy, and invigorating."
650,"<price>199<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box Last Vatted Grain, 46%<review>Bottled as London's Big Ben began to strike midnight on the day that the word 'vatted' was outlawed in Scotch whisky terminology, this is a mix of grains from different distilleries and does the campaign for more Scotch grain whisky no harm at all. Gossamer soft and smooth with a honeycomb heart and milk chocolate, vanilla, and the odd prod of spice, it's a cushion of a whisky. Luxurious, indulgent, and well made. £125"
651,"<price>54<rating>84<whiskey>Tomintoul 14 year old, 46%<review>One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries, Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. Pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)"
652,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Redwood Empire American Whiskey, 45%<review>A blend of 11, 5, and 4 year old bourbons blended with 2 and 3 year old ryes. Pine, cedar, and cigar box offer a pleasant botanical and masculine nose that has slight hints of dill and roasted corn. It’s bright and extremely interesting, with notes of Mexican chocolate, strawberry and orange Marmajam, rye toast, and peanut butter. The medium finish offers a hint of wintergreen"
653,"<price>108<rating>79<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 1992 21 year old HH9451, 59.6%<review>A sweet, aromatic nose, with fresh cream, flaked almonds, macaroons, pomegranate juice, and a veneer of vanilla from this refill barrel. The palate starts warm and sweet, then revs up to full power; light butterscotch, cotton candy, clementine, Toledo marzipan, and corn kernels, with a hint of fresh green salad leaves. The short finish picks over corn, cake mix, and cream soda. Power, but not enough finesse from the wood here. £64"
654,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>The Tyrconnell, 10 year old, Port Cask Finish, 46%<review>Deeper, thicker, and more lush than the Madeira Cask Finish reviewed above. Notes of strawberry preserve, caramel apple, nougat, sponge cake, and a hint of chocolate cream pie. All these sweet, richly textured flavors without being cloying. Nicely done."
655,"<price>62<rating>85<whiskey>Wigle Straight Rye, 50.5%<review>Organic Pennsylvania-grown rye, 3 years old, pot-distilled a 20-minute walk from the Monongahela River. Nose: sharp rye and hard oak, floral wreathing, but not hair-crispingly hot. Oh, nice rye mouth, flavorful, not overly bitter, the oak’s held in check, and there’s a minty sweetness to it. Finish is well-tempered, until a note of perfume sneaks in at the end."
656,"<price>180<rating>93<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof Rye 10 year old, 55.1%<review>Redemption delivers a 10 year old, barrel proof rye (sourced from MGP); the bottled whiskey is mingled from only six barrels. Nose of hot, bitter rye spice and caramel with oak. Great whambam! feel of sweet whiskey followed immediately by oily, spicy rye, which then controls the flavor and finish without dominating. Not over-oaked, and these older MGP barrels are finally showing what 95% rye can do. At 6 years, it could be a high-rye bourbon; this simply shouts rye. Fascination."
657,"<price>275<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism The Muse, 53.3%<review>Buttery vanilla, marzipan, honey, ripening melon, orange water, lavender, and muted spices lead to a gorgeous, rounded, sugar-sweet palate of vanilla, beeswax, citrus, ground almond, and shortbread. Precision-engineered to ensure the exquisite flavor never stops. (3,060 bottles)"
658,"<price>31<rating>85<whiskey>Shieldaig 12 year old, 40%<review>This is a sharp dresser, with a firm, solid mouthfeel and an altogether finer and more focused taste than Shieldaig Classic (see
below). It’s not coastal or earthy particularly, either. Instead the flavors are softer and built around mocha, smooth creamy toffee, and some soft fruit, including a touch of overripe banana and melon notes. The savoriness this time comes from a touch of pepper rather than salt."
659,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Old Dominick Huling Station Very Small Batch Bourbon, 50%<review>Swirling aromas in the glass make it hard to pick out distinct notes, but a few emerge: mint leaves, leather bookbinding, raisins, grape jelly, and—after some time and water—caramel and candied peanuts. Light and silky in the mouth, a few drops of water make the flavors pop: cherry pie filling, berry and grape jams, chocolate, polished oak, and maple syrup. The finish has dark fruit, dark chocolate, and lengthy mint and tea leaf. (18,000 bottles)"
660,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach 25 year old, 46.8%<review>Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. Honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish, complex dram."
661,"<price>195<rating>89<whiskey>Provenance (distilled at Port Ellen), 21 year old, 1982 vintage, 46%<review>One of the last remaining vintages from an Islay distillery which will be missed dearly. This is obviously from a sherry cask, and the peat smoke, sherry, and oak-aging is married nicely here. It a brooding Port Ellen. Notes of peat fires, fig, kippers, toffee, vanilla, and dry oak take turns entertaining the palate. Considering its age, it isn’t excessively oaked, and the Port Ellen character still shines through. If you’re going to track down a bottle of Port Ellen before they get really difficult to find, this one is worth serious consideration.

662,"<price>119<rating>95<whiskey>Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-1), 57.55%<review>A glass of this whiskey starts with a fragrant nose of honey blossom, wild strawberries, vanilla custard, and a dusting of cocoa powder. The palate is a complex mélange of cherries, blueberries, blackberries, mango, and orange marrying with dark chocolate, baking spice, lush oak, aged tobacco leaf, and a light espresso note. More richness and complexity on a delicious finish of chocolate, blackberry jam, walnuts, and coconut shavings."
663,"<price>85<rating>89<whiskey>Whiskey Del Bac Distiller’s Cut Cask-Strength American Single Malt, 58.15%<review>Dark tobacco, horehound, saddle leather, mesquite smoke, and dried fruits rightly suggest the intensity to come from this Arizona malt. The robust palate features grilled corn, heaps of char, and savory smoked meats, with a burnt-sugar note that is both bitter and sweet. This is bold and flavor-packed, like drinking a glass of brisket. The no-holds-barred finish displays campfire smoke, milk chocolate, and burning citrus oil. (1,650 bottles)"
664,"<price>22<rating>73<whiskey>Canadian Five Star, 40%<review>A tad thin for sipping, Five Star is a quintessential mixing whisky, laden with dusty rye and citrus pith; it begs for ginger ale. First, though, sip it neat, and feel it blossom in your mouth; it brims with spirit, caramel, and blistering pepper. Behind these linger orange zest, herbaceous tones, creamy corn, and refreshing bitterness. Tingling rye spices that play off the pepper perk up its sweet fruitiness. Now mix it, and delight in its straightforward simplicity. (Canada only) C$22"
665,"<price>85<rating>93<whiskey>Yamazaki 12 year old, 43%<review>The first thing you notice is the elegant fragrance of lychee, spring blossoms, lily, rosewater, and raspberry meringue. Deeper in, grassy notes with star fruit, kumquat, and kaffir lime leaves. The flavors offer perfection in their simplicity: silky honey, soft spices, crystalized pineapple, barley sugar, lemon, and orange. On the finish, the spices chatter on and on as the sweet citrus and honey fade in and out. One to cherish."
666,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Hirsch Small Batch, 46%<review>This is unique in that it seems to be malt-forward, specifically floor malt, with oak and cinnamon following. But caramel enters the dance and does so in a big way. Nuances of crème brûlée, caramel popcorn, maple syrup, and caramelized corn with hints of cola, raspberry, and apple tart. While the flavor is here, the finish is just a touch short to put this in elite company. Nonetheless, it’s a decent sipper."
667,"<price>85<rating>87<whiskey>Barrell 5 year old Cask-Strength Bourbon (Batch 007), 61.2%<review>5 years is when bourbon really starts developing complexity, and you find the beginnings of greatness here, with saltwater taffy, vanilla custard, citrus, corn pudding, and a healthy dose of cinnamon. Its proof offers satisfying warmth that quickly turns to spice. Medium finish gracefully gives a hint of warm vanilla icing. In an age of barrel strength bourbons, this is a good one, but lacks complexity for higher praise. Sourced whiskey."
668,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Connemara Original, 40%<review>Exudes beautiful soft peat notes, barley sugar, and apple-cinnamon granola. Light lemon and honey, with a delightful growth in apple crumble flavors, golden syrup, and more peat smoke and orchard fruits on the finish. Drink this neat."
669,"<price>407<rating>91<whiskey>Glen Grant 25 year old, 43%<review>Glen Grant’s new(ish) owner Campari is putting its money where its mouth is. Investment in plant, wood, and an impressive visitor center is slowly being backed up with a series of new releases. This venerable example comes from Gordon & MacPhail’s stocks, but is an official bottling due out in time for Christmas. This is GG in relaxed, avuncular mode: subtle woods, amber, Oolong tea, anise. The palate is old apple, fresh plum, cream, and ginger spiciness. £255(Available at the distillery, in France, and Travel Retail in Asia only.)"
670,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>I.W. Harper 15 year old, 43%<review>Diageo has “brought I.W. Harper home” after years of absence from the U.S. market with this bottling and a base bottling (see below). The source is “new” Bernheim, but with a different mashbill from the base; this is 86% corn. Nose is warm corn and oak, with some spicy clove and cinnamon notes. Great medium-weight body and balance, palate repeats the nose, oaky-sweet finish; well-integrated whiskey. But my eyes pop at the price."
671,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Bulleit 95 Straight Rye, 45%<review>The floral and violet candy notes on the nose suggest a younger rye, followed by fresh citrus, and a pronounced herbal quality that borders on vinyl, with primary grain aromas peering through like warm porridge. On the palate, it emerges a bit hot up front, on the thin side, as sweet vanilla, honey, and tropical fruit meet peppery spices, tinged with caraway and licorice. A solid, if somewhat simple sipper."
672,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Sierra Norte Single Barrel Yellow, 45%<review>Master mezcalero Douglas French captures the flavor of native Oaxacan heirloom corn in this unique and singular spirit—the first single-barrel Mexican whisky available in the U.S. Distilled in San Agustín de las Juntas, each of French’s trio of whiskies uses a single variety of ancestral corn that requires hand-harvesting, promoting jobs in traditional farming. Aged for a mere 10 months in French oak, Yellow has swirling notes of blue iris, dried chilies, and fresh linen around a core of plump corn, with tangy marmalade, maple syrup, pepper, and a spiced-honey finish. Number 20 in the 2018 Top 20 "
673,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Egan’s Fortitude, 46%<review>Prune, fig, dried cranberry, malt loaf, flame-grilled peach, a squirt of barbecued meat juices, and dry spices including coriander seed and red chili flakes highlight the PX cask aging of this triple-distilled malt. Big flavors in a good, full bodied dram with juicy red fruits, ruby grapefruit, caramelized orange, milk chocolate, with a thin line of spices and a short chocolate brownie finish."
674,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Glencadam 15 year old, 46%<review>After an absence of a couple of years, the 15 year old is back. Its temporary withdrawal was due to a shortage of appropriately aged stocks, now in supply. The nose is delicate, with floral notes, plus cereal, cooking apples, and a hint of white pepper. Honey figures on the early palate, with vanilla, more cereal, roasted chestnuts, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length, with oak and ginger."
675,"<price>38<rating>92<whiskey>Forty Creek Three Grain Twentieth Anniversary, 40%<review>This final reprise of one of Forty Creek’s original whiskies is one juicy, succulent
dram. Fruity hints of red grapes on the nose mingle with sherry-sweetened pipe
tobacco and herbal earthiness. Sizzling peppers bolster a palate rich in nutty waxy
barley, soft oily corn, and dry dusty rye. Suggestions of halva and citrus zest lead into
a long, briskly spicy herbal finish.

676,"<price>1200<rating>90<whiskey>Caledonian ‘The Cally’ 1974 40 year old, 53.3%<review>If your glass is half empty, you might overlook this because it is the most expensive single grain Scotch whisky released to date. If your glass is half full, you will relish sweet toffee popcorn, coconut, fresh fruits, linseed oil, and some spicy and nutty notes. Makes sense, as South African white maize was heavily used in the production in the early 1970s. It’s mouth filling, dark and brooding, with plenty of chocolate, oak tannins, char, and layered spice. Sumptuous. (5,060 bottles)"
677,"<price>262<rating>89<whiskey>Tomatin Cù Bòcan 1988 Limited Edition, 51.5%<review>Tomatin released this 28 year old expression under its Cù Bòcan label. This cask strength variant was matured in refill hogsheads and refill sherry butts that previously contained heavily-peated Islay single malt. The nose is sweet and fruity, with apples and pears, background vanilla, and sweet, light smoke. The palate is voluptuous and sherry-sweet, with chili peppers and subtle, earthy peat smoke. The finish is slowly drying, with persistent spice, nuts, and smoke. (2,200 bottles) £200"

The nose opens with beef gravy, soon followed by prunes, cherries, dark chocolate, and PX sherry. Full-bodied, rich and sweet on the palate, with lively spices, and more cherries, and chocolate. Long and fruity in the finish, with spicy sherry and licorice. £750"
679,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla) 40 year old, 40%<review>Deep amber color. Mature aroma-this is definitely an old whisky -with complex wood spices (cedar, vanilla, mint, caramel) and soft ripe fruit. Medium bodied and soft. Surprisingly balanced on the palate with an incredible depth and maturity. Its flavors are similar to its aroma, but a soft sweetness compliments the flavors and provides balance. Soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth. 
"
680,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes 18 year old, 43%<review>Spicy on the nose, with deep, full tropical fruit notes, praline, and marzipan. The palate is silky, with fudge and raisins, then cherry liqueur. The finish yields dark chocolate and citrus fruit, plus peppery oak."
681,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Knob Creek Quarter Oak Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>A portion of this limited-release straight bourbon is aged in new charred oak quarter casks, which enable more contact with the wood. The nose offers vanilla, licorice, dried herbs, red fruit, confectionary sugar, iced tea, and orange peel. A chewy palate shows off the oak influence, and has notes of spice, chocolate-covered candied oranges, blackberry compote, cinnamon, and peppercorns. Drying oak on a finish of dark cherry, chocolate, orange, and cola."
682,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 16 year old “NC2” (distilled at Aberlour), 46%<review>This whisky packs a lot of clean, complex, and well-balanced flavors. It features a creamy, layered, malty-sweet foundation (vanilla, caramel, toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin, honeyed orchard fruit, currant), rounded out by firm, dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint) that dances on the palate. Long, warming, spicy finish. Nicely done!"
683,"<price>29<rating>84<whiskey>Grant’s Signature, 40%<review>Brian Kinsman’s new creation was inspired by their founder William Grant, with a remit to create a malty blend of character. Digestive biscuits, malt, honeycomb, and confectioner’s chocolate melted over a bain-marie. It’s a satisfyingly rich dram, well-structured with a great mouthfeel that wanes with natural dilution. Banoffee pie, caramel biscuits, and maltiness deepen to flavors of coffee bean and molasses, leaving a teeth-coating finish of black coffee. (UK and France only) £18"
684,"<price>144<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular 1988 (distilled at Glenturret), 45.4%<review>A 27 year old offering from Glenturret, in Perthshire, this bottling is from a refill hogshead that was filled in December 1988. Fresh mango and ripe peaches on the early nose, followed by a slightly smoky, earthy note. Viscous on the palate, with orchard fruit notes, coconut, caramel, and nutmeg. Drying in the finish, with mildly tannic oak, black pepper, and a final flourish of citrus. (264 bottles) £110"
685,"<price>164<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1991 Thread of Smoke, 46%<review>Yes, it’s another 1991 Bunna from Wemyss, so check the name when purchasing. This one has a distinctly smoky element alongside the marine note which they both share. Very light lemon, with water, then a hit that’s like walking into a high-class sushi joint. A zesty start with lots of angelica, and then sweetness with, when diluted, soft malt and light ginger on the palate. Rock solid. £103"
686,"<price>35<rating>92<whiskey>Kentucky Peerless Double Oak II Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (No. 150718105), 53.95%<review>A nose of confectioners’ sugar and peach tart, as well as Toblerone, cherry cola, roasted almonds, barrel char, leather, and drying oak. More baking spice on the palate, melding with chocolate syrup, savory notes of roasted nuts and charred corn, pepper, and perfumed oak. Earthy notes emerge with water, along with spice and chocolate. An herbal finish offers flavors of cherry tart, light chocolate, and spice. Very tasty, and with plenty of panache."
687,"<price>80<rating>82<whiskey>Vintage Bourbon, 21 year old, 47%<review>Interestingly crisper than and not as rich as the 17 year old, with warming oak spice to accompany the light toffee, cocoa powder, “corn in a burlap sack,” sultana, and dusty mint. Peppery, spicy oak finish that lingers. The fieriest of the three. 
"
688,"<price>220<rating>92<whiskey>Longrow 18 year old, 46%<review>This limited release was matured in 60% refill sherry butts and 40% fresh bourbon barrels. Initially sweet vanilla and ripe apple notes on the nose, giving way to chimney soot and dry peat. The palate is very full and oily, with honey and vanilla merging with smoked haddock, charcuterie, and more overt peat. Licorice, coffee beans, brine, chili, and peppery peat in the lengthy finish. (4,500 bottles)"
689,"<price>93<rating>87<whiskey>Carn Mor (distilled at Ben Nevis) 1997, 46%<review>This single cask 17 year old expression of Ben Nevis was matured in a sherry butt which yielded 747 bottles. It appears in Carn Mor’s “Strictly Limited” series of releases and has not been chill filtered. The bold nose opens with slightly savory notes and hard-boiled eggs. Sherry, malt, and figs subsequently develop. Quite full-bodied, with rich Jaffa orange and developing plain chocolate on the palate. More dark chocolate and a suggestion of fennel in the medium-length finish. £55"
690,"<price>95<rating>92<whiskey>BenRiach Pedro Ximinez Finish 1995 Vintage (Cask 7165), 52.3%<review>This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as Springbank does with Longrow, or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark, lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)"
691,"<price>67<rating>85<whiskey>Noss Head, 46%<review>This expression has been matured entirely in bourbon casks and offers a fresh nose of ozone and lemon, becoming quite fragrant in time. More mouth-coating than might be expected, yet easy drinking, with milk chocolate, malt, tropical fruits, and an edge of sea salt. The finish is medium in length, with wood spices. £40/liter"
692,"<price>166<rating>90<whiskey>Jura One For You 18 year old, 52.5%<review>This is the final release in a three-part series that began in 2016 with One For The Road, followed by One For All. Initially aged for 18 years in bourbon barrels, then finished in virgin American oak quarter casks. The nose features tinned peach segments, coconut, and white pepper. The palate offers caramel, marzipan, almonds, and sultanas. Dark chocolate, raisins, and black pepper in the finish. £130"
693,"<price>27<rating>84<whiskey>Mulligan’s Bourbon, 40%<review>Caramel corn, vanilla cream, citrus, evergreen, and a peppering of cinnamon. Soft oak finish. Pleasant, straightforward, youthful, and uncomplicated. Would prefer to see it bottled at a higher strength."
694,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 70.1%<review>Distilled in 2002. For many years now, this wheated whiskey has maintained just the right amount of oak influence for balance and added complexity. This year’s release is sporting some extra dried oak spice (especially on the finish), but it’s still a delicious whiskey. Notes of toffee, maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon, and vanilla, with a dry, allspice and polished leather finish."
695,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Port Dundas 12 year old, 40%<review>It’s been four years since Diageo last released an official single grain whisky from this Glasgow distillery. This will kick off your evening with its aromas of golden syrup flapjacks, light vanilla sponge fingers, and waxy linseeds. The American oak notes are all over this: vanilla, sweet granola, and pecan, yet there is a squeeze of lemon and a square of milk chocolate too. The creamy finish has real length and makes this a most accessible grain whisky."
696,"<price>64<rating>87<whiskey>Grand Traverse Ole George Double Barrel 100% Straight Rye, 46.5%<review>The quality is instantly discernable, even as the rye grain takes a back seat to layered aromas of cherry and dark currant, coupled with sweet notes of brown sugar and treacle underscored by fresh oak, toasted spices, and dark chocolate. Beyond its richness and depth, this beams bright and lively on the palate as grapefruit zest meets rye bread, followed by a finish of harmonized sweetness and spice. Aged 3 years in American oak; finished in French oak. (Distillery only)"
697,"<price>95<rating>89<whiskey>Hillrock Estate Double Cask Rye (Barrel No. 117), 45%<review>Aged first in #3 char new American oak and then in #4 char new American oak. The result is depth and complexity, starting with a nose that’s pretty and aromatic. There’s an appealing hint of mustiness and scents of bitter chocolate, cherry, dried herbs, licorice, and figs. A spiced palate delivers dark fruits, burnt marshmallow, espresso, and oak char. It also finishes with a char note, along with bitter chocolate, raisins, and prunes. (60,000 bottles)"
698,"<price>70<rating>80<whiskey>The Arran Malt Limited Edition, 58.4%<review>Reddish amber color. Aromas of honey drenched fruit, toffee, and fudge. Medium to heavy in body. Rich and sweet in flavor (toffee, fudge, caramel), with interwoven notes of rich, ripe fruit. Lingering toffee sweetness on the finish. 
"
699,"<price>125<rating>82<whiskey>Greenore 18 year old, 46%<review>Greenore is the grain whisky produced by Cooley, and as an 8 year old and a 15 year old it has proved to be a world beater.  Now it’s being marketed as the oldest Irish single grain whiskey in the world, and while there’s lots to recommend, this age might be a step too far. Lashings of banana and vanilla ice cream are up front, but then sharp salt and pepper slash across it and leave an astringent, puckerish mixed finish. "
700,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Auchentoshan 18 year old, 55.8%<review>Aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. The sherry is kept in balance and does not mask Auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. The classic Auchentoshan creamy, grassy, freshness abounds, complemented by honey-soaked almonds, cereal grain, and an array of bright fruit (citrus, sultana, mandarin). Not as polished as the Auchentoshan 21 year old, but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the U.S.)"
701,"<price>159<rating>85<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Explorers' Club Royal Route, 40%<review>I had to double check that price. My feelings are well recorded on premium whiskies bottled at 40% and if you were to ask me whether the whisky's worth the price tag, the answer's no. That doesn't make it a bad whisky, though; far from it. It has a light, dusty, and fruity nose reminiscent of raspberry sherbet, and on the palate there is trademark smoke, and pleasant toffee and treacle. Good, but in stellar company here. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
702,"<price>695<rating>91<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt, Hanyu 23 year old “sherry casks,” 58%<review>This oldie (from a distillery which closed in 2000) seems pretty straightforward compared to the Mizunara [see following review], but has less dried fruit than the sherry note on the label might suggest. Think dried peels rather than raisin, then stir in some freshly-polished floor. The aromas are saturated and heavy — almost as if they are drifting towards you on humid air.
The palate shows light smoke and then a pleasant quinine bitterness mid-palate. This has the Japanese quality of laying flavors out very precisely on the tongue while also heightening their intensity. Water reduces the quinine effect, allowing the richness of the spirit to come through. Hanyu was a pretty big and firm (even rigid) whisky. Here that shell has cracked, allowing anise and blueberry to come through.
£450. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
703,"<price>15<rating>79<whiskey>High Commissioner, 40%<review>You’re familiar with those generic blended Scotch whiskies of debatable origin with an inoffensive flavor profile, right? This isn’t one of those. With aromas of the fruit and foliage of an orange grove, beeswax, and a grassy note, this is a juicy, citrus-led dram that puffs out in the mouth, bringing a tingle of light pepper, ginger, and thick fudge. Despite the thinner mouthfeel, the baked orange and bitter Seville orange on the finish give it some bite. Perfectly serviceable."
704,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>Tullibardine Vintage 1993, 46%<review>The latest Tullibardine vintage release to hit the States is another example of whisky distilled in 1993, but now bottled at 18 years of age. The initial nose features cut grass and sliced melon, with freshly-peeled tree bark. Intensifying sweetness with time. Quite rich and full on the palate, with cereal, soft fudge, and mild ginger. The finish is medium in length, insistently spicy, with oak and vanilla notes. "
705,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old Special Reserve, 40%<review>There's absolutely nothing wrong with this and out of context, its rounded, fruity, and sweet taste is perfectly acceptable. But it's standing in the company of giants, and when compared to the steady stream of world-class Irish whiskeys over the last year, this just doesn't cut it. The 12 years in oak don't seem to have added much to the story, the alcoholic strength means it lacks real bite, and the flavors are bland in this company. "
706,"<price>61<rating>83<whiskey>Speyburn Arranta, 46%<review>Poor old Speyburn. An unfairly overlooked malt simply because of its (too low) price. The use of more active casks here gives an almost waxed crayon nose, along with some sweet depth. In time, there are fresh green fruits, raspberry mousse, and beautiful floral intensity. Water produces lemon. The palate is clean and quite light, but there’s a pool of fruits in the center giving a focal point. As water makes things (lemon) soapy, I’d have it neat. £40"
707,"<price>267<rating>87<whiskey>Cardhu 21 year old, 54.2%<review>There appears to be a concerted effort to bring this distillery out of the shadows: A Good Thing in my opinion. This limited
release is very Cardhu, with masses of mandarin, dried peach, and honey, reminiscent of a fine oxidized Chinese Phoenix Oolong tea, while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth. Akin to a fine Cuban rum on the tongue, with bittersweet chocolate, dark cherry, and tangy, spicy life, it dies a little quickly, but is a lovely dram. £160"
708,"<price>2313<rating>91<whiskey>Old Pulteney 40 Year Old, 51.3%<review>The oldest bottling of Old Pulteney to date has been matured in American bourbon and Spanish sherry casks, and was personally bottled by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. The nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy, with cooking apples, milk chocolate orange, Christmas spices, vanilla, and fudge. Initially, the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits, seasoned timber, then a hint of brine, with sultanas and plain chocolate. The finish is figgy, gingery, and sherried. £1,490"
709,"<price>13<rating>82<whiskey>Black Velvet Toasted Caramel, 35%<review>Canadian whisky is sweeter to start with, and so may well be a natural base for flavors. It certainly seems that way with this underpriced example. The nose is like restrained caramel candy, a fairly deep note of toasted sugar. The drink itself is sweet, but doesn’t cling, and is crying for a bit of fizz, or some ice cream to drape itself over. Not bad at all for the price. "
710,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>D&M (Distilled at Scapa), 19 year old, 1989 Vintage, 52.7%<review>This single cask bottling of Scapa is a beauty! Brilliant gold color. Clean and fresh on the nose and palate, with complex bright fruit (peach, tangerine, golden delicious apple, honeydew melon, pineapple), spice (cinnamon, vanilla, subtle cocoa), appetizing brine, and beach pebbles, all on a bed of creamy, squeaky-clean honeyed malt. Dynamic, appetizing, briny, dried spice finish. A delicious, superbly balanced whisky that makes a great aperitif, but I could drink this any time. (Bottled exclusively for D&M Aficionado’s Club.)"
711,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>A. D. Rattray 18 year old (Cask #2075, distilled at Bowmore), 53.5%<review>The fruit (orange marmalade, tangerine, fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. Sweet notes of nutty caramel, honeyed barley, toffee, and nougat round out the palate. Ginger, cinnamon, telicherry pepper, tobacco, and ash play a supporting role. Lingering fruity, smoky finish. For those who like sherried Islay whiskies."
712,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>The Tyrconnell 15 year old Madeira Cask Finish, 46%<review>Honey, baklava, lemongrass, artichoke, vanilla, herbal stems, and Turkish delight make for a thought-provoking glass of whiskey. Sipping reveals a gentle, fruity delight; this is silky smooth and packed with dried fruits, mango, papaya, vanilla, light caramel, pleasant spices, and as it unwinds, it oozes honey and sweetness. As the honey and peppery spices fade on the finish, a hint of mint appears."
713,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Fukano 14 year old Single Cask Rice Whisky (No. 213), 44.2%<review>Stewed gooseberry, scallions, chopped chives, fine-ground pepper, rolled oats, and sweet oak combine to create a sweet and herbal dram. Full-bodied on the palate, this boasts stewed fruits, brown sugar, cooked apple, and delicious baked desserts. Drawn from a specially selected new oak cask, this Fukano is the most interesting of the brand’s 2019 releases. (487 bottles)"
714,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Benromach Organic 2017 (Distilled 2010), 43%<review>The latest version of the first certified organic Scotch whisky is a creamy malt that has lashings of vanilla, banana peel, and pecan pie aromas. Smooth, malty flavors abound. Banoffee pie topped with sliced banana, apple, nectarine, and ripe peach, with a good flare of peppery spices. Fuzzy, earthy spice, then an outro of sweet fudge. With water, more green fruit, melon, tropical fruits, and a little chili kick emerge."
715,"<price>225<rating>93<whiskey>Dewar’s 25 year old, 40%<review>Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak, flapjacks, whole almonds, and gentle background spices. Smooth caramels, chocolate orange, and a cappuccino note create a thick, weighty blend that melts gracefully into pools of darker chocolate. The mouth-coating finish has plain chocolate, dry oak, and coffee. Brilliant liquid: smoothness personified."
716,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Johnnie Walker 18 year old, 40%<review>Complex, elegant textures from the get-go; woodsmoke from a bonfire of green twigs, ashy peat embers, grain stores, vanilla cream, and honey drizzled over baked apples. Golden syrup flapjacks, vanilla fudge, candied apricot, orange peel, Quaker oats, gingerbread, pepper, and a catch of smoke that bridges into the finish, where hints of citrus and golden honeyed grains are found. Classical allure, but eminently accessible."
717,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Bw3 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bowmore), 51.6%<review>This is quite a saline Bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml"
718,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>1792 Small Batch, 46.85%<review>Initially it’s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts, pecans, and Brazil nuts, but an atypical spice appears that’s just lovely. Smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon, créme brûlée, Bananas Foster, orange, canned peaches, caramel chew, and toffee. The pepper spices reappear for a grand finish."
719,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Rod & Rifle Straight Bourbon, 40%<review>Green corn, cooked corn, roasted corn, all tumbling over each other in the nose. Very sweet, young bourbon without much drying from the oak, but no youthful fire. Tastes like a lower row barrel. Finish is also sweet. Not a lot of complexity. Sourced whiskey, from Dickel."
720,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Koval Single Barrel (No. ZT3W42), 47%<review>
The unusual use of millet as the secondary grain for this bourbon creates an utterly unexpected flavor profile, closer to the familiar notes of rye. It works well, but the blind drinker may be taken unawares. Freshness dominates the nose, with balsam bough, spruce branches, mint toothpaste, and Pine-Sol, and it pervades the palate too, which is green and peppy with arugula, spearmint, pine, black pepper, and lemon. The finish shows bitter oak but remains persistently piney and fresh."
721,"<price>37<rating>85<whiskey>Crown Royal Limited Edition, 40%<review>Starts off sweet, followed by nutmeg, cinnamon, clean oak, and a zesty bitterness. This austere yet elegant whisky slowly develops a deep complexity. Silky corn and bourbon-like vanilla toffee override distinct suggestions of apple juice, as dusty rye along with hints of dry grass lead into mashy cereal notes. Finishes with tightly integrated flavors of white pepper, gingery spices, hints of fresh-cut wood, and hot peppermint. Lovely. (Canada only) C$37"
722,"<price>112<rating>81<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Glen Moray) 21 year old 1991, 57.3%<review>Thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner, Glen Moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt, but at its best it is a very sweet, lightly malty dram. This is as soft as a lemon cream bun in a sunlit baker’s shop. Water brings out banana chews while the tongue brings to mind a picnic with baked scones and apricot jam. The only negative is slightly needling alcohol, so dilute and drink quickly. £72"
723,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Bruichladdich 'PC-5', 63.5%<review>This is a five year old expression of the more highly peated Bruichladdich whisky being referred to as Port Charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from Bruichladdich). More highly peated indeed. If you like your smoky Islay whiskies young and masculine, this one is for you. It’s like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. But there’s more to this whisky than massive smoke. There are underlying notes of kippers, soot, and tar. With further investigation, there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. What really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee, jammy fruit, and almond butter. Youthful, but not immature."
724,"<price>3982<rating>88<whiskey>The Balvenie 40 year old (Batch #2), 48.5%<review>The darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500"
725,"<price>140<rating>90<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old Beach Polo Edition, 40%<review>A beautifully balanced blend of fudge, vanilla, strawberry bubble gum, warm orange, and cinnamon, with ozone and peat smoke. Soft, slightly bitter fruits melt into a creamy silky concoction of Horlicks, white chocolate, and vanilla, with chewy toffee sweetness. The smoking embers of peat catch on the finish with a little menthol and peppermint. Robust enough for beach parties and weddings, not just polo matches. (Global Travel Retail)"
726,"<price>94<rating>81<whiskey>St. George Diamond Jubilee, 46%<review>The Norfolk-based English Whisky Company joins in the celebrations. It’s bright gold with a lovely sweetness to the nose, fresh peach, a little anise, some lily of the valley, and almond. There’s plenty happening on this light-to-medium base. The palate is clean, with hazelnut and layers of flavor where succulent fruits play off the sweet spices. This is a distillery that, as the Aussies say, is hitting its straps. For me, it’s their best release yet. £60"
727,"<price>160<rating>83<whiskey>Hart Brothers (distilled at Glen Grant), 29 year old, 1972 vintage, 53.6%<review>Like many older Glen Grant offerings, this one is from a sherry cask. The sherry, and the long oak aging, transforms what is normally a light and easy drinking whisky to a more serious affair. Ripe, heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here, but it is not cloying. It’s quite nutty too, along with polished oak and toffee. The oak balances the sherry notes very nicely, and the whisky is clean and uncomplicated throughout, all the way through to its finish. 
"
728,"<price>160<rating>92<whiskey>Kavalan Vinho Barrique, 57.1%<review>This has a seductive nose of mango, kiwi, dried tropical fruits, rich oak, silky caramels, and milk chocolate-covered cranberries. The dynamics of this cask-strength whisky play out handsomely, with an opening gambit of warm berry fruits, peaking with emphatic spices, and ending with a reflective phase of butter toffee, mocha, and Ovaltine. A dash of water encourages clove-studded orange flavors and preserves the long spicy finish."
729,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Black Snake Vat 6 Third Venom, 60.2%<review>A beguiling nose of raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, white chocolate, brown sugar, and candied ginger, with a rich meatiness that calls to mind braised pork with stewed plums. The palate sings with classic sherry flavors: figs, almonds, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, white pepper, orange peel, and a lithe minerality. As might be expected given the ABV, water may be added with impunity. From an undisclosed Highland distillery, matured in a modified solera system and finished in a PX cask. (464 bottles; U.S. only)"
730,"<price>66<rating>88<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Toiteach, 46%<review>Dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know."
731,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>Bushmills Rum Cask #7122, 53.7%<review>An interesting alternative to a traditional Irish whiskey (kind of reminds me of the rum-casked Springbanks and the Glenfiddich Havana Reserve). Flavors of toffee, light molasses and caramelized sugar throughout, with a hint of lime and spice. Chewy in texture, too. There’s a nice interplay between the sweet rum notes and the dry oak spices, with the oak emerging the victor on the finish."
732,"<price>410<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1980, 48.5%<review>A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie, and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich, complex mix of cooked apple, pine, and citrus, cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish), but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250"
733,"<price>69<rating>82<whiskey>Cardhu Amber Rock, 40%<review>Bright gold. Very citric, sweet candied orange and tangerine marmalade, with a hint of pink grapefruit. As I said, citric. There’s meadow hay and some sherbet as well. Water brings out lucerne grass. The palate is equally delicate and ‘up,’ and quite acidic (no bad thing) with light, nutty chocolate and macadamia nut. When diluted, there’s poached pear and charred oak. The finish is effervescent. Light, easy-going, keenly priced. The rehabilitation of Cardhu continues. £41"
734,"<price>62<rating>91<whiskey>The Balvenie Single Barrel 15 year old (Cask #7266), 47.8%<review>One of the finest Balvenie 15 year olds I’ve tasted. The flavors are clean, well defined, confident, and beautifully balanced. Full malty foundation (with some ripe barley thrown in). Soft, creamy vanilla, honeycomb, bright fruit (orange, nectarine, lemon peel, hints of pineapple), with emerging dried vanilla, coconut, oak resin, and subtle anise. Polished oak finish. It doesn’t have the depth that the classic older Balvenies have shown in the past, but what it does have, it has in spades. Beautiful! (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
735,"<price>47<rating>83<whiskey>Tap 8 Rye Sherry Finished, 41.5%<review>Heavy caramel, hints of pansies, dustiness, warming spices, gentle pepper, and bushels of fruit. The amontillado sherry finish gives a tannic red wine feel without much wineyness. About that finish: rather than “rejuvenating” barrels by pouring in sherry and swishing it around before adding the whisky, sherry was blended directly with mature 8 year old Canadian rye, which then spent two months in American oak barrels. Whisky purists may recoil, but the result is very tasty dram. (U.S. only)"
736,"<price>55<rating>81<whiskey>Boatwright Single Barrel Bourbon, 45%<review>Grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon, while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits. However, there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back. Needs time."
737,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Wild Turkey Forgiven, 45.5%<review>An accidental “mingling” of rye whiskey with bourbon, resulting in a product that acts like bourbon with an unusually high percentage of rye in the mashbill. It shows, with vibrant notes of warming cinnamon, fresh mint, nutmeg, licorice root, and a hint of tellicherry pepper. All this is soothed by vanilla, caramel, and subtle honeyed citrus. Lively, distinctive, and versatile."
738,"<price>3000<rating>91<whiskey>The Last Drop Single Grain 1977 (distilled at Dumbarton), 48.4%<review>Fresh pear, grilled banana, chile oil, cardamom, brown sugar, oak sawdust, vanilla, snuff tobacco, and peppery crackers on the nose. Light vanilla and caramelized brown sugar, then mouth-drawing with apple and lemon peel. A spicy buildup spills into banana peel and banoffee pie; the mouthfeel gains weight over time. Smooth, sweet, caramel finish. (150 bottles) Collectible"
739,"<price>85<rating>83<whiskey>Telsington IV, 43.5%<review>Brace yourself, it's about to get bumpy. Liechtenstein is a tiny principality in central Europe and the Telser distillery sited there takes its whisky very seriously. Every stage, from drying the barley over smoke first to the red wine casks used for maturation, is designed to make this different from scotch. You'll love it or hate it. The linseed oil nose isn't encouraging, but the liqueur-like flavors, with fir tree, furniture polish, and Rumtopf-style fruit compote have their own charm."
740,"<price>180<rating>89<whiskey>BenRiach 22 year old Moscatel Wood Finish, 46%<review>This limited edition bottling is non-chill filtered and initially matured in bourbon barrels before an unspecified period of finishing in sweet Moscatel fortified wine casks from Spain and Portugal. Sweet grapes, dates, cinnamon, salted butter, wax polish, and printer’s ink on the nose. Viscous on the palate, with ripe plums, honey, plain chocolate, white pepper, and worn leather. The finish is long and fruity, with drying oak."
741,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel 100% Rye  Cask Strength (Cask 34), 61.4%<review>As time goes by, Still Waters is developing a recognizable house style. Acetone, fruit esters, and floral notes on the nose, with lemon biscuits and a hint of graham crackers. Hot, sweet, and lively on the palate, with blistering spices soon cooled to sweet dark licorice. Hints of Cheerios and roasted grain are Still Waters’ signatures, as this all-rye whisky shows. Clean dry grass, pears, and sweet barley sugar on a medium finish."
742,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Westland Garryana (Batch 3|1), 56%<review>The third release of Westland’s single malt aged in native Garryana oak from the Northwest. Supply limits meant the wood was used more as a finishing agent this year, but the results are impressive. The nose has woodsmoke, eucalyptus, dark chocolate, espresso, blackberry, and lemon zest. The palate is toasty, with cocoa powder, berries, cinnamon, and chili pepper, finishing with more dark chocolate and espresso. A lot going on here, and it’s all good."
743,"<price>118<rating>91<whiskey>The Macallan 18 year old Sherry Oak, 43%<review>Macallan’s 18 year old expression is, for me, the highlight of its regular sherried range. Deep amber in color. The nose is rich and heavily fruited: fruit cake, mulberry, a little moist gingerbread, the bloody depths of molasses. On the palate, dried fruits — more figgy than raisined — while the natural oiliness in the spirit balances the boisterous tannins from the European oak. A singed note on the finish (an extension of the molasses?) completes the picture. Balanced and complex."
744,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 2006 (distilled at Linkwood) 11 year old, 58.2%<review>The nose is pleasingly floral, with soft spice, malt, heather in bloom, and even a suggestion of violets. Well textured on the palate, oily and nutty, with tropical fruits, honey, milk chocolate, vanilla, and malt. The finish is lengthy, with a hint of citrus and warming spices. (Cask no. 69; 287 bottles)"
745,"<price>665<rating>88<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 35 year old Madeira Wood Finish, 41.7%<review>Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014, two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978, the Madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. Smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395"
746,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Fettercairn Fior, 42%<review>Released with no age statement, Fettercairn Fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels, along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit. The result is a bold and complex whisky with real nose presence; smoke, sherry, toffee, vanilla, and oranges merge on the nose, while the palate showcases more smoke and toffee, plus spices, oak, and licorice in the lengthy finish. £36 Not currently available in the U.S."
747,"<price>60<rating>82<whiskey>Booker’s 2016-03 “Toogie’s Invitation,” 64.5%<review>At 6 years, 4 months, and 4 days old, there’s a bit of an old-school bourbon nose, with caramel and butterscotch leading. Chocolate, cinnamon, and nutmeg follow. What starts out promising turns to grain, opening up to cornbread, freshly baked rye bread, and vanilla cupcake batter. Once the chewy-to-dry mouthfeel is established, there’s walnut bread, rice pudding, and buttered toast over heat. With water, the grain disappears and malty caramel dominates. This needs water or ice to maximize potential."
748,"<price>220<rating>88<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Cragganmore) 26 year old, 50.2%<review>Lemon and lime zest, stewed fruits drizzled in caramel, granola, butterscotch, and refined oak tones on the nose. The meatiness in Cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. Light orange, vanilla, honey, and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. The second phase opens up toffee notes, wood spice, flapjacks, and ends with nougat and orange peel. (Batch 2; 130 bottles)"
749,"<price>265<rating>90<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 25 year old, 43%<review>Nougat and dates to the fore, then becoming increasingly nutty with suggestions of Demerara rum and cinnamon and underlying polished leather. Lovely dried spice notes and an appetizing salty tang teases the palate on the finish."
750,"<price>59<rating>89<whiskey>Big Peat Prohibition (Batch 88), 54%<review>
This breezy, coastal dram revels in aromas of lemon, pine needle, ozone, clotted cream, lavender, rock pools, and light peat smoke, though there’s no smoking Tommy gun. A good-weight dram with bitter lemon, royal icing, vanilla, and toffee, plus assertive pepper, oak char, and burnt sugar that pummel away like a street fighter, finally calming to an olive oil finish. This is a proper Islay whisky, if you dare. (U.S. Exclusive; 2,000 bottles)."
751,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Wiser’s Legacy, 45%<review>Winemakers have long known that toasted oak is very spicy. Today’s whisky makers are slowly catching on. Cinnamon hearts and hot peppermint add zing to a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Although the whisky is not overly sweet, it has a candied feel. Cloves and hot pepper round out the spices while vanilla and butterscotch lend smoothness as they keep earthy, flinty rye notes under control. Essences of cedar cigar box and black, withered figs contribute additional complexity. C$50"
752,"<price>52<rating>82<whiskey>Cascadia Rye (Bottle No. 97), 43.45%<review>Chocolate, honey, vanilla, cotton candy, smoke from barbecue coals, and a big whiff of brown sugar cooking in butter. Then oak shows, softening to vanilla and an explosion of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. You’re thinking this is a nice mid-range rye, but a short finish really disappoints. Its finish is saved by a nice hint of dill. Sourced whiskey."
753,"<price>80<rating>82<whiskey>Hillrock Solera Aged Bourbon (Barrel No. 12), 46.3%<review>Corn and oak on the nose, with a slice of fruit from sherry cask aging. Nose is strikingly different from the other two Hillrocks reviewed; sweeter, and softer. It’s clearly bourbon at the front, but as the flavors move back in the mouth and into the finish, the sherry takes over and dominates, becoming quite fruity at the close, though with a firm grip of charred oak. The sherry’s too much for a bourbon, especially at this price. Partially sourced whiskey."
754,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Tincup 10 year old, 42%<review>Pretty violet and floral notes lead the way, with herb garden and chocolaty oak draped over caramel chews. The creamy palate offers marshmallow and a candy store mélange of Jolly Ranchers and Swedish Fish, before the finely balanced oak comes in, meeting the sweetness with sandalwood and rye spice. A lovely effort that places balance above sheer power."
755,"<price>23<rating>82<whiskey>T.J. Pottinger Sugar*Shine, 50%<review>Not cheap sugar “squeezins,” this is mashed from 50% corn and 50% cane sugar, run on an alembic still by two Beams whose great-grandfathers were J.W. Dant and Minor Case Beam: some credibility. Clear as glass, a big corn nose tinged with light caramel and violets. Nicely sweet and warm, grassy-fresh and east to hold in the mouth. Clean, straightforward stuff. "
756,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>The Cooper’s Croze, 43%<review>Master cooper Ger Buckley has the most significant job at Midleton. Named after the croze that he uses to cut the groove for the cask head, these older-aged whiskeys give his rendition a broad back of toasted oak, vanilla pods, and cracker bread, with dark sultanas from the oloroso sherry casks. This has a richer, warm, glossier mouthfeel, showing toffee, vanilla, lump charcoal, and black fruits. A shadow of bitter oak creeps in toward the dying moments."
757,"<price>56<rating>84<whiskey>Glen Grant 12 year old, 43%<review>A new addition to the core range, this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight, but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43"
758,"<price>61<rating>84<whiskey>Flóki Young Malt, 47%<review>Labeled “young malt” because it is only about 18 months old. Distilled from Icelandic-grown malted barley as a whole mash (not a filtered wash) in a pot still, it has a nice husky, cocoa hull note in the sweet, somewhat hot malt nose. Full mouthfeel, rich grain character, dry cocoa hulls, and just before the dusty malt finish there’s an eye-opening wash of sweetness. Good potential, and an interesting character. (Travel Retail in Iceland only) ISK 7,950/500 ml"
759,"<price>32<rating>83<whiskey>Grant's Voyager, 40%<review>Molten blossom honey, almond milk puddings, and Parma violets interlaced with a fine, drifting chimney smoke compose the nose of this new blend from William Grant & Sons. Smooth, burnished orange and honey cough drops initially, then the flavor develops through more pronounced citrus and gentle spices to achieve a sweeter climax. The grain is quite evident in the harmony of the blend. The finish is long, more beeswax than honey, the sweetness finally depleted. (Travel Retail only) £20"
760,"<price>135<rating>90<whiskey>Reservoir Maison de Cuivre Wine Cask-Finished Bourbon, 50%<review>The nose is fragrant, with aromas of spice cabinet, charred oak, burnt nuts, clove, dark chocolate, and black pepper. The palate is big, spicy, and chewy, with bitter charred oak, dark chocolate, coffee beans, toasted almonds, cracked pepper, and bitter lemon. Water reveals roasted peanut shells, campfire, and more chocolate. The finish is long and flavorful, with back notes of spiced oak, espresso, and sweet chocolate. Rich, mouth-filling, and satisfying."
761,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>The Whistler 10 year old How the Years Whistle By, 46%<review>The Cooney family opened the Boann Distillery in Ireland’s Boyne Valley in 2016. A little maturity and oloroso finishing fills this whiskey with a more sophisticated air, bringing red fruits, pecan cookies, orange, apple, pear, and some dry, peppery spices. The palate has good weight and a lovely balance; caramel sweetness, orange, crystalized pineapple, butterscotch, and pepper, with a hint of bitter lemon on the finish."
762,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Glencadam The Rather Enriched Oloroso Finish 14 year old, 46%<review>Oloroso Finish has spent 16 months gaining additional maturation in oloroso casks. The use of sherry wood has lent the nose a greater sweetness, with vanilla, dates, apples, and cinnamon. Floral, spicy notes, with toffee, ginger, and sweet sherry on the palate, giving extra body and resonance. The fruity finish is of medium length, with mixed spices and white pepper. £45"
763,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Heaven’s Door, 45%<review>Crusty cornbread leads off in this Tennessee-distilled, sweet-styled bourbon brimming with Bit-O-Honey, Peanut Chews, and banana taffy. While the bold sweetness and stone fruits take the lead, there is enough tobacco-laced tannin and spice to back up and balance the initial sweetness, as char-grilled corn flavors take this across the finish line and make it decidedly moreish."
764,"<price>11<rating>81<whiskey>Windsor Canadian, 40%<review>Typical rye spices bathe in rich, smooth caramels and burnt sugar, with a gingery cayenne burn. Real black pepper engulfs cloves and cinnamon in a fiery and vibrant display, while vague tones of milk chocolate gently cool things down. Then an oiliness and mouth-filling richness sweep over a tinge of bitter herbal elixir and, yes, sawdust. This classic high-rye whisky from Alberta Distillers brings suggestions of dark fruit to an underlying nuttiness. "
765,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Glenfiddich Snow Phoenix, 47.6%<review>Second of this pair of limited editions from Glenfiddich. This was named after a number of the distillery’s warehouse roofs collapsed under the weight of snow in 2010. This was a bottling of a selection of casks — ex-sherry, ex-bourbon, refill — from one of those damaged warehouses. It is gentle and sweet — cooked pear, fruit crumble topped with rolled oats, golden syrup, and on the palate hints of raisin. A lemon finish adds a freshness to a dangerously drinkable dram."

Similar follow-through on the palate, with added notes of vanilla, honeyed malt, and hay. Gentle, dried herb and spice finish. Certainly some interesting -- perhaps even peculiar -- flavors from this product of the demolished Lowland distillery."
767,"<price>46<rating>77<whiskey>Montgomery American Single Malt 3 year old, 45%<review>Campfire smoke, fusel notes, green twigs, and rhum agricole give a rustic edge to this big and broad-shouldered whiskey. Full-bodied with an attitude, the sweet clover honey, oily character,  and lingering burnt sugar bitterness feel a bit disjointed. Pot distilled and aged in charred oak for 3 years."
768,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Laphroaig Original Cask Strength 10 year old, 57.3%<review>Pungent and medicinal in personality, with gobs of peat, tar, iodine, brine, and seaweed. These are all good things.in case you were wondering. A gentle vanilla sweetness tries to tame this savage beast, but it is no match. One of the most challenging-yet rewarding-whiskies in the entire world. What Cantillion Lambic is to beer, Laphroaig Original Cask Strength is to whisky."
769,"<price>62<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Family Collection Treacle Chest, 46%<review>The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread, plum, and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness, but never sugary; there are jam tarts, walnut, and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6,300 bottles) £47"
770,"<price>150<rating>96<whiskey>Bushmills 21 year old, 40%<review>Bushmills’ sumptuous magnum opus spins aromas of sultana, brown sugar, walnut oil, date slice, chocolate-covered cranberries, leather gloves, and a hint of espresso. The dark, crepuscular mystique continues in the syrupy mouthfeel redolent of forest honey, banana bread, nuts, browned butter, sultana, date, and blackberry. Utterly beguiling, the Madeira finish works wonders here, right through to the last moments of the smooth, sweet finish. A must-try for all."
771,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>Booker’s 2019-03 “Country Ham” Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 62.35%<review>Clover honey, floral notes, bright citrus, marzipan, nutmeg, and cinnamon initiate a mesmerizing succession of flavors. On the palate, the impeccable balance of sweetness and spice introduces candied orange peel and cinnamon hearts candies. What is remarkable is how a bourbon this potent can play host to such delicate flavors, making it both massive and bright. The creamy sweetness rolls on and on, with waves of exotic sandalwood and spice appearing on the finish."
772,"<price>400<rating>84<whiskey>Benrinnes 21 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 56.9%<review>Meaty, beaty, big, but only slightly bouncy. The nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. It then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. The water adds a note of fresh coriander. Massive in the mouth, with raisin, roasting tins. It’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness, but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2,892 bottles)"
773,"<price>2020<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 1954 (distilled at Glen Grant), 40%<review>This veteran expression was fully matured in first-fill sherry butts. Fragrant on the nose, with black treacle, prunes, raisins, lanolin, bung cloths, and polished oak. Big stewed fruit and warm leather notes on the palate, soon reeled in by spicy tannic oak, plus licorice and aniseed, though a stubborn dusty fruitiness persists. The finish is lengthy and mouth-drying, with lots of dark oak. A lovely example of its kind. £1,575"
774,"<price>22<rating>85<whiskey>Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel, 45%<review>A pleasing, very drinkable bourbon. Elegant notes of butterscotch candy, honey-tinged fruit, creamy vanilla, and sweet corn, with delicate mint on the finish. A versatile bourbon that fits most moods and occasions. (Bottled exclusively for Bayway World of Liquor.) 
"
775,"<price>300<rating>96<whiskey>John E. Fitzgerald Very Special Reserve 20 year old, 45%<review>Distilled at the now legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery. Rich aromas of vanilla toffee, marzipan, cocoa, nutmeg and cinnamon. Similar follow-through on the palate, with black raspberry, maple syrup, teaberry, and dusty dried corn thrown into the mix. Warming cinnamon and polished oak on the finish. The sweet notes balance and integrate nicely with the oak. An exemplary rendition of an ultra-aged wheated bourbon. Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice."
776,"<price>183<rating>91<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Glöd, 51.2%<review>Mackmyra has made its name on the back of salty, often peaty whiskies, but this is a revelation. It's a spring whisky, with much in common with Bladnoch in the Scottish Lowlands or peated Connemara from Ireland: sweet apple and pear flavors flit over wispy drying smoke. Sweden is represented by juniper, but there is blackcurrant, while cinnamon plays a role, too. Subtle, sweet, and sexy. £110"
777,"<price>165<rating>86<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Select, 45%<review>This new Jack Daniel’s offering is marketed as being “bold and smooth.” It certainly is bolder when compared to the standard Jack Daniel’s offering, with a mélange of corn, creamy vanilla, toasted caramel, bright citrus, and dry resinous oak spiked with cinnamon. The smoothness ends, however, when the oak grip intensifies on the finish. Adding ice does tame the oak, if that’s your thing. Still, I’d prefer the oak be more restrained. Price is per liter."
778,"<price>109<rating>94<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2010), 56.5%<review>There’s precious little reticence about this beast, which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia, Lapsang Souchong tea, seashore, wet rocks, Elastoplast, talcum powder, bog myrtle (laurel), vetiver, and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex, in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water, and when it’s added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin, but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling, it’s clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb."
779,"<price>72<rating>83<whiskey>St. George's Distiller's Elect, 46%<review>Without doubt this distillery is developing a core style, with peat the main variant over a grape, gooseberry, and lemon theme. This particular bottling is only available at the distillery, and to some degree treads water after a series of great releases. The smoke is quite light but assertive, and there's a pleasant spiciness on the palate to shake things up a little, but it doesn't punch as effectively as Chapter 11 or the rum cask offering. £45"
780,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dailuaine) 2007 10 year old, 58.4%<review>This single cask, cask-strength bottling was matured in a port hogshead. Slightly sharp on the initial nose, savory, and a touch vegetal. The palate is full and malty, offering creamy toffee, hazelnuts, ripe peaches, and ginger. Creaminess lasts through the cinnamon-spiced medium-length finish. (290 bottles)"
781,"<price>320<rating>92<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 6), 56.6%<review>There’s orange peel, strawberry fondant, vanilla custard, and finely ground pepper on the nose. It has plenty of fruit, with peach, citrus, strawberry, and vanilla which vie with peppery and clove spiciness before oak, vanilla, and caramel fade into the finish."
782,"<price>750<rating>96<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1969 vintage, 50.8%<review>It’s great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)"
783,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Orangerie, 40%<review>Compass Box takes a fresh approach to flavored whisky by infusing Navalino oranges and spices into a blend of Highland single malt and single grain whisky. Bright and slightly bitter orange peel combines with vanilla, honey, and malt. The grain whisky gives nice support and structure along with black pepper, cinnamon, and clove spice. Great balance between the whisky and flavoring in a flavored whisky that is much more dry than sweet. Finally, a flavored whisky to get really excited about."
784,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Royal Crest, 40%<review>Fairly simple, with strong butterscotch, hints of humbugs, burnt sugar, and red fruits. Lovely intro though, with petrichor: the vaguely vegetal scent of new rain and old punky logs. Maturation in once-used bourbon barrels leaves a soft, smooth mouthfeel that says “session whisky,” This soon becomes chewy then juicy, as increasingly hot pepper moves to the fore. Finishes with pleasing, fading, bitter citrus pith."
785,"<price>23<rating>88<whiskey>Forty Creek Barrel Select, 40%<review>Consisting of whiskies aged between 6 to 10 years, with a similar grain component as a bourbon (but distilled differently) and finished in sherry casks for six months. Barrel Select is a soft, silky, somewhat feminine whiskey when compared to bourbon, with gently sweet notes of creamy vanilla, honeyed apricot, toasted nuts, and gentle background tropical fruit and spice. A whisky that really transcends category and definition. 
"
786,"<price>120<rating>85<whiskey>Two Lanterns American Whiskey 4 year old, 43%<review>An intriguing whiskey, this smells like a flat, warm beer that was so good you still want to drink it the next day. Triple distilled from Samuel Adams Boston Lager, the hop notes are quite identifiable and really work well, imparting citrus, pine, and floral aromas. The palate is medium-bodied, with marshmallow sweetness, stone fruits, guava, and passion fruit, sprinkled with sea salt. Unusual, yet delicate, lively, and almost refreshing."
787,"<price>40<rating>81<whiskey>Painted Stave Diamond State Rye (batch 1), 45%<review>The first legal rye from Delaware since Prohibition includes 65% rye and also 5% rye malt. Although showing some spirituous aromas of youth, this is one of the more precocious small barrel projects (10 gallon), with its sweet cinnamon candy and rye bread notes turning still spicier on the palate. Not terribly complex, but enjoyable."
788,"<price>42<rating>85<whiskey>John Myer New York Straight Rye Single Barrel, 45%<review>Fresh oak, sweet malt, caramel, and spiced cherries flirt with cracked pepper on the nose, while the smooth and sweet palate offers up clean flavors of citrus zest, butterscotch, drying oak, and saddle leather. Pleasantly herbal and licoricey on the palate with a perky cinnamon-spice finish. Nicely executed. 70% rye with certified organic grain. 375ml"
789,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>M&H Whisky in Bloom Double Cask Young Israeli Single Malt, 46%<review>Clean fresh malt character manifests as a whole host of banana products: chips, bread, and pudding with Nilla wafers; there are also coconut shavings, sliced almonds, confectioners’ sugar, and lemon and lime peels. Though youth peeks through with heat on the palate, the bright flavors of lemon, banana, coconut, and a whole bouquet of violets and roses provide balance and lead into a clean short finish. A little more time and this whisky won’t just bloom—it’ll flourish. (1,560 bottles)"
790,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Dublin Liberties Oak Devil, 46%<review>This blend of double distilled single malt and grain has bourbon cask and American oak written all over it. The allure of spice, vanilla cream, cedar sticks, malt, cinnamon, and banana chips draws you in. Burning brown sugar sweetness and vanilla toffee meet the snappy acidity from orange, lime, and pineapple goaded by pepper and cardamom bystanders. Undoubtedly a great session whiskey, so throw away the cork."
791,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Four Gate 9 year old Foundation Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 59.7%<review>Heady perfume of violets, fresh blueberries, purple plums, blackberry jam, and raspberry coulis, along with grape soda, antique furniture, wet walnuts, and a hint of toasted marshmallow. Equally enchanting on the palate, with candied violets, grape juice, and refined oak; add water and the fresh fruits burst forth, rich and jammy, underpinned by peppery spice, dark chocolate, pecans, and more violets. It ends with rich restraint, lengthy and mouthwatering. (748 bottles)"
792,"<price>137<rating>87<whiskey>BenRiach Tawny Port Wood Finish 21 year old, 46%<review>This bottling replaces the 15 year old Tawny Port Wood Finish. After first maturating in bourbon barrels, finishing took place in tawny port casks. The nose offers vanilla and milky coffee, with peppery red berries and a hint of plain chocolate. Vanilla, toffee, orange, and spicy oak on the palate, while the finish is long and warming, with more spicy oak. £110"
793,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Yellow Rose Straight Rye, 45%<review>Sweet, warm, grassy, like a sunny day on the prairie. The alcohol heat quickly yields to a grass/mint sweetness—this is high-rye stuff—that picks up some oily rye notes as it slides into a finish that is both bitter and sweet without being bittersweet; the components remain discrete, not blending. Quite nice, and reasonably priced. Sourced whiskey (with the 95% rye mashbill that’s an LDI/MGP signature)."
794,"<price>800<rating>93<whiskey>Balvenie 26 year old A Day of Dark Barley, 47.8%<review>This bottling from 1992 was distilled partly from dark-roasted chocolate malt. Classic Balvenie honey and fruit spices on the nose, with light oiliness, ginger, and orange blossom. Rich flavors of canned pears and pineapple in syrup on the palate, with hot chocolate and wood spices. Marzipan, dark chocolate, and black pepper in the long finish. A delightfully different Balvenie. (150 bottles)"
795,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Rye 6 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 64.4%<review>Cereal grain notes and fresh-cut oak suggest some youthfulness here, but the stone fruits and hot caramel sundae appear dense and richly layered. On the palate the big, up-front sweetness evolves into nougat, marzipan, and caramel-covered apple, sprinkled with root beer spices, before more grain and pastry notes appear on the finish. Powerful and vibrant stuff."
796,"<price>653<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Rare Old (distilled at Glenugie) 1970, 46%<review>Elgin distiller, bottler, and whisky merchant Gordon & MacPhail has revamped its prestigious Rare Old range of veteran single malts, many from lost distilleries, and this bottling from Glenugie in Peterhead is one of the latest releases in the lineup. Sweet on the nose, with marshmallows, wax polish, creamy caramel, and milk chocolate. Quite full-bodied, with white pepper, ginger, muted citrus fruit, and cocoa. Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430"
797,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Tamnavulin), 43%, 1989 Vintage, 40%<review>Not all Speyside whiskies are big, masculine, and sherried. Some are gentler, as is this expression of Tamnavulin. The whisky is creamy and smooth in texture, with notes of vanilla custard, honeyed malt, and even a hint of marshmallow and hay. Very soothing finish. This is one of the most polished Tamnavulin whiskies I’ve tasted recently (and going from 40% to 43% in strength provided some extra richness and body). Whisky with dessert, anyone?

798,"<price>763<rating>86<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd Exceptional Casks (distilled at North British) 50 year old, 58.9%<review>Drawn from a pair of casks filled back in 1962, this brings out dried mango strips, white chocolate, melon, honeysuckle, and light vanilla with pepper and cumin around the fringes. Plenty to explore. Maple syrup flavors with plenty of thick tannins, but its vitality is intact. Darker, verging on bitter notes appear later on as it melds into rootsy, funky territory with burnt butter, deep vanilla, treacle, and spiced coffee. More wood with dry nuttiness on the finish. Leave off the water. £500"
799,"<price>115<rating>90<whiskey>Tamdhu 15 year old, 46%<review>Molasses, orange peel, and prickly oak spices on the nose; herbal, oily green notes develop. Finally, more overt sherry. The palate is supple, with sweet sherry and icing sugar notes, plus Turkish Delight, fruitcake, and toffee. Ultimately, cinnamon and dark chocolate. Cloves, more dark chocolate, and mouth-drying oak in the long finish."
800,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Spirit Hound White Dog Moonshine, 45%<review>All local Colorado malt, with a little peat-smoked malt. Unaged. No smoke on the nose; fresh, a bit feinty, wet and juicy melon, a hint of cardamom. Smoke is there as it hits the tongue, immediate but gentle. Spirit tastes much cleaner than it smells. Hot on the tongue, prickly. More melon and spice on the finish, a bit creamy. Not a bad white, but quite pricey. Price is per 375 ml."
801,"<price>207<rating>90<whiskey>Fuji-Sanroku Small Batch 18 year old, 43%<review>A little joy from Mount Fuji: soy sauce, five-spice powder, grilled pineapple, halved passion fruit, and the umami sensation of slightly salty umeboshi. It’s dense and mouth-coating, with maple syrup, cinnamon, and a steady build of rye spices, particularly nutmeg and clove, before closing off with dark baked orange. The spices are short lasting, but the pleasurably deep boiled orange candy sweetness persists for minutes. (JPY 22,000; Not available in the U.S.)"
802,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>anCnoc Flaughter, 46%<review>Peated to 14.8 ppm, this expression from anCnoc’s Peaty Collection falls between Rutter and Cutter in terms of its phenolic level. Immediately smoky on the nose, with oily fudge and milky coffee. Well-balanced in the mouth, with rich flavors of peat, soft fruit, and vanilla, plus a hint of brine and iodine. The finish is lengthy, with peat embers, walnuts, and more iodine."
803,"<price>21<rating>82<whiskey>Southern Crown Club, 40%<review>The nose shows great promise, with real maple syrup, gummy bears, hints of peppermint and cinnamon, and clean lumber. Tangerine juice, dark fruits, white pepper, and ginger seem somehow less than the nose predicted. It feels good, with its creamy smooth palate and glowing gingery heat. Finishes with mild grapefruit pith and searing pepper that goes on forever."
804,"<price>2000<rating>90<whiskey>Glenglassaugh 40 year old, 42.5%<review>Glenglassaugh has altered its policy of offering single cask expressions of its 40 year old, and replaced these with a vatting of casks to provide an ongoing release program, offered at cask strength and without chill filtration. The nose is pleasingly complex, with ginger, honey, milk chocolate, icing sugar, sherry, plums, and new leather. Resinous on the palate, with pineapple and brittle toffee, then black coffee and aniseed. A spicy oakiness ultimately develops. Drying steadily in the finish, with licorice and oak tannins. £1,200"
805,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>Signatory 'Un-chillfiltered' (distilled at Clynelish), 13 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%<review>Very pale in color, suggesting it was aged in a used bourbon cask. One nosing confirms it. A fairly light, fresh, and appetizing whisky, with notes of brine, mustard seed, and delicate honeyed vanilla. Slightly oily in texture. Seaweed, with suggestions of ginger and bourbon on the finish. An aperitif whisky, or with sushi perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
806,"<price>275<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box The Circus, 49%<review>Ringmaster John Glaser’s latest Big Top attraction: the nose juggles dark marmalade, almonds, sweet sherry, dates, and dried pineapple. Flavors swing like a trapeze between deep orange, dried tropical fruits, nuts, and chocolate, with the silky composure of a seal balancing a ball on its nose. Ridiculously smooth; if you’re looking for burn, try fire eating instead. Knife throwers accurately pinpoint the finish: fruit, (thud) chocolate (thud), spice (THUD). In this manner, Mr. G. will challenge the world! (2,490 bottles)"
807,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old wheated bourbon from floor #1, 45%<review>Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Gentle and easygoing. Creamy texture, with layered sweet notes of caramel, vanilla, marzipan, and crème brûlée. Soft background spice lingers on a delicate, soothing finish. Price is per 375 ml."
808,"<price>46<rating>84<whiskey>Wigle Organic Wheat, 46%<review>There's big oak, caramel, cinnamon and clove spice, and fresh grain in the nose; not a shy, soft wheat whiskey at all. Good body, supporting spiciness, mint, and young oak; the small barrel punches, tempered by sweet grain and spice. Finish gets a bit dusty and astringent, crimping things. Wood-balanced, not dominated by it. Bold, dynamic."
809,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Heritage Barrel, 50%<review>An inspiring surprise from America’s largest whiskey maker. Distilled and put through the Lincoln County Process just like Old No. 7, the distillate was filled at 100 proof into heavily toasted, lightly charred barrels—similar to what would have been used in the 19th century—that were placed in the highest, hottest parts of the warehouses. The whiskey is pure bliss, with aromas of peanut butter crackers, honey, dark plums, and gingerbread cookies. Chewy and rich, with dark chocolate, blackberry cobbler, allspice, cloves, and refined oak, it retains liveliness and verve. Longtime Jack fans will find a lot to love here, as will those who haven’t revisited the brand in years. Number 3 in the 2018 Top 20

Without water, the palate is chewy, oaky, and grain-heavy; with water, there’s a delicious Cocoa Krispies flavor, as well as walnuts and cinnamon oatmeal. Nutty chocolate and oak on the finish."
811,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>Barrell Bourbon (Batch 022), 58.3%<review>Initially, the nose is herbal, with emerging notes of new oak, baked apple, sassafras, spice, and old leather. The palate is earthy and herbal, with pulling oak tannins, while water smooths out the heat and coaxes out more spice. The finish offers some classic bourbon notes, but is somewhat lacking in balance. There are some youthful notes in the blend that don’t seem to offer much depth and complexity. (12,000 bottles)"
812,"<price>102<rating>83<whiskey>New Zealand South Island 18 year old, 40%<review>Eighteen years? Really? In what? If you're a fan of big oak, don't stop here. All the wood seems to have added is a muddy, earthy note to what is a good whisky struggling to keep its head above water. There's tart lemon meringue in the mix, and creamy crushed hazelnut, an array of spices, and some bread dough. But the earthiness is a distraction. Overall, a bit of a confused kiwi. NZ$126"
813,"<price>50<rating>94<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Chardonnay Aged Bourbon, 14 year old, 45%<review>Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after six years in new charred oak. Notes of vanilla, crème brûlée, butterscotch, toasted coconut, bright fruit, and polished oak. Clean, gently sweet finish. The chardonnay oak aging adds a new dimension without dominating. A distinctive, stylish whisky with excellent balance. 
"
814,"<price>13<rating>74<whiskey>Hayes Parker Reserve Cherry, 45%<review>Based on the Hayes Parker bourbon. Faint cherry aroma; not sure I’d pick it out without the label’s help. Quite sweet, but still; the cherry character is not so much subtle or faint, as just not there. There is some sweet cherry candy character at the very end. Disappointing."
815,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank 14 year old Oloroso Cask (#268), 56.2%<review>A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

What you might expect a traditional 100% oloroso sherry cask-aged Springbank to taste like, with probably the most familiar flavor profile of the four: rich, with nuts and dried fruit, chocolate-coated brittle toffee, plenty of spice (cinnamon, ginger), polished oak, hint of tobacco and smoke. "
816,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Laphroaig 10 year old Cask Strength (Batch 011), 58.6%<review>Laphroaig’s latest batch continues the high standards set by previous releases. More sherry on the nose compared to Batch 010, with malt, sea spray, lemon, antiseptic, and big notes of peat. Citrus fruits, sherry, brine, and peat smoke on the full palate, with vanilla and charred oak. The finish is long, sweet, and medicinal, with licorice singed over a peat fire. Editors' Choice"
817,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Kentucky Peerless Straight Bourbon, 54.9%<review>An herbal nose of thyme, dill, and licorice underpinning notes of blueberry jam, cherries, chocolate, honey-roasted nuts, and old leather. The palate is full and creamy, with milk chocolate, cinnamon, blackberry, toasted almond, dried herbs, and oak. Water brings out more chocolate and spicy heat. A long finish of oak, almond, chocolate, and cracked pepper, with a tobacco overlay. A big, robust bourbon with plenty to like."
818,"<price>165<rating>86<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Dailuaine) 1983 27 year old, 58.1%<review>The dark color shouts “sherried!” and the nose confirms. After an initial blast of marzipan there’s rosin, stewed Assam tea, some licorice, hard treacle toffee, truffle, and a charred element, all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot, with charred red pepper and a bosky, wooded note. Not a great fan of water — this is about that deep, fungal stuff — there’s an uplift of sweet dark fruits at the end, offering balance. £105"
819,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 56.5%<review>Conventional wisdom suggests that Lagavulin is at its peak at 16 years of age. However, this superlative 12 year old confirms why many consumers like their Lagavulin younger. This is Lagavulin at its very best: bold, yet complex and satisfying; full of character, with smoky, savory, maritime, sweet vanilla, and fruit notes all merging into a balanced and eminently drinkable whole. It takes a few drops of water well, releasing burnt grass aromas and more palate sweetness. The Diageo Special Releases are not known to be bargains, but this Lagavulin is sensibly priced, and the greatest all-around value from the 2017 lineup. Number 4 in the 2017 Top 20

820,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>1792 12 year old Small Batch Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 48.3%<review>A high-rye bourbon with the same mashbill as 1792 Small Batch, this whiskey will be an annual limited release. The nose offers an inviting medley of chocolate-covered cherries, pound cake, buttered toast, blackberry, and licorice. The palate is mellow and honeyed, with notes of cedar, chocolate chip cookies, blackberry jam, coconut shavings, and cigar wrapper, all completed by a finish of brown sugar, chocolate, peanut shell, and cracked pepper."
821,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Old Hickory Hermitage Reserve 6 year old Straight Rye, 48%<review>A floral nose with fragrant orange and tropical notes of melon and guava, grape and cherry, chamomile tea, licorice, and rye spice. Smooth texture on the palate, with more orange and vanilla, lemon, toasted almond, dark chocolate, and allspice. Water brings out pears and apples, chocolate, and pepper spice. The finish is long, with orange peel, pink peaches, marmalade, and strawberry, then balanced spiciness melding with fresh fruit and oak."
822,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Ridgemont Reserve 8 year old, 46.85%<review>The last time I reviewed this whiskey was back in 2004, and this new bottling is an improvement. It’s beefier, thicker, and richer, with a good dose of rye spice. Very nice! Good balance of flavors on the nose and palate, with caramel custard, bright fruit (clementine, golden raisin, orange marmalade), a peppering of spice (fresh mint, warming cinnamon, dried vanilla), green tea, a hint of toasted marshmallow, and a pleasing dried oak, tobacco-tinged finish. Lots of character!"
823,"<price>599<rating>93<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Moscatel Cask, 55.6%<review>Rich and intense nose, with paradise cake, honey, dried apple, plum, and crème d’abricot. The mouthfeel is dry, nutty, and fruity, with a silky consistency. The cask strength is more noticeable here, but as it dissipates, there is some late complexity of plum skin and coffee bean with wave after effortless wave of flavor lasting for minutes on end. Finish is hot and nutty, with moist coffee grains. (499 bottles)"
824,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Domaine Hautes Glaces Les Moissons, 41.7%<review>Bright, fresh, fruity, and clean, with a nose of fresh cream, pressed flowers, ripening green melon, green apple, and cut pear, mellowing into baked fruit tarts, rubbed lemon peel, and spice. It’s a very sweet mouthful of sugary candy, vanilla fudge, lemon bonbon, sherbet, and fermenting apple laced with a few tangy strands of citrus. A long-lasting sweet finish, with lemon and an initial spicy buzz. €84"
825,"<price>1500<rating>90<whiskey>Laphroaig 32 year old, 46.5%<review>A (very) special anniversary bottling, this is old-style, brooding Laphroaig. Fully mature and rich, it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp, oil, and brine, always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. Malt adds a crunchiness. The palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate, which is all that remains of the smoke. Pricey, yes, but rare. Get saving!"
826,"<price>230<rating>82<whiskey>St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Peated Sauternes Cask 0787, 61.1%<review>Uh-oh. If I see the word “peated” with a sweet wine, I get nervous. As a mix, this is an accident waiting to happen; a great acrobatic trick that probably won't work. Two points here: one, the distillery is defining its citrusy and gritty DNA despite the diversity of releases. Two, this also pulls its punches…but it works. Yes, it's very sweet and liqueury, and yes there's peat — quite industrial here — but they stand on opposite sides of the dance floor and don't fight. £148"
827,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Tullamore Dew Phoenix, 55%<review>Aptly named after an inferno from an 18th century hot air balloon tragedy. Kaboom! The alcohol singes the nasal cavities, baying for you to succumb, but there is underlying maltiness, tight currants, leather bootlaces, allspice, cherry, stewed apples, and damp warehouses. To taste: fire in the hole! At full power, it strafes the taste buds into submission, leaving them numb and cowering for the abatement of the peppery, dry finish. Brawn vanquishes subtlety. Douse liberally."
828,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label The Director’s Cut, 49%<review>A futuristic bottle design released for Ridley Scott’s replicant sequel set in 2049, hence the punchy bottling strength. Peat smoke, toffee caramels, fresh banana, and sliced red apple. Promising layers of fruit salad, grape, apple, citrus, and apricot are swept aside by an aggressive peppery attack, emerging to notes of bitter fruit, burnt rubber, and smoke. If this is a glimpse of the future, I’m stockpiling regular Black Label now. (39,000 bottles)"
829,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Kilkerran Work in Progress VII – Sherry, 46%<review>Distilled in 2004, this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from Glengyle in Campbeltown is one of two final releases under the Work in Progress banner. 6,000 bottles have been released. Fragrant wood fires, fruity old leather, damp tweed, sherry, malt, and autumn berries on the nose. The palate is oily, rich, and rounded, with zesty spice, then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. The spices persist. The finish is long and warming with chili, licorice, and worn leather."
830,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, 1997 Vintage, 12 year old, 47.5%<review>Big and spicy, but contrasted by layers of sweetness. Vibrant dried spice (warming cinnamon, crisp mint, nutmeg, and cigar box), caramel, nougat, black raspberry, dried citrus, and a hint of chocolate fudge laced with coconut. Very warming on the finish, with a nice resinous grip without being over-oaked. A very dynamic whiskey."
831,"<price>800<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig 28 year old, 44.4%<review>Aged in quarter casks, bourbon barrels, and sherry butts for 27 years, then finished in sherry casks. Red apples and honey on the nose, where the characteristic Laphroaig phenolic attack becomes muted with time. Dried fruit, malt, and vanilla on the palate, along with subtle notes of iodine and warm tar. Developing brine, dark chocolate, and licorice leading into a dry, smoky, peppery finish."
832,"<price>92<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1997 (distilled at Tomatin), 46%<review>Matured in refill bourbon barrels, this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. Fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70"
833,"<price>92<rating>87<whiskey>Millstone 8 year old, 43%<review>Based in the village of Baarle-Nassau in the Netherlands, the Zuidam distillery was built by genever distiller Fred Van Zuidam in 2002 and is now run by his son Patrick, who started distilling at the age of 14. His single malt is made from windmill-ground barley, given temperature-controlled fermentation, distilled in Holstein stills, and aged in new oak for a period before being racked into older casks. A rich amber color, this expression is ripe and fruity with plenty of red cherry, a little hint of fig, and a little sweet spice. Balanced and rich with a fresh citric farewell this is a classy arrival on the world scene. £59"
834,"<price>604<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company 30 year old (distilled at Macallan), 46.5%<review>Ebony colored whisky with dark aromas of dense fruitcake, fresh fig, Medjool dates, sultana, and Christmas spices of nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon, though a struck-match note lurks within. The treacle-thick palate has Coca-Cola, clove, aniseed, eucalyptus, sultanas, leather, blackcurrant, black cherry, dried fig, and raisin. The currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. This is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls."
835,"<price>47<rating>87<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Hot Box Toasted Barrel, 45%<review>The oak staves are placed in a “hot box” at 133 degrees and then steamed before being built up into a barrel. Aged over 16 years, this is pleasant whiskey (if not overly complex), with caramel, tropical fruit, marzipan, a hint of toasted coconut, and a nice creamy texture. My favorite of the two experimental releases. Price is per 375ml."
836,"<price>32<rating>86<whiskey>Copper Dog, 40%<review>Named after the warehouseman’s preferred piece of pilfering paraphernalia, the 125 year old Craigellachie Hotel’s Copper Dog bar now boasts its own whisky. It’s an appealing blend of eight Speyside malts, with honey, warm toast, pecan nut, apple turnover, fudge fingers, and orange peel. Vanilla, orange pith, wood spice, caramel, and fresh apple develop into creamy nougat. Takes a while to come into focus, then concludes with a spicy finish."
837,"<price>99<rating>95<whiskey>George T. Stagg 15 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 62.45%<review>This offers up warming ginger, candied orange, and wisps of furniture polish. The lavish and leathery oak flavors are apparent but don’t overwhelm the abundance of zippy, bright citrus—orange oil and yuzu—as the palate unleashes wave upon wave of spices that keep you guessing where it will head next. In the end, more lingering ginger and dusty cocoa."
838,"<price>175<rating>81<whiskey>Blackadder Raw Cask #6437 (distilled at Glen Grant) 1971 Vintage, 31 year old, 55.7% ABV<review>From a sherry hogshead, which is confirmed by its deep amber/crimson color. A very clean whisky for 31 years in oak, and its complexity is subtle. It’s sort of the antithesis of the Blackadder Longmorn also reviewed here. Both are heavily sherried. The Longmorn shows its age proudly, and is bold, complex, and a bit rustic. This one is clean, more conservative, and nicely balanced. You’ll find notes of honey-laced fruit, caramel, and toffee, with an infusion of nutty, ginger-spiced notes, leading to a polished oak finish. A straight-forward and uncomplicated Speysider. 
"
839,"<price>118<rating>83<whiskey>Woodstone Creek Single Malt “The Murray Barrel”, 46.5% ABV <review>Nice color for a 10 year old. Puffing peat off the glass, with briny notes and sweetness: promising. The promise is kept in the mouth, too. It’s all there: peat smoke, brine, good round malt, some fruity notes in the finish, and a nice creamy texture. There’s a bit of astringency, and it’s hot for the proof. Still, a very convincing American iteration of a peated single malt, especially at this age."
840,"<price>25<rating>80<whiskey>Grandaddy Mimms, 50%<review>Dry, dusty corn with some fruit flashing around, and an odd aroma of cracked limestone. Simple corn spirit, lightly sweet and clean, not hot (especially for 50%), and a smooth finish. As the company notes, this is a spirit for mixing, but it’s a surprisingly easy sipper, if not overly rewarding. "
841,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Kosher Wheat Recipe Straight, 47%<review>
Candy apple and artificial fruit notes, like Kool-Aid powder, dominate the nose, which overall is fairly reticent. Semi-sweet chocolate, peanuts, orange oil, apple peels, white pepper, and cinnamon, as well as plenty of oak, on the simple palate. The finish is peppery, with plenty of oak and pops of orange. A few drops of water help this whiskey hang together."
842,"<price>125<rating>91<whiskey>Exclusive Malts Irish 2003 13 year old, 54.2%<review>A great discussion whiskey for a themed tasting, this has a comforting nose of vanilla, malt, barley sugar, and creamed-coconut macaroons, with hints of nutmeg and grated chocolate. The palate brings fruity satsuma, barley sugar, and an explosion of pepper, ginger, and licorice. The tangy citrus subsides, replaced by ground almond and stewed rhubarb. Dry heat and hot pepper finish that makes you feel like you could breathe fire. (Cask no. 504; 278 bottles)"
843,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Rosebank) 1989 Vintage, 10 year old, 40%<review>Straw gold color. A very aromatic whisky, with dry, delicate herbal, floral notes. Light and soft in body. Gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front, then becoming dry with herbal, spice notes. 
"
844,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Old Overholt 11 year old Straight Rye, 46.3%<review>The grain shows itself richly on the nose, with baking spice, peppermint stick, and nutty aromas; with time, candied fruit notes emerge. They reappear on the palate, especially after adding a few drops of water, as cherry skins and grape jelly. There’s also peppermint, cocoa powder, roasted walnuts, chicory, and black pepper. The finish veers toward bitterness, with dark chocolate and coffee bean, but retains a peppermint verve."
845,"<price>48<rating>75<whiskey>Mackmyra Vit Hund, 46.1%<review>Mackmyra makes no secret of the fact that it borrowed the idea for this release from its American friends. The name means 'white dog,' but the taste is all Scotland. It's sappy, fresh, raw, and vegetal, with some pleasing menthol notes. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of it is how much like scotch new make it tastes, suggesting that Swedish barrels have a very big say in the final product. SEK 319"

The honey is immediately apparent on the nose, along with molasses, sweet pecans, cherry pie, baking spices, and peanut butter cookies. Viscous and thick on the palate, with flavors of roasted peanuts, dark chocolate, leathery oak, cooked cherries, citrus oil, and velvety baking spices, which persist into the finish along with root beer, blueberries, grapefruit oil, and copious chocolate.

847,"<price>93<rating>81<whiskey>Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Cragganmore) 1997 14 year old<review>Light straw. Initially this is quite hot and a little dumb, with whiffs of Indian spice — think turmeric and curry leaf — along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. The palate is quite intense and hot, with powdered almond, a grassy edge, and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate. Subtle, but can’t help wishing there was just a little more say from the cask. £59"

Lush, sweet notes of caramel and toffee up front are followed on the palate by light fruit, dried spices (cinnamon, evergreen, and a hint of ginger), finishing long and dry with more spice, leather, and suggestions of tobacco.

849,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2012 Release), 61.85%<review>A limited-edition (600 bottles), cask strength version of Angel’s Envy. More alcohol and more portwood influence than that standard release. Rich and lush in texture, with a sweet personality. Notes of ripe berried fruit, maple syrup, honeyed tangerine, vanilla, and background spice. Distinctive, with a soothing, velvety finish. I’d prefer less port influence, more aligned with the standard release, but it’s still a very enjoyable bourbon. Best after dinner, with a cigar."
850,"<price>170<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich 20 year old (2nd Edition), 46%<review>A departure from the first edition of Bruichladdich 20 year old, and very Glenmorangie-esque-given that it was aged for five weeks in Mourvedre wine casks before being bottled. The wine influence is evident, both in appearance (a pinkish hue), its palate (berry fruits), and even its nickname (""flirtation""). It is quite a sweet Bruichladdich, with chewy toffee, ripe berries, background pit fruits, and earthy/ resinous spicy notes-especially on the finish. A Bruichladdich fresh Islay sea breeze character fights its way through, but it is a struggle."
851,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>Four Gate The Kelvin Collaboration II Cognac and Rum Cask-Finished Bourbon, 63.2%<review>A very intriguing nose suggests brewed sweet tea, caramel, and eclectic fruits that span blackberry, cherry, and bruised apples, with flickers of baking spice and toasted almond. The palate is somewhat jammy, as sweet cooked fruit—damsons and currants—come sprinkled among more spice. Really beguiling and moreish with its dark fruit, perfect burnt sugar edge, and tea-like tannin on the finish. (2,474 bottles)"
852,"<price>47<rating>87<whiskey>Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve  (No. 3403), 60%<review>There’s a marriage here, one of perfect harmony; fruit, floral, spice, sweet, and expressive toasted oak. Then the broad genres become specific: the fruit is cherries; the floral, a hint of lavender; the sweet, an array of toffee, caramel, and vanilla, until its spice complexity kicks in, showing allspice, white pepper, Spanish anise, and nutmeg. Its proof never shows, but the medium finish is just a touch short to make this truly special. (New Hampshire only)"
853,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Jefferson’s Groth Reserve Cask-Finished Bourbon, 45.1%<review>The nose has notes of cherry candy, pink pastilles, and a bowl of raspberries and blueberries, as well as brown sugar, cinnamon, caramel, and toffee. The palate begins with overtones of toasted nuttiness, fruit notes of sweet peach, apricot, and cherry, all underpinned by vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and white pepper. The finish melds pepper spice, chocolate, roasted pecans, and blackberry. Light on its feet, balancing against the oak."
854,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel Commemorative Edition, 46.5%<review>Bolder, with more spice than other Elmer T. Lee single barrel offerings I’ve tried over the years. A bit more vibrant too. Fresh notes of cinnamon, vanilla, wood shavings, ground black pepper, clove, subtle tobacco, and a hint of nutmeg on a bed of caramel and honeyed orchard fruit. Firm, warming, spicy finish. Most releases I’ve had were mellower and smoother (the 90th Birthday release comes to mind), but this is very dynamic and vibrant."
855,"<price>455<rating>79<whiskey>The Singleton of Dufftown 28 year old, 52.3%<review>Bottled as one of last year’s Diageo Special Releases, this is very minty to start: mint chocolate to be precise, before Brazil nut and toasted bran appear, given balance by creamy oak. This mix of nuts and sweetness continues on the tongue alongside an early burst of strawberry, but the center and back palate are foosty (as we say in Scotland), or dusty, as you probably do."
856,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Forty Creek Unity, 43%<review>Master blender Bill Ashburn invited five Forty Creek fans to help him create this year’s special release. It is one of the tastiest new whiskies in recent years from Forty Creek. Rich, luscious caramels, grape jelly, sultanas, sweet red wine, and hot rye spices, with a round and velvety mouthfeel. Forty Creek’s annual releases are collectors’ favorites in Canada and the U.S. Some editions sell in the thousands of dollars, and Unity seems poised to become one of these classics. Number 12 in the 2018 Top 20

857,"<price>235<rating>84<whiskey>Chichibu The Peated 2013, 53.5%<review>Can you get sweet peat? For that’s what we have here. Very fragrant, with delicate wood smoke mixing with citrus and roasted barley. When water is added, there’s a mossy note and the sweet warmth of cow’s breath. Continues in this vein in the mouth, with the peat now becoming like hot embers. Again, citric on the end, though more like Amalfi lemon with light bite. Very good. ¥24,000/700 ml"
858,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 3 year old, 46%<review>Nutty dried fruits, pear and apple, light pepper, and an old knob of dried ginger. The sherry notes are more reminiscent of amontillado or palo cortado. The sherry works well with the whisky, bringing dried peels, nuts, golden caramels, and spicy pepper, the latter surging forth to dominate the last remnants of fudge-like sweetness. Attractively tasty, this has a finish of juicy peel, clove, and pepper. (720 bottles)"
859,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>J. Henry & Sons 5 year old Wisconsin Straight Bourbon Bellefontaine Reserve, 51.72%<review>Vanilla frosting on the nose contrasts with notes of dried flowers, as well as lime, orange, and a floral back note. The palate offers more citrus, along with brown sugar. The finish is smooth and balanced, with dark chocolate and bitter espresso notes hitting home in counterbalance. The flavor opens up with water, revealing a hint of coconut before a long finish of chocolate and baked apple."
860,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Kilkerran Work in Progress 4 (2012 Release), 46%<review>This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of whisky distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle, and now aged 8 years. Just 9,000 bottles are available. The nose is full, with over-ripe oranges, warm honey, and custard. On the palate, the oranges are fresher and livelier, with vanilla, hard toffee, and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish, which is quite lengthy, with a lick of licorice. £35"
861,"<price>20<rating>89<whiskey>Kerrygold Irish Cream Liqueur, 17%<review>Kerrygold is Ireland’s major player in the dairy business. Scored against other Irish cream liqueurs, this is highly rated. I’m smitten. The sweet chocolate is rich, delectable, and utterly gorgeous, with melting caramels slathered all over the taste buds, riding high on a wave of lush Irish cream. There are fruity notes of sultana and black cherry, expressed by the chocolate, which soar above the reliable foundation of Irish whiskey. Can you tell this won my heart? Do indulge."
862,"<price>560<rating>93<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company 29 year old (distilled at Macallan), 43.5%<review>This has the poise and physique of a classic sherried Macallan. Hazelnut, mixed peel, peach cobbler, and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. Warm, weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf, milk chocolate chunks, and espresso in support, lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. It’s increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent Macallan, so don’t miss out."
863,"<price>86<rating>85<whiskey>Bakery Hill Classic Single Malt, 46%<review>Bakery Hill has been at the forefront of Australian whisky for some years now, but David Baker's struggled to keep making good whisky and simultaneously open export channels for it. That's about to change, and a good thing too, because this is very good indeed — clean, fresh, and malty with plenty of honey and vanilla — smooth, blemish-free, and excellently made , this wouldn't look out of place in Speyside. A$88"
864,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Rye (barrel #A2-052), 45%<review>A single barrel release, selected by Julio’s Loch & K(e)y society, focused very much on wood. An oak-forward nose features old split wood, pencil lead, and rye spice. On the palate the balance with oak improves slightly from the addition of brown sugar, vanilla, and cherry. Oak intensifies in the mid-palate, keeping some semblance of balance with the sweet undertones, but oak is clearly the star. A dry oak finish is the exclamation point at the end of this riff on wood. Sourced whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
865,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>High West Bourye, 46%<review>When you close your eyes and think of an American whiskey, this is what it smells like: leather, caramel, vanilla, oak, and a hint of smoke. It becomes ever more interesting with introductions of citrus, baked fruit, and a hint of oregano; and then the baking spice and pepper follow the finish home."
866,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Amrut Single Malt, 46%<review>Made from Indian barley, the nose is soft, fruity, and spicy. There’s cooked apples in crème anglaise, ripe apricot, sweet barley, nectarine, fresh mango, sticky cotton candy, and dry oak spices. Creaminess continues on the palate, with apple, aromatic spices of pepper, ginger, and aniseed, with passion fruit, clementine, and zested limes. This should be your starting point for exploring Amrut’s whiskies."
867,"<price>295<rating>90<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 26 year old, 58.6%<review>Amber. Very meaty, with a touch of cordite, then dark fruits, wet earth, and autumn woods, cut with spicy licorice and Darjeeling tea. Water brings down this exuberance, adding iris and whole grain bread. The palate has typical, full-on Mortlach brawny muscle, with chestnut honey-glazed venison. Water bringing out sweetness, but without ever losing that glowering core. Lovers of the old 16 year old apply here."
868,"<price>80<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 45%<review>A benchmark aged rye whiskey, and it’s similar in profile to recent releases . Vibrant for its age. Complex too, brimming with allspice, clove, mint, and cinnamon. The spice notes are balanced by soft vanilla, soothing caramel, and candied summer fruits. Impeccably balanced, and a pure joy to drink!"
869,"<price>550<rating>94<whiskey>Bruichladdich Legacy 6 34 year old, 41%<review>The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965, 1970, and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate, with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. Delicious notes of coconut, soothing vanilla, caramel custard, and banana cream, peppered with spice notes of cinnamon, mint, and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I’m sad to see them go."
870,"<price>85<rating>92<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle 20 year old Family Reserve, 45.2%<review>Amber mahogany. Rich, mature aromas of vanilla, cinnamon, leather, teaberry, coconut, and dark fruit-very complex indeed. Big, coating, soothing texture. Flavors are very mature, rounded and nicely balanced, with notes of molasses, dried fruit, cinnamon, and teaberry. It finishes long, with a very soothing demeanor."
871,"<price>69<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular 10 year old (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory), 48.4%<review>This 10 year old peated expression from Tobermory distillery on Mull was matured in a single refill hogshead and bottled in January 2016. Medicine chests, sweet smoke, ginger, and apple on the nose, with damp earth. The palate provides a big hit of peaty spice, seaweed, black pepper, ginger, and dark berries. Becoming slightly bitter in the drying, ashy, medium-length finish. (349 bottles) £48"
872,"<price>10<rating>80<whiskey>Lord Calvert Canadian, 40%<review>Sweet creamy toffee, with hot and spicy undertones, builds gradually to a peak then fades into classic bitter pith. Caramels mute the hardness of rye grain as it, too fades in advancing waves of gingery pepper. Definitely a mixing whisky now, Lord Calvert tells one and all that their cocktail was made with wood-aged whisky. Hints of grassiness and dry white wine add breadth to a whisky that in days long past was intended to be sipped neat."
873,"<price>700<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 41 year old 1970 (distilled at Macallan), 43%<review>On more familiar ground with this G&M bottling of one of Speyside’s most iconic single malts, this is Macallan in full-on sherried form. Highly aromatic with powdered clove, hints of incense and fig, behind which is cacao, Bolivar cigar, and molasses. The palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. Very long, leathery, prune-like (think armagnac), and dense. A classic after-dinner mouth-filler."
874,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail “Private Collection” Port Wood Finish (distilled at Caol Ila), 1998 Vintage, 10 year old, 46%<review>Sweet, viscous, and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in Madeira casks. But the same Caol Ila DNA is here — tar, olive brine, pepper — along with fleshy red fruit and chocolate. Lingering ripe fruit and tar on the finish. Save this one for after dinner, or with a book at bedtime."
875,"<price>60<rating>83<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Loch Lomond) Batch 1, 52.4%<review>Rose petals, pomegranate, toasted coriander seeds, and glacé cherry mix it up with a tangle of Bramley apple peelings. A medium weight grain whisky with a satiny texture. Huge, throbbing, pulsating ginger kicks in at full strength. Yowser! Water knocks the fiery ginger out, but quells this Loch Lomond to a duller spice profile. A finish of ground almond, subdued gingerbread, and active spices. Great nose, but I was hoping for greater versatility of flavor. £38"
876,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Yellowstone Limited Edition (2018 Release), 50.5%<review>Lavish oak aromas display sawdust, sandalwood, baking spices, and Christmas cookies, but lurking underneath is lots of dark fruit—black cherry soda, blueberry muffin, and cassis—tinged with root beer barrels and alpine forest. A truly pretty, complex, and delicious whiskey, although the oak feels like it’s just a bit overdressed. Finished in charred wine barrels. (12,000 bottles)"
877,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Pike Creek 21 year old Speyside Cask Finish, 45%<review>Pike Creek is all about creating a rich blend, then finishing it in barrels previously filled with other flavorful spirits. Standard versions feature Port and rum finishes. This 21 year old edition spent nearly 6 months in Speyside malt whisky casks. The fruity Speysider left no smokiness behind, just spices, red fruits, and buttery barley malt. Extra rye makes for a spicier blend with a longish, dark fruit finish."
878,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Old Forester 150th Anniversary Batch Proof Kentucky Straight (Batch 03/03), 63.4%<review>
Sweet notes of grape jelly, cherry pie, orange peel, and brown sugar balance on the nose against mature whiskey aromas of earth, leather, and antique closet. A powerful palate is driven by rich dark-chocolate fudge, blackberry tart, almond, tangerine slices, raisin bread, and spiced oak. A lengthy finish offers leather and spice, cinnamon, chocolate-covered blueberries, strawberries, cocoa, and oak. Water makes the flavors of this powerhouse even more impressive."
879,"<price>97<rating>89<whiskey>GlenDronach Peated Port Wood, 46%<review>This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. Fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. £70; Not available in the U.S."
880,"<price>50<rating>81<whiskey>Dry Fly Washington Wheat Whiskey, 40% <review>Sweet, crisp nose: apple, mint, wintergreen. Grainy in the mouth; sweet, bready flavors. The whiskey coats the mouth, but more in an obscuring way; it seems to get between you and the flavors. It is quite smooth compared to young bourbons, but it leaves me looking for more. Overall impression is of a sweeter, younger whiskey that needs to mature, and the clean character makes me think maturity would look good on it. "
881,"<price>240<rating>94<whiskey>Blackadder 32 year old 1988 (Distilled at Invergordon), 51.5%<review>

An intense syrupy nose of fermenting fruit, with honey, ripe plum, grape, Braeburn apple, passion fruit, pineapple, and taffy, with flashes of cinnamon and snuff. Lush, weighty sweetness to taste, with honey, vanilla, mandarin, baked apricot, peach, molten caramel, oak, baked apple, and bananas in custard. What a find! As Blackadder celebrates 25 years in business, this will banish any doubts you have about grain whisky’s flavor. (273 bottles, 60 for U.S.)—"
882,"<price>60000<rating>93<whiskey>The Dalmore 50 year old, 40%<review>This veteran Dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry casks, colheita port pipes, more bourbon wood, and finally, Champagne casks. The nose offers orange marmalade, vanilla, milk chocolate, maraschino cherries, white pepper, and a hint of black treacle. Sweet sherry and sultanas on the early palate, with developing prunes and licorice. The finish is extremely long, with increasing licorice, plain chocolate, wood spice, and tannic oak. (50 bottles)"
883,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Isle of Jura Superstition, 45%<review>Amber gold color. Medium bodied and slightly oily. Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura whisky would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. Fortunately, this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident, but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch."
884,"<price>65<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Longmorn), 15 year old, 1989 vintage, 46%<review>A nicely clean Longmorn, expressing floral notes (especially violets) and bright fruit (lemon, lime, cantelope, plums), supported interwoven notes of honey, rich malt, bread pudding, dates and vanilla. The classic Longmorn viscosity is there, and this thickness is tamed by a very pleasing spicy, dry oak finish, with a hint of salt. I could drink this stuff anytime. G&M’s move to 46% has certainly benefited this whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
885,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Glenmorangie Burgundy Wood Finish, 43%<review>The newest whisky in the regular stable of wood-finished whiskies for Glenmorangie. Very fruity-sometimes reminiscent of overripe fruit; other times cooked fruit. In the mix, there’s maple syrup, plum, almonds, and sweet barley notes. The whisky is peppered with spicy notes of toasted oak, cinnamon and vanilla. A whisky that is lush on the nose, chewy on the palate, with a finish of dried spices for balance. This whisky takes some getting used to, and it’s not an every day whisky. You’ll have to be in the right mood for it."
886,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch A117), 63.5%<review>Here, a perfect harmony delivers crème brûlée, butterscotch, fruit, cinnamon, and rising cornbread. Right away complexity sets in, delivering salted baked almonds, cashews, dried apricot, pistachio gelato, Nutter Butters, salted caramel popcorn, rye toast with brown sugar butter, and sugarcane. Somehow, a drop of water makes it even more complex, amplifying the butterscotch and presenting cinnamon-soaked roasted pecans and almonds. Pure bliss; a must-sip."
887,"<price>4000<rating>93<whiskey>The Last Drop 1971, 47.2%<review>It’s like someone just turned up the volume on flavor. Cherry fudge, marshmallow, vanilla pod, ristretto, luscious caramel, almond-topped Dundee cake, and wood spices. Dark, oily, and muscular, with burnished orange, clove, licorice, and burnt char. Sweetness brims over the tongue with apple, pear,
and malted barley as it softens to a beautiful velvety texture. This whisky’s great journey
is over. The baked apricot instigates an eternal finish (1,352 bottles, 300 for the U.S.)"
888,"<price>35<rating>80<whiskey>Rauch, 45%<review>Riffing on the German smoked beer type. Light smoke and caramel on the nose. Very grassy front, the smoke slips in toward the middle, and it all ends up a bit confused, like dessert served in an ashtray. (375 ml.)"
889,"<price>300<rating>94<whiskey>Distillers' Masterpiece, 20 year old, 49%<review>Deep amber with shades of copper. Background notes of spearmint, marzipan, teaberry, and cinnamon compliment mature, exotic aromas of ripe candied fruit, vanilla, molasses, and leather. Thick, chewy body. Flavors of candied sweetness and ripe fruit up front, yielding to molasses, subtle spices and, ultimately, dry leather. Long, warming, contemplative finish. 
"
890,"<price>230<rating>89<whiskey>Akashi 5 year old Sherry Cask-Finished Japanese Single Malt, 50%<review>Juicy and punchy nose with highly promising sherry notes; blueberry, bramble, nutmeg, and fine pepper, with date, currant, stewed Bramley apples, and fruity Madagascan dark chocolate. The palate doesn’t quite reach the heights of the nose, but sweet fruit sugar, barley, and orange peel keep the peppery spice in check, before settling down to a final plateau of strawberry jam with hints of tobacco and plum."
891,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Jack Ryan 12 year old, 46%<review>The Ryan family has been running the Beggars Bush pub in Dublin since 1913, and historically they bottled their own whiskey. This is enticingly sweet from the bourbon wood, with taffy candy, vanilla cream, and peeled orange. The warm, fruity flavors encompass sweet orange, lime, and pineapple before a wave of honey and maltiness rides in with an undercurrent of Kendal mint cake, though the fruit persists. Satellites of citrus around drying oak make the finish. Solid, composed, and decent."
892,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Middle West Spirits 5 year old OYO Double Cask Sherry Cask-Finished (Batch 11), 43.25%<review>Delicate and dessert-like on the nose: pistachio and vanilla rice pudding, milk chocolate, cherry pie filling, grape soda, honey-roasted peanuts, and iced tea. Naturally, it’s very sweet and almost syrupy at times, with powdered sugar, orange, cherry, rose water, milk chocolate, and cinnamon; the mouthfeel is silky, bordering on light. It finishes simply, with milk chocolate, candied nuts, and vanilla."
893,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>The Quiet Man, 40%<review>The man in question was John Mulgrew, an unassuming Belfast bartender who kept his counsel and told no tales. Blended and bottled in the wonderful city of Derry, this is a first-fill bourbon cask-finished whiskey brimming with honey, gentle vanilla, banana chips, fresh florals, dusty ground pepper, and Chinese five-spice. It delights on the tongue, with sweet golden syrup, a satisfying nuttiness, and corn. A smooth finish with a whimper of spices wrestled into submission."
894,"<price>64<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach Sherry Wood 12 year old, 46%<review>The latest BenRiach core-range release was matured in sherry casks, then finished in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers rich red wine, plums, figs, and vanilla. Tropical fruits, honey, vanilla, and soft sherry notes feature on the palate. The finish is medium in length and showcases aniseed, wood spice, and fat Christmas cake sherry notes. Delicious!"
895,"<price>83<rating>86<whiskey>Talisker Distillers Edition 2000, 45.8%<review>The immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. What seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and, like Lagavulin, hints of tar. The smoke is obscured and the pepper is Javanese. It’s a polite Talisker, but the absorption of the smoke means it has lost something integral to its being. "
896,"<price>113<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank Oloroso Sherry Butt 12 year old, 51.5%<review>Full sherry impact, but the Springbank character does manage to fight its way through it. Thick, sweet notes of toffee and molasses are accentuated by dark raisin, golden raisin, prune, date nut cake, and fruit gumdrops. Nutty, briny, rhum agricole finish. A Springbank for sherry lovers. (From a single cask, 591 bottles, exclusively for the U.S.)"
897,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Kilchoman Sanaig, 46%<review>A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable."
898,"<price>24<rating>80<whiskey>Alibi, 45%<review>Alibi is a new blended whiskey: 27.5% 3 year old straight whiskeys, 72.5% GNS. A new American blended whiskey? Give it a whiff: hot caramel, a bit of fruit, and store-brand vanilla. It’s hot in the mouth, sweet with more caramel and vanilla, fringed with cinnamon and oak. Not bad, but it’s squeezed at its $24 price by perfectly good straight bourbons."
899,"<price>115<rating>86<whiskey>Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 20 year old (distilled at Bladnoch), 50%<review>One of the first releases from the recently formed Hunter Laing & Co, established in Glasgow by Stewart Laing, is this 20 year
old expression of Bladnoch. It was distilled in November 1992 and matured in a refill sherry cask. Lemon cake, honey, and ginger nuts on the pleasing nose; fruity and spicy on the palate, with a savory flourish, and a honey and malt backdrop. Spicy caramel and mocha coffee in the finish. £75"
900,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Cask & Thistle (distilled at Glen Grant), 15 year old, 1988 vintage, 46%<review>A nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. The port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean, light, and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit, without dominating. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
901,"<price>130<rating>86<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts 10 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 2005 (Cask #468), 54.2%<review>Extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. It’s diesely, burnt tire smoke more than campfire. Past the peat, there's salt, paste, and honey. On the palate it's another blast of smoke. This nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells, malt, paste, and honey. Make no mistake, the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. An uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (U.S. only)"
902,"<price>225<rating>91<whiskey>Laphroaig 30 year old, 43%<review>Deep amber color. Wonderfully complex, and nicely balanced aroma and flavor of vanilla sweetness, tarry rope, oak, toffee, seaweed, and brine. Medium to full in body, and creamy in texture, with a finish that doesn't quit."
903,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Bastille 1789, 40%<review>Master distiller Jean-Marc Daucourt uses French wheat and malted barley in his distillations and ages his spirit in different woods, noticeably Limousin oak. The nose brings marmalade, newly unfurled bracken, sanded wood on a workshop bench, light pepper, dried apricot, and pineapple. It’s a well-balanced dram showing marmalade sweetness, fruit pastilles, lime zest, and ginger, which adds to the toasted, spicy tingle. The creamy mouthfeel concludes with the spices in retreat, leaving an orange hum. Some kind of wonderful."
904,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Corsair Ryemageddon, 46%<review>A hot and spicy nose: dry rye, sweet mint, and alcohol heat. Hot on the tongue too, with the mint flashing across an oily graininess. The finish is where it finally cools down, laying down thin layers of sweet mint and light chocolate on the palate. Water tames the heat and brings out more chocolate, but steals that nice finish. Not overly approachable, but…it’s rye."
905,"<price>539<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park Ragnvald, 44.6%<review>Pear drops, green apples, lots of toffee, and more spice on the nose than in the Sigurd expression; also fresher and fruitier. Voluptuous mouthfeel, with sherry, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, and a wisp of fragrant smoke. Toffee remains in the finish, with notes of cocoa powder, smoky oak, and citrus spice. Very well balanced.(Travel Retail exclusive.) €400"
906,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old (bottled Spring 2013), 45%<review>Often overlooked in this portfolio because it isn’t barrel proof. The last few years of this bourbon have been wonderful. This year is no exception, with a bit more spice. Notes of nutty toffee, caramel, creamy vanilla, and pot still rum, with interwoven hints of oak resin, dried spice, tobacco, and honeyed fruit. Hint of barrel char and anise for intrigue. Delicious! (And actually 19 years old, even though it bears the traditional 17 year age statement.) Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."
907,"<price>112<rating>81<whiskey>Yamazaki Sherry Cask, 48%<review>No doubts from the color what type of cask this is: first-fill, sherry. The nose shows masses of bitter chocolate, fresh coffee grounds, black cherry, and molasses cut with humid aromas of damp earth, nut, and dried fruit. This bittersweet theme continues on the tongue, but its sweetness surprises, with the spirit pushing the tannins away just enough to reveal itself. If you like savory power, this is for you. For me, while it’s instructive, it’s too grippy.  £70"
908,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig Càirdeas Port & Wine Casks (2020 Release), 52%<review>The annual bottling for 2020 was matured in bourbon barrels and second-fill ruby port barriques, married together, and finished in red wine casks. Ripe strawberries, iodine, and peat on the nose. Red berry jam in time. Flinty, with sea salt. Creamy on the palate, with caramel, hot tar, sweet red wine, burning peat, antiseptic, chile, and brine. Licorice, pepper, and drying peat in the long, satisfying finish."
909,"<price>92<rating>83<whiskey>Telsington VI Single Cask 5 year old, 43.5%<review>A sweet nose of barley sugar, Refreshers candy, ground cumin, mown grass, and a trace of salt emerge from this triple distilled malt matured in pinot noir and Swiss oak casks. It’s another robust dram from the Principality, though after a burst of maltiness, it remains a linear experience of spun sugar, toffee apples, crème brûlée, and pomegranate. Water slackens the mouthfeel to reveal soft lemons, but this latest release works really well neat. €69"
910,"<price>70<rating>83<whiskey>Whisky Galore (distilled at Old Pulteney) 16 year old 1989 vintage, 46%<review>Lightweight, with a slightly oily texture. Appetizingly fresh and briny on the palate, with underlying notes of hay, lime, vanilla-tinged malt, and a hint of seaweed on the finish. A mouth-watering aperitif."
911,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Single Barrel (barreled 2/11/2004), 62.5%<review>At first it’s a smorgasbord of cotton candy, vanilla, caramel, tapioca pudding, honey, and salted caramel. Then spice-bomb reality sets in with nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, and ginger. Finally, the spice gives way to caramel over cornbread, malt, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The medium finish ends what was developing into a great whiskey; alas, much is to be desired."
912,"<price>28<rating>72<whiskey>Beach Whiskey, 40%<review>There are flavored—cinnamon and coconut—versions at lower proof; this is the “Original,” unflavored at full proof. Unaged and clear, the aroma is clean and full of roasted corn and a ripple of deep caramel. Surprisingly appealing, actually. Tastes like raw new make, though: green, feinty, vegetal, and crying out for cola, ginger ale, even Mountain Dew to help mask it. Are we done with ‘moonshine’ yet? Please?"
913,"<price>116<rating>85<whiskey>Thomson 18 year old Barrel No. 22, 46%<review>Mat and Rachael Thomson run a small, hands-on whisky business, moving toward a sizeable and successful whisky business. Truth be told, much of what's left from the Willowbank distillery is average. This isn't. It's an example of just how good the distillery could be, with citrus at its heart, plus gutsy and prickly savory notes and some salt and pepper to fill it out. Later on there's a trace of spearmint and even menthol. NZ$142"
914,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Greenore Single Grain, 8 year old, 1997 vintage, 40%<review>Light, crisp, and gently sweet. Notes of vanilla, cut hay, honey, and lemon, with a grainy, dry bourbon-oak finish. A warm weather whisky, or as an aperitif. Perhaps a way to introduce a vodka drinker to whiskey?"
915,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Greenore Single Grain, 15 year old, 40%<review>Cooley distillery’s oldest grain whiskey to date, and marketed as a limited edition. Similar in personality to Greenore 8 year old -- rather light and gently sweet -- but deeper, more oily in texture, not as crisp, with enhanced spice notes. You’ll also find soft creamy vanilla, lemon meringue, cut hay, orange rock candy, teasingly subtle bitter chocolate, and a dry, spicy finish. Whether you like the 8 or 15 year old depends on mood and time of day. I find them equally pleasant in personality."
916,"<price>84<rating>84<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenallachie) 6 year old, 52.8%<review>Another blast of new oak. Fat and creamy, with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple, banana fritters, white chocolate, suntan oil, and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. An instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. With water, some of the distillery finally pokes through. To be honest, it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54"
917,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Italian Single Malt White, 40%<review>A single malt it may be, because it’s the product of one distillery, but a single grain it’s not. In fact, there are three malted grains in this, and that makes for a punchy, vibrant, fruity, and menthol-tinged new make spirit, but with a sweet cereal note and some distinctive spiciness from the rye. Different and interesting up to a point; very well made, but still new make spirit at the end of the day. €30"
918,"<price>235<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 10 year old (2020 Release), 54.3%<review>
Malted to 208 ppm and matured in a mix of virgin oak and first- and second-fill bourbon and Tennessee whiskey barrels. The nose is fragrant, with pepper, iodine, intense peat smoke, and lemon peel. Juicy orchard fruits and more smoke on the palate, with treacle, caramel, and spice. Black tea, licorice, lingering woody peat, and chile in the finish."
919,"<price>3657<rating>93<whiskey>Highland Park 1968 vintage, 45.6%<review>A marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads, one sherry butt). A whisky in excellent shape for its age. Very clean and bright on the palate, with no excessive oak. Notes of lemon tart, clementine, plum, honeyed vanilla, and polished oak, peppered with clove, soft mint, marshmallow, and subtle toasted coconut. Clinging, mouth-coating finish.  £2,250"
920,"<price>610<rating>88<whiskey>Benromach 35 year old Heritage Collection, 43%<review>Another example of the old ‘Strathspey’ style of whisky, which predates the lighter, more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. Here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all, an excellent dram. £425"
921,"<price>234<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bruichladdich) 34 year old 1969 Vintage, 46%<review>An unusual, but very fine, Bruichladdich, with sweet, chewy toffee notes I often associate with Speyside whiskies, not Islay (although I have tasted a few older Bunnahabhain whiskies that were like this). Layers of marzipan and chocolate fudge also emerge, and I even pick up some apple and black cherry fruit in the background. Bruichladdich's ""sea breeze"" freshness rises through the chewy sweetness and provides balance and complexity."
922,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Dry Fly Cask and Release Series Beer Barrel-Finished Wheat Whiskey, 45%<review>It opens with floral and fruit aromas: strawberries, peach blossoms, dried apple rings, mulberries, plums. There’s also amaretto, dried ginger, licorice, and cacao nibs. Rich and a little hot on the palate, it’s chewy with dry-roasted almonds, cracked walnuts, coffee bean, chai spice, and grilled plums. Mouthwatering on the finish, drawing out chile heat, black pepper spice, chocolate-covered coffee bean, and dry oak. (450 bottles)"
923,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Blackadder 9 year old Raw Cask Smoking Islay, 59.4%<review>

You looking for adventure, my friend? Follow me. Enveloped in sweet aromatic smoke, this wraps you in a headlock, enabling smoke to snake into your nostrils and blow out both ears. Blistering smoky precision, with shredded lemon peel, île flottante, toffee, jasmine, and cinnamon bark. A palate of lemon meringue pie, vanilla, light toffee, and pepper conceals its true strength. For hedonists: Rowdy, with a chance of peat for all. (278 bottles, 90 for U.S.)—"
924,"<price>59<rating>86<whiskey>Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Bunnahabhain), 46%<review>The nose gives off gentle sea breezes, earthy and nutty aromas, then cocoa powder. Pineapple, toffee, and milk chocolate on the palate, with a suggestion of brine. Nutty in the finish, with white pepper and lingering lemon. (367 bottles)"
925,"<price>61<rating>83<whiskey>The Deveron 12 year old, 40%<review>John Dewar & Sons Ltd has released a 12 year old bottling from its Macduff distillery, formerly marketed as Glen Deveron, but now simply known as the Deveron. Soft, sweet, and fruity on the nose, with vanilla, ginger, ripe peaches, and apple blossom. Medium-bodied, gently spicy, with butterscotch and Brazil nuts before a hint of licorice kicks in. Quite dry spicy oak in the finish, with a contrasting note of caramel. £40"
926,"<price>34<rating>83<whiskey>Pearse Lyons Reserve, 40%<review>Hard to say what this is: the label just says “WHISKEY.” My nose, though, says “Irish whiskey.” Grassy malt, sweet heat, light pear esters. It's there in the mouth, too: smooth sweet malt, vaporous lift off the tongue, Irish light elegance, and a lingering finish with a slippery hint of vanilla. Considering the eponymous distiller is Irish... Nice stuff; now tell us more about it. "
927,"<price>46<rating>91<whiskey>George Dickel Barrel Select Tennessee Whiskey, 43%<review>A lovely nose of overripe pears and baked apple is drizzled with caramel and toffee sweetness, then veers into bakeshop notes of sticky-bun pastry. The rich, mouth-coating palate piles on more sweet fruit and tarte Tatin, with flavors of mocha, peanut chocolate bars, and lemongrass lending complexity. Drying tannins, toasted almond, and sandalwood bring home the finish. Best Value"
928,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Pine Barrens Single Malt, 47.5%<review>Distilled from a 10%, 70 IBU barleywine from Blue Point Brewing on Long Island. I’m smelling light pine hop notes, dried spruce plank, and heavy fudge; a muddled, heavy nose. Much better in the mouth: the fudge is restrained, the spruce and hops bring a lightness and verve to things. Not the “single malt” you might be expecting, but very much American craft distilling; like nothing else, intriguing, bold, a bit young, and with a lot of promise. Price is per 375 ml."
929,"<price>180<rating>88<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 7.3, 63%<review>Every month seems to bring a new Octomore. Much is made of the peatiness of the malt used, but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. It is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. This is minty, honey-sweet, with meadowsweet, some dried lavender, tinned peaches, and that hot sand note typical of Bruichladdich. The smoke is merely suggestive, giving an integrated power. 5 years old? Who knows what might happen next?"
930,"<price>140<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza, 46%<review>Recognizably Spice Tree, but it’s richer, more dapper, traveling in style, and wearing better shoes. Peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry. Honeyed palate with caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit before the gingersnaps and clove bite. It revs up with another spicy blast for the finish. A tasty fifth Tenth Anniversary bottling from Compass Box; just don’t let yesterday take up too much of today. (12,240 bottles)"
931,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Benjamin Prichard's Sweet Lucy Bourbon Cream Liqueur, 17.5%<review>More widely available than Buffalo Trace’s adored Bourbon Cream, Prichard’s takes premium cream from Wisconsin and adds it to their Sweet Lucy liqueur. The nose is sweet but not overly so, with orange creamsicle and just a hint of whiskey with oak spice. On the palate it’s creamy confection bliss, with ladyfingers covered in heavy cream and candied orange topped with a drizzle of bourbon. Rich, creamy, but not too heavy; file this one as a dangerously delicious guilty pleasure."
932,"<price>34<rating>82<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Bourbon, 40%<review>Thin corn sweetness, nice splash of mint and cinnamon. The whiskey's warm, but not hot, and it's exceptionally smooth. There's a slice of rye spice, and oaky vanilla, and the finish is clean and sweet. But it's almost too smooth, and not gutsy enough; if Stagg is bourbon turned up to eleven, this is at about six and a half. Cedar Ridge has a great start here; now show me more."
933,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Cragganmore), 1985 vintage, 22 year old, 56.7%<review>If you’re looking for a bold, dry, spicy Speysider, this is the one. There’s lots of oak here, with bourbon undertones. A fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. Gritty texture, with cedar wood, clove, spearmint, anise, herbal notes, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. A whisky that awakens the palate. Very invigorating. (Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange, London.)  Price: approximately $100. 
"
934,"<price>220<rating>96<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle<review>My review of this whiskey a few years back indicated that it was too woody and past its prime to be a great whiskey. This one is better. (Yes, bottlings do change.) There’s more balance, and the oak is in check. It’s still big and brooding, with notes of toffee, roasted nuts, dried spice (cinnamon, rosemary, evergreen needles), candied fruit, cocoa, and polished oak. Tobacco and toffee on the finish, with lingering dried spices, and there’s a nice foundation of sweetness to balance all the oak and spice."
935,"<price>288<rating>82<whiskey>GlenDronach 1978 vintage, 31 year old, oloroso (cask 1040), 51.2%<review>No doubt about it, we’re at the furthest outpost of GlenDronach’s territory here, and this particular cask has waved the white flag. It has a dense, sappy, and nutty nose which is very savory and not particularly attractive. But thankfully there’s more to welcome you on the palate, with some rich orange and red fruit and sweet candy providing balance to the savory notes, and gentle oak and hazelnuts also getting a look in. The finish is woody and pruney. £185 "
936,"<price>25<rating>80<whiskey>Painted Stave Old Cooch’s Corn Whiskey, 40%<review>Bottle 170 of this Delaware distillery’s first batch.

937,"<price>220<rating>91<whiskey>The Balvenie PortWood 21 year old, 40%<review>This is the ultimate PortWood expression from Balvenie and has been finished in 30 year old port pipes. A more vibrant and textured Travel Retail variant is non-chill filtered and bottled at 47.6%. Soft, red grape notes, vanilla, and milk chocolate on the nutty nose. Very discreet smoke. Rich plum flavors in the mouth, dark berries covered in cream, and spicy honey. The finish is long and elegantly drying."
938,"<price>105<rating>90<whiskey>Yellowstone Limited Edition, 52.5%<review>Blends 7 and 12 year old bourbons, and a 7 year wheater, in a beautifully packaged tribute to the old brand. Typical nose—cinnamon Red Hots, milled corn, oaky zest—in balanced harmony. Beautiful stuff on the tongue: warm but not hot, expansive corn sweetness that lightens the cinnamon’s intensity, some clove, some oaky dryness. The warm finish only ends after a long embrace. Pricey for 7 year old bourbon, though; is this the future? Sourced whiskey."
939,"<price>25<rating>78<whiskey>Redemption High Rye Bourbon (Batch 1), 46%<review>Aged “over 2 years” and with over 38% rye in the mashbill (high for bourbon). It’s fresh, youthful, and brisk, with sweet corn, bright fruit, brittle mint, cinnamon, and a dusting of cocoa, leading to a slightly aggressive finish. A bit too youthful, actually, for sipping—it would benefit from a few more years’ aging. Save this one for your next Manhattan. Its sibling, Redemption Rye (of similar age), fares better (84)."
940,"<price>95<rating>89<whiskey>Tomintoul 14 year old, 46%<review>Subtle on the nose, with orchard fruit, barley, honey, and vanilla, becoming more fragrant in time. Quite full-bodied, overtly fruity, with orange rind, red apples, malt, and cocoa powder. Fruit persists in the grassy finish. The higher strength makes this a standout among the Tomintouls."
941,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Wood’s 7 year old Sawatch American Malt (Batch 2), 49%<review>At first, the nose is earthy and roasty, with dried chile, cocoa powder, toasted oak, curing tobacco, and dried clay, but a few drops of water reveal dried jasmine, honeysuckle, and rose petals: a delightful surprise. The palate is savory and earthy with plenty of mole sauce, cocoa powder, charred nuts, and pepper. It’s lengthy on the finish, unfurling into cigar, espresso, and unsweetened cocoa flavors."
942,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glenlossie), 27 year old, 1978 vintage, cask #1815<review>Firm on the palate and quite mature.

The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices, soft leather, and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices, cooking apples, vanilla, medium-sweet sherry, and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish, with honey and raisins."
944,"<price>121<rating>86<whiskey>Old Pulteney 1990 Vintage (Cask #4931), 57.8%<review>Fresh, briny, and very appetizing. Mouth-coating vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a kiss of honey add a soothing balance, while pineapple, nectarine, gentle spice, and subtle seaweed offer intrigue. Old Pulteney has great potential if only given the opportunity. Bottling at cask strength and not chill-filtered really brings out more of the whisky’s subtle complexities. I welcome more single cask, cask-strength Pulteneys in the future. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
945,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Balmenach) 2000 9 year old, 46%<review>Young it certainly is. Precocious even, and a pallid-looking youth on first impression, but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-Balmenach, all chilled Muscat grapes, melon, even some cucumber. This general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue, though the weight of the distillate (Balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. It’s not about age — it’s about character. Enjoy. "
946,"<price>140<rating>85<whiskey>Box The Early Days (Batch 002), 51.5%<review>Two-thirds malt smoked with Scottish peat, the remaining third is unpeated Viking malt, all filled into first-fill bourbon quarter casks, achieving 30ppm. Peat smoke, lobster pots, pine forests, smoked fish, and some zesty lemons. A beautiful, dense texture of candied peel and sweet lemons; smoke flaring briefly before dying back to a honeyed conclusion. Water picks out an almond and nougat note with lemon sherbet. If you are new to Box, this is a fantastic place to begin. (2,000 bottles) €124"
947,"<price>25899<rating>90<whiskey>Singleton of Dufftown Prima & Ultima 30 year old 1988, 48.8%<review>Dull tropical fruits, followed by emerging vanilla, and more fragrant and perfumed
notes on the nose. Full-bodied, with very sweet citrus fruits on the early palate, which
turn to green berries and dry slowly. Bitter orange, fennel, and oak tannins in the
lengthy finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a
part. (469 bottles) £20,000"
948,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Starward, 43%<review>Vanilla pod, dark toffee, fudge, manuka honey, and chocolate-dipped banana bites greet the senses, quickly followed by a palate of tiffin, raspberry jam, damsons, poached pear, slightly bitter cacao, and Nutella scraped across hot toast. Smooth, medium weight. Malty notes emerge, yet sweetness battles to the fore. This is the taste of modern, young Australian whisky: Australian barley, Australian barrels, and matured in the Australian climate at Melbourne’s New World Whisky distillery. Unsurpassed drinkability: it just wants to please. A$83"
949,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Winter Reserve, 40%<review>Heather honey, sultry smoke, sherry, and spice make this the ideal hibernation libation. Help see off the darkest months with these dominant orange notes and a supporting cast of crystalized ginger, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A warming taste of red berries, gingerbread, and Christmas spices gives the underside of the tongue a roasting before melting away, leaving a creamy mouthfeel imbued with strands of subtle smoke, barrel char, and spiced orange."
950,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Macduff 16 year old, 46%<review>This single cask from Macduff distillery was distilled in 1997 and is offered non-chill filtered and with natural color. Melons, lemon, a hint of ozone, and a suggestion of warm steel on the nose. The palate is supple and fruity, with ginger, white pepper, and developing vanilla notes. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with citrus fruits. (Exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) £50"
951,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Sons of Erin 15 year old, 46%<review>Bourbon barrel matured, then finished in apple brandy casks as a limited edition, this is more malty than their regular bottlings, with aromas of melon, lemon, vanilla, sour gooseberry, and faint banana custard. It’s thicker texture rewards with sweet fudge, vanilla, ripe banana, hints of pecan, and spice, though it’s bedded down within the dessert flavors. A lengthy finish of lemon curd."
952,"<price>35<rating>85<whiskey>Ranger Creek Rimfire, 43%<review>A “mesquite smoked Texas single malt whiskey,” this is a distillation of Ranger Creek’s Mesquite Smoked Porter. If you’re expecting to get shot out of the saddle, surprise: the aroma is quite delicate, with light mesquite, malt, melon, and butterscotch. The mesquite strikes first in the mouth—ashy, drying, a bit medicinal—followed by the cooler, sweeter malt and melon, and a hint of the chocolate malts in the porter. Another good young (6 months) whiskey from Ranger Creek. Price is per 375ml."
953,"<price>140<rating>87<whiskey>BenRiach 20 year old, 46%<review>The most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. Base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon, tangerine), coconut, bitter chocolate, exotic wood shavings, and a hint of assorted nuts. Polished oak finish."
954,"<price>36<rating>85<whiskey>Strathcolm 8 year old, 40%<review>Spicy from the start, this has aromas of earthy whole spices, rolled marzipan, new books, and bakery shelves. Before it lays down the spices, it shows its hand with sweet vanilla, cereal notes, flapjacks, and almond paste on the palate. The finish has toasted oats, golden syrup, and spiciness. Decent whisky, though the sweetness is pegged back, and the other Strathcolm grains show greater personality. (3,000 bottles)"
955,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Jefferson’s Presidential Select 16 year old Twin Oak, 47%<review>Honeysuckle, dandelions, and roses start this floral superhighway that takes a brief turn toward grain in many forms, from baked breads to boiling oats. Then earth and fruit meet for a delightful combination that walks toward the sweeter side, with hints of caramel chew, vanilla cake batter, pecan pie, chocolate-covered raisins, cassis, black currant, and povitica. Its long finish introduces a lovely roasted walnut note. (Less than 10,000 bottles)"
956,"<price>35<rating>80<whiskey>J.R. Ewing Private Reserve 4 year old, 40%<review>A straightforward bourbon that takes few risks but also offers few rewards.

957,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Blended Rye, 45.2%<review>This whiskey is bananas. Is it banana pudding atop vanilla wafers or warm Bananas Foster melting into vanilla ice cream? It’s hard to say, but the lovely banana-vanilla combination dominates until baked pears, pumpkin bread, rye, and baking spices appear. A medium to long finish brings a bright cherry note. Price is per 375 ml."
958,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Sonoma County Cherrywood Rye (Batch 1), 48%<review>A 1 year old whiskey made from rye, wheat, and cherrywood-smoked malt. An interesting sweet/sour nose, with Montmorency cherry, sweet grain, bitter rye, and a slap of fresh leather jacket. Follows through in the mouth, but more integrated, a sweet cocktail of neat whiskey with only the slightest hint of “smoke.” The leather slips in at the finish and wraps things up neatly. A bit overly sweet, a bit simple, but good."
959,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Crooked Water Old Hell Roaring Double Barreled Straight, 45%<review>This undergoes secondary maturation in heavily toasted and smoked new charred oak barrels, but you wouldn’t know it from the delicate nose, redolent with white flowers, Asian pear, cardamom, toasted almonds, and milk chocolate; the only hint is a bit of burnt sugar and dry leaves. On the palate, those special barrels reveal themselves with flavors of cedar, black pepper, chipotle, and barbecue potato chips, as well as apple, pecan, and milk chocolate. The finish has chili-chocolate and long, polished oak."
960,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>St. George Baller Single Malt, 47%<review>Hugely floral and perfumed on the nose, with rose petals, violet candies, and dried orange peel. This is the Gewürztraminer of American single malts—sweet lychee, laced with sachet aromas that explode as if opening Grandma’s dresser drawer. The palate is more tropical; dried pineapple, canned peach syrup, and spice. This could be polarizing, but it’s utterly captivating and worth a try."
961,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Mortlach 20 year old Cowie’s Blue Seal, 43.4%<review>Named in honor of the family that owned Mortlach for many years, this was matured in sherry wood, like its 16 year old sibling. Milk chocolate, nuts, and coffee on the nose, with developing meaty aromas. Soft and slightly waxy on the palate, with almonds, apricots, and allspice. Milk chocolate and spicy orange in the finish."
962,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan Whisky Maker<review>Full gold. Oily in texture, with ripe barley, front-loaded toffee, honey-drenched citrus, fallen orchard fruit, and a full complement of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove). Gripping, resinous, slightly hot finish. The flavors don’t meld together here as well as the other three expressions, but it’s still a fun ride. (Price is per 1 liter)."
963,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 11 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 2008 (distilled at Miltonduff), 53%<review>Lime syrup, grapefruit peel, Smarties candy, ripe peach, and orange peel zested over vanilla frosting make for an attractive nose. Fruity and tangy with green apple, lemon, vanilla, burnt oak, clove, and pepper, developing more candy sweetness than fruit flavors in the latter phases. As the spiciness blooms, extra layers of vanilla and toffee are added. A tangy fruit finish with a citrus edge."
964,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Jefferson’s Presidential Select, 18 year old, Batch #27, 47%<review>I’ve tasted several batches of this whiskey (made at the old Stitzel-Weller distillery), from the inaugural Batch #1 when it was a 17 year old, to this new release. It’s not surprising that they taste progressively older. My favorite is still the first batch, but this whiskey holds up nicely and shows a similar flavor profile with a bit more wood influence: blackberry jam, nutty toffee, nougat, creamy vanilla, cinnamon, and a touch of polished oak on the finish. Nice texture, too, with good viscosity and grip on the finish."
965,"<price>135<rating>93<whiskey>Cragganmore Triple Matured Edition, 48%<review>Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you), this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot, ripe black fruits on the bushes, waxed jacket, chestnut, and a whiff of cedary smoke, opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured, with those fruits, dark chocolate, and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper, smoke, and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best, and at a great price. £80"
966,"<price>33<rating>80<whiskey>Red River Canadian Style Whiskey, 40%<review>Well, they got the proof right! From JEM Beverage (Carrollton, Texas). Sweet cedar and citrus in the nose, dominant and one-noted. Sweet on the tongue, with that fresh green cedar character and more sweet citrus; a touch of oak in the finish. Not a lot else."
967,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Jameson Select Reserve Black Barrel, 40%<review>Bright sparks, these Jameson guys. This takes all the worldwide quality and balance of the standard bottle and adds a large dollop of pot still whiskey, providing plummy, rich fruits to the mix. They may have also upped the effects of oak, too, so there's an extra depth to the whiskey. Fans of the brand will love it, and pot still whiskey fans will appreciate an affordable full-flavored blend. (Value Pick)"
968,"<price>5285<rating>92<whiskey>Balvenie 1982 vintage, 51.1%<review>Fleeting green foliage on the early nose, then orange blossom and fragrant spices emerge, with vanilla that’s cut through by lemon. Big, fresh orange notes on the palate, with brittle toffee, and encroaching dark chocolate. The finish is long, with lingering chocolate, spicy oak, and citrus fruit. £4,000"
969,"<price>169<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Highland Park) 18 year old cask #0074, 48.4%<review>The Old Particular non-chill filtered single cask expression of Highland Park was distilled in November 1995, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in December 2013. The outturn was 322 bottles. Initially quite reticent on the nose, then toffee, cardboard, table salt, and very faint smoke. Quite viscous on the palate, and dry peat becomes relatively prominent, with allspice and sea salt. The finish offers licorice and lingering spices. £100"
970,"<price>43<rating>83<whiskey>Cardhu, 12 year old, 40%<review>This soft, bright, easy-going whisky is back in the U.S. after being absent for several years. Very fragrant, with vibrant fruit (nectarine, plum, guava, pineapple, clementine), honeyed vanilla, and subtle macadamia. Fairly light (a pre-dinner or leisurely afternoon malt, perhaps?), but evenly balanced. A gentle introduction to single malts for the blended scotch drinker. "
971,"<price>52<rating>80<whiskey>Draymans Highveld, 43%<review>The distillery makes big claims for this whisky, stressing that it shares the same high production values as Scotland, and the importance of altitude in the Highveld to maturation. This is the first whisky release from a Pretoria brewery, and it is fascinating. The nose is confused, but the palate is liqueur-like, with blackcurrant cordial and Vimto [a UK fruit-herb soda]. Its problem is its youth. It’s not yet fully integrated, and there are immature rootsy notes here, but it’s promising. €36 Currently not available in the U.S. "
972,"<price>379<rating>90<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1990 (Cask #1362), 51.4%<review>Although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225"
973,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label 12 year old, 40%<review>Need you ask? An unmistakable classic and an exemplar of a blended Scotch whisky, famous around the world. Toffee, swirling caramel, whole almond, and mashed banana amid twisting white smoke. The palate has such poise, balance, and dexterity that it sets the standard for many less accomplished blends to aspire to. Conspicuously iconic, and the closest thing you will find to a complete whisky at this price."
974,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Arran The Devil’s Punch Bowl Chapter II: Angels & Devils, 53.1%<review>Chapter II of Arran’s The Devil’s Punch Bowl embraces whisky from a total of 27 casks. These are seventeen oloroso sherry hogsheads (from 1997 and ’98), six standard bourbon barrels (2002), and four peated bourbon casks (2004). Juicy dark berries, malt, and soft cinnamon on the nose. Robust and fruity on the palate, with more dark berries, plain chocolate, a suggestion of vanilla, and black pepper. Long and drying in the earthy, mildly smoky finish, with aniseed and licorice."
975,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Cambus) 25 year old 1991, 62%<review>A single cask from a refill hoggie, this bursts with vanilla fudge, cracked peppercorn, wood shavings, and apple strudel. Incredibly fruity, with mouth-watering gummy bears, tangy orange, and dried pineapple, evolving from sweet fruits through to banana chews. Diluting down from its considerable cask strength only pumps up the juiciness. To conclude, a long, creamy finish like a banana shake. Evidently, terrific cask selection at work. (K&L Wines exclusive, 246 bottles)"
976,"<price>1200<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 25 year old, 50.9%<review>This cask strength, sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather, tropical fruits, brittle toffee, and brine, backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich, well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat, brine, muted sherry, figs, gentle spices, tangerines, and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long, gently smoky, malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8,000 bottles)"
977,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>The Silkie, 40%<review>Folklore tells of the Silkies, whose siren voices and beckoning, limpid eyes were irresistible to any man. From the team planning to build Sliabh Liag Distillery in County Donegal comes a palate of vanilla fudge, wood spices, and some vegetal notes following a nose of cold toffee brittle, fresh-cut herbs, and white pepper. A conspicuous grain character penetrates through, but this adds to a mature profile, making this blend stand out from the crowd of bourbon cask sweeties. €47"
978,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Ardbeg An Oa, 46.6%<review>Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans, but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa, matured in a combination of virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and bourbon barrels, and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling, marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness, but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat, black tea, and peppery cloves. Die-hard Ardbeg fans should have no complaints, and new converts have a real treat in store. Number 6 in the 2017 Top 20

979,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>O'Danagher's American (Batch 1), 45%<review>This Dry Fly Distilling project is made from grains grown in Washington by farmer Tim O'Danaher [note that different spellings are correct]. Off to a good start: a luxuriously sweet cereal aroma puffs out of the glass as I pour, and adds softened dried fruits and hard candy when actively nosed. The new American oak (53-gallon barrel) is evident immediately, tempering the sweetness with spice, walnuts, and a hard woodiness. Finish is long, balanced, enticing. Definitely enjoyable as a sipper; an interesting new direction."
980,"<price>625<rating>86<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Aged 37 Years, 56%<review>Glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently, including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for North America, under the Master Distillers Selection banner. Initially, cornflakes and sherry on the nose, with developing vanilla and soft toffee. Becoming very sweet. Rich and notably spicy on the palate, with dates and dark chocolate. Persistently spicy in the finish, with background citrus fruits."
981,"<price>30<rating>78<whiskey>Crown Royal Black, 45%<review>Not exactly black. (More like russet, but Crown Royal Russet isn’t as catchy.) It’s nice to see the higher strength, and there’s definitely more flavor here than the standard Crown Royal or Crown Royal Reserve. But it’s missing the smoothness and elegance I cherish in other Crown Royal whiskies. Notes of molasses and maple syrup, accentuated by burnt fig, hints of pedro ximenez sherry, and raisin. There are suggestions of dark rum and bourbon in here. (Perhaps an alternative to both?) A whisky to drink on the rocks or as a mixer."
982,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>The Irishman Founder’s Reserve, 40%<review>This is a 70/30 blend of aged single malt whiskey and single pot still whiskey (though no grain whiskey), matured in bourbon barrels for around 7 to 9 years. Revel in the spicy aromas of clove, cinnamon, and star anise balanced with green apple, blossom honey, and dry, oily vanilla pods. The mouthfeel is weighty and dense from the pot still, yet rich in honey, spice, and vanilla, with a tongue-enveloping finish of custard cream biscuits."
983,"<price>185<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular Ledaig 1993 (distilled at Tobermory), 50.9%<review>This 21 year old from Tobermory is of the peated Ledaig variety, though sampling confirms that the level of peating in Ledaig malt has been significantly ramped up since this was produced. Sweet on the nose, with subtle aromatic smoke, unsalted butter, peaches in syrup, and heather honey. Luscious and viscous on the sweet, fruity palate, with honey, underlying soft spices, and some gentle smoke. Slowly drying in the finish to licorice root and black coffee. £110"
984,"<price>189<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Tormore) 1988 Floral Trellis, 46%<review>The nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. Opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. The palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. Instead of Tormore’s normal nagging rigidity, this flows sweetly over the tongue, leaving fruit leather, stewed rhubarb, and with water, rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. A lovely Tormore! £118"
985,"<price>250<rating>79<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage (distilled Spring 1991) 24 year old, 50%<review>Take just a moment to admire the color; it’s nearly red after 24 years. Then admire the fragrance, with florals, fruit, caramel, and vanilla bargaining for their time over prominent oak. Complexity of earth, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, bitter chocolate, light cinnamon, sautéed mushrooms, watermelon Jolly Rancher, and a hint of tobacco. Eventually, woodiness and bitterness set in and dominate the palate. Too much wood."
986,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Glenlivet) 25 year old 1980 vintage (Cask #13735), 53.9%<review>Very fragrant. Spicy too, with notes of honeyed vanilla, peaches in cream, butterscotch, cinnamon, licorice (red and black), light nuttiness, and toasted oak on the finish. Nice mouthfeel, well-balanced, and quite rich for such an elegant whisky."
987,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>Black Bull, 30 year old, 50%<review>Well, what have we here? A blend of 50% malt and 50% grain (a very high malt content for a blend), and bottled at 50%, too! The whisky was blended first (very unusual), before being aged in sherry casks for its entire life. Antique amber/chestnut color. Full sherry impact, but never cloying -- the higher alcohol level and grain whisky cut through the sherry and add balance and drinkability. This is a fruity-confection delight, with raisin chutney, fig cake, orange almond scone, and chocolate-covered cherry. Add to the mix richly textured toffee, old oak, polished leather, and a cinnamon-spiced tobacco finish. A rare treat! A great old blend that malt drinkers will embrace."
988,"<price>11<rating>78<whiskey>Hunter Rye, 45%<review>A version of the classic Canadian Hunter from Sazerac, this is a very enjoyable whisky for sipping on ice or with a simple mixer. A dry nose is a bit closed showing soft spirit, caramel, and hints of maple. The sweet, hot, and slightly pulling palate has a grapefruit juice sharpness that keeps it fresh. Maple syrup sweetens a hot, longish finish that has the feel of black licorice. Simple, fun whisky."
989,"<price>975<rating>90<whiskey>The Dalmore 25 year old, 42%<review>Dalmore 25 year old comprises spirit matured initially in American oak casks, some of which is then transferred into first-fill bourbon barrels, while the remainder goes into Palomino fino sherry butts. The two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes. Vanilla, figs, toffee, and ripe oranges on the festive nose, while the palate features more orange, peaches, milk chocolate, and sherry. The chocolate darkens in the lengthy finish, with ginger and licorice."
990,"<price>250<rating>85<whiskey>Jefferson’s Presidential Select 30 year old, 45.2%<review>A thick, heavyweight bourbon. Older doesn’t always taste older, and this 30 year old Jefferson’s tastes younger than its sibling 25 year old. The influence of 30 years in oak is evident with its polished leather, tobacco, and charred oak. However, there’s a surprising sweetness that props up the oak with maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon roll, and vanilla cream. Very even-keeled. Yes, it tastes old, but with redeeming qualities. Dark and mysterious in personality."
991,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Exclusive Regions Islay (undisclosed Islay single malt), 50%<review>A non-chill filtered single cask bottling from The Creative Whisky Co. This is a classic ‘full-on’ yet well-balanced Islay, with a nose of sweet peat, lemongrass, iodine, and brine. Ultimately, a whiff of aromatic pipe tobacco. Sweet fruit notes on the palate, developing smoky peat, and barbecued meat. Long in the finish, with spicy licorice, chili, and peat embers."
992,"<price>46<rating>92<whiskey>New Riff Bottled in Bond Rye, 50%<review>New Riff’s first whiskey releases were all bottled in bond from the start—a bold move for a brand new distillery. This rye proves it was the right decision. Complex and compelling, it shows maturity while retaining liveliness and verve. Grassy and herbal on the nose, it also has orange, cedar, sassafras, rose petals, and syrupy blackberries. The medium-weight palate balances clove, cedar oil, orange, berries, bubble gum, and cinnamon, which melt into an herbaceous, nutty, chocolate-rich finish. The patient drinker is rewarded, as aromas and flavors develop beautifully in the glass. Number 17 in the 2019 Top 20"
993,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach 25 year old, 46.8%<review>This expression was aged in remade American oak bourbon hogsheads and French oak Burgundy barriques. Floral aromas on the early nose, with classic BenRiach spicy honey and apple juice emerging, along with vanilla and white pepper. The palate is full and rich, with almonds, more honey, port wine, apple pie, sweet oak, and cocoa powder. The finish is luxurious, with oak tannins and persistent wine notes."
994,"<price>53<rating>92<whiskey>Canadian Rockies 21 year old (batch 2), 46%<review>When Thomas Chen introduced Canadian Rockies in Taiwan, he chose Highwood Distillers in High River, Alberta, to supply a delicate yet fragrant, fruit-laden whisky that would please the Taiwanese palate. Now launching in Canada, Chen upped the bottling strength to 46% to boost the flavor. The complex, exotic fruit salad and faint lilac-like flowers that characterized the original remain, along with blistering white pepper, sweet oak caramels, and crisp, clean barrel notes on a luxurious, creamy palate. (Canada only) C$69"
995,"<price>35<rating>74<whiskey>Backbone Prime Blended Bourbon (batch 3), 52%<review>Up front it is extremely off-putting, with overwhelming medicinal, musk, and anise notes, but herbs, candied fruit, and shrubs offer a semblance of hope. Finally, caramel and vanilla appear, though short, overtaken by raw sweet corn and oats. Grain doesn’t go away; it almost masks specks of brown sugar and citrus before a short finish with an unrelenting bitterness."
996,"<price>350<rating>94<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blue Label Legendary Eight, 43.8%<review>
A blend of eight whiskies including Oban, Brora, Cambus, and Lagavulin, producing a sweet yet complex dram that may surprise regular Blue Label drinkers. The nose has peach, marmalade, brown sugar sprinkled on caramel, fine pepper, soft peatiness, oiled wood, and campfire smokiness. The sugary palate yields toffee apple, fudge, vanilla, dried fruit, peach, and gentle spice, then fiery smoke, pepper, cocoa, milky coffee, and chocolate. Legendary indeed."
997,"<price>72<rating>87<whiskey>The Dalmore Valour, 40%<review>The Dalmore has added a new expression to its Travel Retail portfolio, namely Valour. This variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. The result is a nose of black currants, caramel, and musty sherry. The palate is medium-sweet, with damsons, Jaffa oranges, and printer’s ink. Dark berries emerge in time. The finish embraces drying spices, figs, and mildly astringent oak."
998,"<price>125<rating>93<whiskey>Little Book Chapter 3 “The Road Home,” 61.3%<review>The chewy caramel aroma is bursting with all types of vanilla—frosted birthday cake, Nilla wafer, and pudding—along with honey-roasted peanuts and dark berry. On the palate, deep fruit and an explosion of spice flavors, including nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. For all its power, this whiskey remains impressively sippable, although it shows a more elegant side with some water added. A blend of 9 year old Knob Creek and Basil Hayden’s, 11 year old Booker’s, and 12 year old Baker’s bourbons, bottled at barrel proof and unfiltered."
999,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey American Spirit 15 year old, 50%<review>A clean, well-rounded bourbon packed with flavor. Deep amber, with tinges of gold. Rich, silky aromas, with thickly textured, seamless flavors on the palate. Incredibly smooth, too, with interwoven notes of toffee, molasses, creamy vanilla, and candy corn. Underlying lush fruit, cinnamon, and fresh mint -- especially on the finish -- round everything out. Some of the previous “extra matured” Wild Turkey whiskeys have occasionally shown their age on the finish, being a little heavy on the oak. Not this one. Nicely done."
1000,"<price>71<rating>88<whiskey>Spirit of Yorkshire Filey Bay Second Release, 46%<review>Spirit of Yorkshire Distillery has two Forsyths pot stills and a four-plate copper
column, giving them plenty of options. An encouraging step toward their flagship
single malt, this lemon-pale dram evokes aromas of lemon, herb gardens, clotted
cream, marshmallow, and a little vanilla. It’s sweet as candy, with flavors of sugared
almonds, Sweethearts, butter icing, candied lemon peel, pancakes, and a finish of
peppery arugula leaves. (6,000 bottles) £55"
1001,"<price>130<rating>85<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection American Oak, 42.5%<review>The nose is a bit hot and generally restrained, with dried leaves, earthiness, and waxy crayons. Light-bodied, very soft, and somewhat juicy. Stone fruit and grain flavors combine for an enjoyable peach-pie quality before the tannic finish."
1002,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Cuatro Series Pedro Ximenez, 46%<review>Full sherry and old leather on the nose. Dried fruits, and finally a hint of meat extract. Rich, sweet, and sherried on the palate, with nutty spices. Medium to long in the spicy finish, with black currant and raisin notes."
1003,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>The Lakes The One Sherry Cask-Finished, 46.6%<review>

Dark and mysterious, with prune juice, leather boots, aniseed, Brazil nut, and tobacco. There’s oloroso and PX influence on the palate, with prune, dried fig, baked orange, dark muscovado, chocolate-covered toffee, and hazelnut, with a finish of cocoa and smoky espresso notes. It nearly has the body and texture to sustain these heavy-duty flavors, but it’s a bit like a skinny kid in a leather jacket trying to act tough. £48"
1004,"<price>135<rating>84<whiskey>Lark Para, 43%<review>Lark Distillery celebrates its 20th year in 2012 and it's starting to settle on a house style: big apple fruity whiskey with menthol, candy cough drop, and hickory notes, and some red berry fruits from maturation in quarter casks made from port barrels. This special bottling uses casks made of wood that held 100 year old Para Port, among the world's finest. All the Lark traits are there, with a liqueur-like bonus. Intriguing. $AUS 132"
1005,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Balcones Lineage Texas (Batch SML 20-1), 47%<review>From the first sniff, this whiskey defines itself as intense and full-flavored: candied kiwi, papaya, mango, pineapple, and jackfruit crowd out almost all other aromas, though if it sits for a while, brown sugar and pecans emerge. The palate is consistent, with plenty of tropical fruit but also cocoa powder, oak, and dry nuttiness. More pineapple, kiwi, and jackfruit on the finish, but they fade fairly quickly to allow vanilla bean and dry oak to shine."
1006,"<price>73<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Caol Ila) 6 year old, 46%<review>Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50"
1007,"<price>49<rating>83<whiskey>Ledaig 10 year old, 46.3%<review>Tobermory’s peated offering. Great to see Ledaig hitting its stride, with a brisk punch of peat and not chill-filtered. There’s a bit of a raw edge too, quite bracing but still plenty of soothing sweetness. Earthy peat smoke, ripe barley, honeyed vanilla, bourbon barrel char, black licorice stick, espresso bean, olive brine, and suggestions of beef jerky. In some respects, it even tastes younger than 10 years old, but I’m balancing that with bonus points for distinctiveness."
1008,"<price>108<rating>89<whiskey>Arran Malt The Millennium Casks, 53.5%<review>The Millennium Casks is a non-chill filtered vatting of 45 Arran casks filled on December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000; 35 bourbon barrels and 10 sherry hogsheads. A spicy, floral nose with sherry, honey, coconut ice, orange, fudge, and ultimately raisin notes. Smooth and luscious on the palate, with apple pie and custard, plus a sprinkling of cinnamon. Long and spicy in the finish, with oranges, a hint of black pepper, licorice, and drying oak. (7,800 bottles). £65"
1009,"<price>89<rating>88<whiskey>The Macallan Classic Cut (2017 Edition), 58.4%<review>Released exclusively for the U.S., this is the first bottling in an annual series celebrating what Macallan terms its “…unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit.” Matured in oloroso sherry-seasoned American and European oak casks. Confident Christmas cake aromas, plus quite assertive oak. Honey, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, ginger, and lively oak on the palate. Gingery wood notes in the medium-length finish."
1010,"<price>28<rating>88<whiskey>Black Velvet Onyx 12 year old. 40%<review>Dry and mildly dusty on first nosing, with a touch of pine pitch and red cedar. Tingling peppery spices and barrel notes carry onto the palate, bringing a slightly bitter counterpoint to luscious crème brûlée. Vanilla and hints of real maple syrup nuance apple pie sprinkled with baking spices, ripe black fruits, and a toffeeish but clean finish. Complex and beautifully integrated. Labeled 12 years old, Onyx includes some older whisky as well. (Europe exclusive) €27"
1011,"<price>19<rating>84<whiskey>Ezra Brooks, 45%<review>Distilled and aged in Indiana, it’s herbal, floral, and slightly fruity, with a hint of cherry syrup. Resounding dried apricot and peach cobbler are followed by concentrated caramel and vanilla, creating a very pleasing and easy-drinking whiskey. Although not complex nor with a strong finish, it’s perfectly balanced by intense notes. Perfect for cocktails or table whiskey."
1012,"<price>300<rating>95<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Bluebell Forest, 55.3%<review>Season 2 of Dair Ghaelach sees the action switch to six Irish oaks felled in a County Kilkenny bluebell forest. The balance of spice, toasted oak, and sweetness on the nose from tree one is singularly good, though clementine and grapefruit peel also clamor for attention. The acidity of the citrus collides with crunchy pot still spices, and grapefruit evolves into the most delicious ripe mango flavor. Simply heavenly."
1013,"<price>84<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Vintage Malt Ginger Compote, 1996, 46%<review>The Wemyss range — overseen by Susan Colville — has been quietly building a deserved reputation for being among the most consistently enjoyable single cask bottlings. This new example hails from the mighty Benrinnes distillery, but shows a milder side to its make — there is indeed ginger aplenty, along with cumin, crystallized fruit, and jellied peach, but behind is a deep earthy and slightly leathery note typical of ‘The Ben.’ It’s these bass notes that dominate on the richly chewy palate. Best neat. £51 "
1014,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Crooked Water Regatta Rum Finish Rye, 47.5%<review>Three and half year old rye finished in rum casks from Barbados. Rum-influenced notes of ripe mango, guava, and orange curaçao dominate the nose. A light, nimble mouthfeel with rum sweetness on the palate, plus candied mandarin, lemon, pineapple, and a light pine note. Similar notes on the finish, helped by a sprinkling of white pepper. Flavorful and rich, with the overlay of rum sweetness dominating the rye notes to some degree."
1015,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Ben Nevis), Cask #7438, 31 year old, 1975 vintage, 58.4%<review>Very traditional West Highland style: somewhat rustic, muscular, and oily in texture, with notes of leather, bourbon, espresso, orange peel, kiwi, and a suggestion of ultra-aged Caribbean rum. Occasionally, a softer side of vanilla and coconut shows itself, but, if this whiskey were a man, he would be a lumberjack. 
"
1016,"<price>325<rating>81<whiskey>Charbay Hop Flavored Whiskey, Batch #2, 55%<review>A unique and quite intriguing whiskey. A “bottle ready” California pilsner beer was given an extra dose of hops, then distilled in a pot still and aged in new oak for six years. Then it was “aged” in stainless steel for another three years. Five barrels were bottled. When I traveled through Europe, some of the breweries let me taste “Hop Schnapps” they’d had a distiller produce from their own beer. It was always just for their own private consumption, not for sale. This Charbay release reminds me of that, only aged into a mature whiskey. It’s a complex whiskey, naturally accentuated by hops, exotic teas, marijuana (seriously!), candied fruit, lavender, dark berries, raspberry (red and black), juniper, freshly ground tellicherry pepper, and light Caribbean rum. A nice “change of pace” whiskey.
"
1017,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Tomatin, 18 year old, 46%<review>A new, beefed-up version of the 18 year old, with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. I must say that I really enjoyed the previous expression, rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. I like this one too, and its bold demeanor. Whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. Notes of toffee apple, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, date nut cake, ripe fruit, and roasted nuts, all dusted with cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa."
1018,"<price>133<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts ‘Rum ‘n’ Raisin’ Single Cask, 46%<review>Produced at Tullibardine distillery in 1989, this ex-bourbon hogshead has yielded 299 bottles. The expression lives up to its name with rum and raisin ice cream on the nose; floral, with glacé cherries, dried apricots, and pistachio nuts. More nuts and lots of spice on the palate, plus dark chocolate, dates, and prunes. The finish is medium in length, with spicy, benign oak. £85"
1019,"<price>81<rating>88<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Peated Port Wood Finish, 46%<review>Glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished whiskies, matured for an unspecified period in first- fill American oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. This is the pick of the quartet of expressions, with a nose of fragrant, fruity smoke, hand-rolling tobacco, and new leather. Red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate, while the finish offers gentle peat smoke, cinnamon, and black pepper. £60"
1020,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey Tribute 15 year old, 50.5%<review>A special bottling of Wild Turkey to celebrate Master Distiller Jimmy Russell’s 50 years of being in the bourbon business. Jimmy will be proud to be associated with this bottling. In many ways, this bourbon is a lot like Jimmy: mature, yet with plenty of spunk and character, and a pure joy to be with. This is a big, chewy, full-bodied bourbon with lovely sweet notes (maple syrup, molasses, caramel and candied fruit) balanced by dry spice notes (cigars aged in cedar, evergreen, polished leather). For bourbon drinkers who love intensity in their bourbon.

1021,"<price>283<rating>94<whiskey>Kavalan 10th Anniversary Bordeaux Margaux Wine Cask-Matured Single Malt, 57.8%<review>Beautiful dark amber in color, this has a fabulous nose of lush red-berry fruits, blueberry, red apple, blackcurrant, Fabbri strawberries, peppercorn, wet slate, dry oak, wood spices, and smoked meats. The power of the muscular whisky matches the majesty of the wine cask: berry fruit flavors seep from the thick caramel mouthfeel amid an explosion of pepper at high strength, but with water added this still has incredible range. NT$8,800"
1022,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #18B202), 47.2%<review>There’s evident age here, with dried leaves, old suede jacket, and dusty oak at the forefront, but underlying that maturity is plenty of dried fruit, figs, and cola. It pours broad and mouth filling, exuding both power and grace as it delivers caramel, tobacco, and a mélange of baking spices—cloves and nutmeg. The solid wood structure and oak tannins are here in abundance, but never out of balance."
1023,"<price>165<rating>89<whiskey>Peerless (distilled at Highland Park) 1967, 40.3%<review>Bright gold color. Soft aromas and flavors of delicate honey, heather, subtle spice, tropical fruit, creamy vanilla, and malt. Nicely balanced throughout the palate and very clean-this whisky was aged in an excellent cask. There are no off flavor notes from the wood at all, nor is it too woody on the finish. Rather, it finishes soft, gentle, and clean."
1024,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Hochstadter's Vatted Straight Rye Whiskey (Batch 1), 50%<review>“Vatted” from five 4 to 15 year old straight ryes from Canada, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, and Indiana, in an old-timey bottle. Classic spice-candy-bitter nose leaps out of the glass with 100 proof heat; friendly. Easily drinkable at this proof, well-integrated rye oil and grain sweetness, some cinnamon and dried apple, and the barrel rolls in on the finish. A neatly-wrapped package, and not crazy on the price. Sourced whiskey."
1025,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon Kentucky Straight (2020 Release), 49%<review>
The 20th release of Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, from 95 barrels filled in 2010 and aged 10 years. Light earthiness, dried herbs, and leather on the nose, with notes of black cherry and mint. The palate is surprisingly delicate, but rich with flavors of apple, blackberry, dark chocolate cake, mocha, butterscotch, and aged oak. More earthiness mixes with spice on the finish, followed by buttered pecans, chocolate syrup, caramel, and balanced oak."
1026,"<price>250<rating>94<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve 2002, 57.3%<review>Lovely aromas of warm banana bread with toasted nuts are met with oak and underlying savory notes of garden soil, mushroom, barnyard, and menthol that build layers of complexity. The flavor similarly melds sweet and earthy notes, as Bit-O-Honey and grape candy yield to zesty lemon, drying tobacco leaf, and polished oak tannins. The sweetness, perfectly permeated with earthy complexity, is totally captivating, made complete by a long and satisfying finish laced with spices."
1027,"<price>90<rating>96<whiskey>Jefferson's Presidential Select (Batch #1), 1991 Vintage, 17 year old, 47%<review>A wheated bourbon from the old Stitzel-Weller distillery. A gentle, richly-textured whiskey, loaded with fruit and spice. Black raspberry jam, caramel apple, and papaya, along with warming cinnamon and subtle teaberry, on nutty toffee, nougat, and creamy vanilla. Spicy, polished oak finish. Superbly balanced, sophisticated, and very drinkable. An outstanding whiskey!
"
1028,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Springbank Sherry Wood 17 year old, 52.3%<review>Released in February 2015, this cask strength expression of 17 year old Springbank has been entirely matured in sherry casks. 9,120 bottles are available globally. The nose offers sea spray, blood orange, ginger, and discreet sherry. Finally, some peat. The sherry really makes its presence felt on the palate, which is full and slightly oily, with rich fruitcake flavors, soft toffee, coffee, and ripe cherries. The finish is lengthy, slightly peaty, with more sherry, treacle toffee, and trademark Springbank ozone."
1029,"<price>69<rating>89<whiskey>Ballantine’s 17 year old, 40%<review>Malt biscuits, runny caramel, blended black tea, melting butter sliding across a hot skillet, the leather uppers on new Oxfords, and a more enjoyable waft of peat smoke than expected. Clean, light flavors; lime jelly, root ginger, initially not overly sweet, then a boost of honey, caramelized fruits, with toffee and cocoa later still. It’s pricked with hints of smoke throughout, with a long finish of pepper and other spices. Perfectly enjoyable anytime."
1030,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Forty Creek Three Grain Harmony, 43%<review>Three Grain Harmony marries rye and barley whiskies from 1992-94 to 4 year old corn whisky. The corn lends voluptuous body to a complex assortment of carefully integrated grains, dark fruits, prune juice, and butterscotch. Dried herbs, potpourri, and orange peel follow as the palate begins to broaden. When the big notes fade, look for delicate subtleties. Hot spices and pepper build from sip to sip and linger long into the sandalwood finish."
1031,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>High West Yippee Ki-Yay (Batch #1), 46%<review>High West Double Rye is transferred into vermouth and Syrah barrels, making for an interesting limited release. Herbs, blackberries, black currant, and black pepper are vibrant, followed by a medicinal hint of mint. The vermouth comes alive, with earthy notes meeting the rye’s traditional spices, a welcome back and forth with hints of black fruits. The warm, medium-length finish offers another hint of mint. If you like vermouth, you’ll love this."
1032,"<price>700<rating>82<whiskey>Auchentoshan 32 year old 1973 vintage, 55.5%<review>Whisky from two different sherry casks. The sherry, extra aging, and higher strength produce an intensely rich Auchentoshan. Fudgy caramel, toffee and cocoa notes are offset by golden raisin, apricot, and Clementine. Underlying notes of roasted nuts, old leather, and spice (vanilla, mint) peek through occasionally. An enjoyable whisky, but much of the Auchentoshan is lost somewhere in all that oak and sherry."
1033,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Lonach (distilled at Glenlivet) 34 year old 1971 vintage, 40%<review>Lively on the nose for its age (and on the palate too -- the tell-tale oak emerges only towards the end). Notes of creamy vanilla, barley sugar, coconut, pineapple, and general citrus notes throughout. Dried spices (especially cinnamon) kick in mid-palate and continue into a lengthy, dry, polished oak finish."
1034,"<price>78<rating>84<whiskey>Hart Brothers 11 year old (distilled at Bowmore), 55.5%<review>There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet, but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. An afternoon dram. £50"
1035,"<price>287<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Last Vatted Malt, 53.7%<review>Not Compass Box at the very top of its game, but pretty damn good nevertheless. This is a mix of malts from different distilleries and it has the company's distinctive DNA all over it, combining siege cannon-strength peated malt with rich, fruity, sherried whisky. It's clumsier than the wonderful Flaming Heart but in the same ballpark, and I have to declare an interest — I adore this combination when it's delivered right. £180 "
1036,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig Càirdeas Cask Strength Triple Wood (2019 Release), 59.5%<review>The 2019 edition of Laphroaig’s annual Càirdeas series, this is a cask-strength version of Laphroaig Triple Wood. The complex nose is redolent of iodine, lime, peat smoke, wood-fired meats, drying seaweed, salt air, and other maritime notes. Charred smoky peat and coal fire envelop the palate, and embrace emerging notes of bitter chocolate, licorice, savory herbs, smoked jerky, cracked pepper, and cigar ash. A spicy finish is filled with leather, bitter nuttiness, dark chocolate, espresso, and lingering peat smoke. Number 12 in the 2019 Top 20"
1037,"<price>125<rating>93<whiskey>Exclusive Malts Irish 13 year old (distilled 2003), 54.2%<review>This gorgeous whiskey has taken on a lot of sherry character from the refill sherry hogshead: cherry, prune, chocolate orange, baked pineapple chunks, and toasted spice. A good weighty structure boasting deep citrus intensity, with ginger and pepper snapping at its heels; a sensation only intensified with water. Lush fruits, butterscotch, and milk chocolate, with a finish of lively spices, stone fruits, and zesty orange muffins. (276 bottles)"
1038,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park Cask Strength (Release No. 1), 63.3%<review>
This first cask-strength expression in Highland Park’s core range was matured predominantly in sherry-seasoned American oak. Honey, bonfire smoke, orange peel, and a suggestion of treacle on the nose. Sweet and smoky on the palate, with toffee and orchard fruits turning more citric in time. The finish yields sweet spices, more honey, dark chocolate, black pepper, and bonfire embers. Classic Highland Park—turned up to 11! Editors' Choice"
1039,"<price>1700<rating>73<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Kinclaith), Cask #301446, 35 year old, 1969 vintage, 51.3%<review>This Lowland distillery only operated from 1957-1975. Huge bourbon impact on the nose and palate, along with vanilla, coconut, stewed fruit, and dried wood spice -- especially on the finish, with lingering notes of anise, espresso, very dark chocolate, and charcoal. A taste of history for sure, but this is a whisky that never was meant to be aged this long."
1040,"<price>117<rating>90<whiskey>Adelphi 14 year old 1997 (distilled at Macallan), 51.6%<review>Here is Macallan in full-blown masculine mode. Initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven, but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison, and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. That wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. The palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits, and a finish of molasses and licorice. A feast. £75"
1041,"<price>99<rating>92<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 50.5%<review>An intriguing nose features cherry cough drop and horehound, with hints of mint, crushed herbs, and dried flowers. The palate crackles with candied peanuts, lush spices—pepper and allspice—and oozes with some molten licorice. The oak-driven finish shows exquisite maturity, while keeping the wood in check."
1042,"<price>2000<rating>87<whiskey>The Macallan 1951 Vintage, 48.8%<review>Amber mahogany color. Its 50 years of age are evident in the nose-there's plenty of resinous wood spice notes (especially clove). Also on the nose is citrus (especially orange), a potpourri of dried fruit, light toffee, and a hint of smoked nuts. The body is thick and viscous. The palate expresses flavors similar to its aroma, finishing dry and long."
1043,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Redemption Straight Rye (Batch 259), 46%<review>At first the nose is dominated by wood—pencil shavings and Popsicle sticks—but it soon reveals violets, blueberries, grape Kool-Aid, and peppery spice. The palate is dry, with nuts, herbs and spices, mocha, and semi-sweet chocolate; a few drops of water help with integration and bring out more fruit, including lemon meringue pie. It finishes nutty and dry, with coffee beans and a touch of lemon."
1044,"<price>79<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila 12 year old, 57.6%<review>Unusual, insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try Caol Ila’s other expression: the unpeated version, which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out, the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 
For example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it’s not any old grass, but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it’s whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 
The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. Bizarrely, on the finish, I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram. "
1045,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>A.D. Laws Secale Single Barrel Cask Strength Straight Rye (Barrel #29), 55%<review>Mashbill of 95% rye, 5% malt; both Colorado-sourced. Aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Same grass and spice in the nose as the Straight Rye, but a sweet, almost sherry-like note as well. Flavors are similar—rye grain, bitter oil, alcohol heat—but there’s an added hit of dry cocoa, more heat, and a better, non-sticky finish with a grudging hint of sweetness at the end. Dialed up overall."
1046,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Drambuie 15, 43%<review>Hugely different from the standard Drambuie: much more dryly herbal, and the whisky's right here in the nose...and yet, they are distinctly related in the base character of the herbs. The whisky is quite present — 15 year old Speyside malts shine like the sun on rippling water — but the flavors of Drambuie are clear as well. Still sweet, but the whisky is much more the star. A Drambuie for us?"
1047,"<price>1900<rating>94<whiskey>The Macallan 1824 Limited Release, 48%<review>Antique amber. The darkest and most decadent of the four. Quite viscous and soothing, with well-layered notes of apple pie, marmalade, and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits, ginger, polished leather, tobacco, and resinous oak. One to sip and savor very slowly. (This whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release, the Macallan 55 year old in the Lalique Decanter, and thousands of dollars less.)"
1048,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at North British) 2009 9 year old, 52%<review>Sharp citrus notes, like an unruly spritz of grapefruit juice first thing in the morning. This is an assertive dram with aromas of lemon bonbon, sour fruits, toffee, fruit sodas, and a whiff of potions and unguents wafting from the back room of a pharmacy. It floats between sweet and sour fruits, settling on a sweet lemon mush wedged between some nibbling spices."
1049,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Penderyn Welsh Whisky, 46%<review>This whisky has no age statement, but it is only several years old. It’s also finished off in a Madeira cask. Nicely matured for its age; perhaps, in part, due to its unique copper distillation system. It’s a soft whisky, with layers of creamy sweetness (vanilla, toffee), delicate fruit (coconut, blueberry, black raspberry), and almond, with a little youthful heat on the finish. Already pleasant, this whisky should only need a few more years to reach full maturity. 
"
1050,"<price>70<rating>79<whiskey>Penderyn “Sherrywood,” (06/2008 release), 46%<review>The original Penderyn is finished in Madeira casks. I like the original better (which I rated an 84), as it tastes more mature and the Madeira seems to dovetail better with the other flavors. Fruity (red raspberry, strawberry, banana), with underlying sweet notes (honeyed vanilla, caramel, a hint of butterscotch). Quick, clean finish. Maybe this whisky just needed a little more aging for everything to come together?"
1051,"<price>52<rating>90<whiskey>Spirit of Broadside Eau de Vie de Bier, 43%<review>This contains hops and isn't matured for at least 3 years, so in Europe it can't be classed as whisky, but it's positive proof that some of the experimentation so widespread among American craft distillers is finding its way to Europe. This might be flabby and sappy, but it's sweet and utterly charming, and there is ginger, menthol, and glacé cherry in the mix. But most of all there's tinned pear, and I LOVE tinned pear. Excellently made, too. My new guilty pleasure. £33"
1052,"<price>20<rating>85<whiskey>Grant’s Cask Editions Ale Cask Finish, 40%<review>Buttercream, fresh-cut bread, taffy candy, citrus, and a distinctive hoppy note from the craft ale casks. Charmingly smooth but quite light bodied, there is warmed bramble fruit, bitter grapefruit peel, and plenty of peppery spice. This stands up well to other ale-cask finished whiskies, but in the Grant’s range there are better whiskies with more to offer."
1053,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Penderyn Sherrywood, 46%<review>An implacable tide of sherry aromas, succulent sultana and currant fruit, dried apple, bara brith tea cake, treacle, black tea, and fabulous baking spices: cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. A thick, chewy, malty mouthful with chocolate, Horlicks, coffee notes, and that well-honed Penderyn spice character woven in among the dark fruit. A sweet swan song of clove and peppercorn meets espresso, molasses, dark toffee, and burnt staves. Quite a gem, this one. (600 bottles for U.S.)"
1054,"<price>225<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box This Is Not A Luxury Whisky, 53.1%<review>This surrealist Compass Box whisky mimics the dimensional challenges of Magritte’s “Ceci n’est pas une pipe” by raising questions about the luxury pretensions of whisky. Is it the expense? Packaging? Good taste? Masquerading behind a green apple, a bowler-hatted John Glaser smiles enigmatically. Sultanas, charcoal smoke, toffee, chocolate, sea salt, and warm sherry tones. The alcohol rides with dense black cherry, cacao nibs, Colombian coffee, and dark fruits. Trails of smoking fruitcake finish the experience. Above all, buy and consume. (4,992 bottles)"
1055,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Barrell 4 year old Cask-Strength Blend of Straight Ryes (Batch 003), 58.35%<review>There’s much to discover in the depths of this glass, which continues to develop over time. Dark fruit, tobacco, orange pekoe tea, white pepper, leather, dry-roasted peanuts, and varnish unfold on the nose, while the palate is fruity with blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, and orange; it also has dry oak, nuts, tobacco, and a lot of black pepper spice. The finish is leathery and peppery, with cigar and persistent dark berry flavors. A dense, decadent whiskey that makes it all seem effortless. (12,000 bottles)"
1056,"<price>34<rating>87<whiskey>ScotchMe!, 44.4%<review>And you shall be scotched: vanilla, fudge, eraser-tipped pencils, spoonfuls of thick lemon curd, rhubarb compote, root ginger, and cumin. This malty dram has a decent weight behind it, with rich caramel, chocolate-flavored toffee, deep notes of orange and zested limes, plum fruit, and well-balanced peppery spices. A little spice, dusty chocolate, and Horlicks on the finish. A solid whisky, so just holler if you want some. (1,200 bottles)"
1057,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Balcones FR.OAK Texas (Batch 19-1), 61.9%<review>
Roasted apples, cherry danish, walnuts, dark caramel, and grape jelly on the nose, with more bakery notes emerging after water is added; deep oak is prominent throughout. Tannic and chewy on the palate, which leans more bitter than sweet, with coffee beans and baking chocolate underscored by a savory ashy character. Water pulls out more dark fruit and takes the finish from rough to rounded."
1058,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Vintage Rye, 21 year old, 47%<review>Very much in the same vein as the Rittenhouse Rye, with just a bit more oak, spicy, heat, and some leather on the finish.

1059,"<price>325<rating>89<whiskey>Blackadder 31 year old 1988 (Distilled at Cambus), 46.1%<review>

This spirit was laid down five years before the distillery closed and has a classic grain whisky nose of green herbs and spice, with notes of aromatic woods, tarragon, dune grasses, and plain popcorn. The mouthfeel is smooth, with evident strength, and flavors of honey, corn flakes, vanilla, granola bars, dried banana, golden syrup, crunchy oak cookies, sultana, and sesame oil, with a hot, dry, and slightly nutty finish. (232 bottles, 60 for U.S.)"
1060,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>Bushmills The Steamship Collection Rum Cask Reserve, 40%<review>Jaffa orange, flowers, hard candies, rose water, and light spices make a rather muted offering. Fortunately there’s a sweet, malty mouthful of fudge, orange shred, gingerbread, and candied orange slices, with a nibble of peppercorn spices and a finish of clove-studded orange. Tasty and well-balanced, salvaging the less than inspiring nose. (Travel Retail)"
1061,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Duncansby Head, 46%<review>Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins. The palate is smooth and chewy, with sherry making its presence felt along with cooked apples, oranges, sultanas, nutmeg, and cocoa. The finish is spicy and nicely rounded. £45/liter"
1062,"<price>52<rating>90<whiskey>Old Beezer (Batch No. 1) 10 year old, 45%<review>From Kentucky, the journey begins with generous at-the-fair candy corn and subtle hints of vanilla, caramel, and smoke. I find the caramelized grains and spice just as appealing. While the hint of maple syrup is nice, this is simple goodness with every taste. Sourced whiskey."
1063,"<price>4000<rating>91<whiskey>The Last Drop 1965 Blend 48 year old, 48.6%<review>Originally blended, then recasked into fresh bourbon wood three decades ago, the nose of ripened peaches, cooked pear, pecan nuts, menthol, clove, and vanilla make for a compelling combination. A surprising lift of red summer fruits as this bright whisky sashays around the mouth, the complexity measured out in installments; plum sauce, toasted oak, coffee bean, gingersnaps, clove, licorice, and hints of savory juices. It dances on and on with the whirling wood spices in no hurry whatsoever. (592 bottles)"
1064,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Penelope Barrel Strength Four Grain Straight Bourbon (Batch 4), 58.3%<review>The nose offers cherry, raspberry tart, dried orange slices, butterscotch, black pepper, and antique closet. The palate is powerful, with sweet syrup up front, bold flavors of herbs and spice, grain, dusty oak, and an earthy note of warehouse floor. More spice emerges with water, bringing semi-sweet chocolate, cooked raspberries, and leather. Creamy and well-balanced, with its spice tempered by deep chocolate, cooked cherries, and a musty yet interesting character."
1065,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Tom’s Town Double Oaked Bourbon, 45%<review>A nose of dark fruit, figs, sassafras, powdered orange candy, and brown sugar leads to a palate that’s lightly nimble, with vanilla, iced tea, lemon, cracked pepper, and textured oak. Water brings out sweeter notes, with orange and strawberry balanced against herbal flavors and eucalyptus. The finish is sweet and a bit light, tasting of sliced orange, vanilla syrup, toasted oak, and roasted herbs. A balanced, light, and somewhat non-traditional bourbon."
1066,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Penderyn Portwood Batch 2, 41%<review>Penderyn will miss distiller Gillian MacDonald, who has gone to work at Glenmorangie, because it has been moving up the gears of late. This is a traveling circus of a whisky, with all sorts of oral treats to keep you entertained. It's not for the faint-hearted. There are rich stewed fruits, baked apple, blueberries, and spirit-soaked black and red berries all delivered with a power punch. Great. £30"
1067,"<price>25<rating>90<whiskey>Larceny, 46%<review>Lots of dried fruit, figs, and caramel lead off this bold but balanced bourbon, as dark berry fruits smack of sweet crème de cassis on the palate. There’s a good bit of spice here, like hot and spicy peanuts, that meets the sweet fruit and vanilla. Shows great length and nice polish on the finish with its dusty oak and cocoa."
1068,"<price>81<rating>87<whiskey>Mackmyra Midvinter, 46.1%<review>This wintery limited edition was finished in casks that previously held Bordeaux, Glühwein, and sherry. This achieves an appealing nose of orchard fruits and spices. Juicy apple, hints of conference pear, cinnamon, clove, vanilla tablet, and lemon pith. Apple is at the core of the flavor, but it’s rich with warming spices, strawberry, and zabaglione, tightening in the end to a conclusion of dried fruits, nut shells, and a twist of pepper. (Sweden, France, and Germany only) €65"
1069,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky #1 35 year old (batch 3), 46.5%<review>This dark, chestnut liquid exudes wafts of rose hip, dense fruitcake, sliced fig, cherry, oak, Brazil nut, and earthy, fragrant damp moss within the rich sherry complexity. A voluptuous, palate-saturating whisky, with burnt orange, ginger spices, star anise, dried fig, and ripe purple plums, concluding with chocolate truffles. It’s a rollicking good blend, dripping with sherry notes, and leaves a deep glow far back in the palate. You’re going to love it. (1,428 bottles) £120"
1070,"<price>325<rating>89<whiskey>Telsington Black Edition 5 year old, 43.5%<review>The historic Telser distillery has been producing spirits for generations. Their pride and joy: a triple distilled whisky produced in two wood-fired stills before being matured wholly in French oak barriques that previously contained Pinot Noir. There are overripe melons, powdery icing sugar, and an unobtrusive jamminess on the nose. The flavorsome palate hits you with bright yellow fruits, then twists brilliantly to divulge deep orange and peeled plum skin balanced with gingerbread (available in Lichtenstein, Germany, Switzerland, and online) CHF 290"
1071,"<price>47<rating>87<whiskey>Lohin McKinnon Wine Barrel Finished, 43%<review>Single malt whisky from British Columbia-grown and malted barley, matured in bourbon barrels, then finished in wine barrels from Black Sage Vineyard in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley. Malted barley leaps from the glass along with a vague earthiness and mild fruits. Malty cereal on the palate, with vanilla, hot spices, milk chocolate, and purple grapes. The port-style wine influence is tastefully subtle. Finishes on dark fruits and milk chocolate. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
1072,"<price>85<rating>86<whiskey>Hakushu 12 year old, 43.5%<review>Although only two years older, this expression of Hakushu — the first to be launched in the U.S. — shows a fleshier side to the distillery’s wares. While it has retained the freshness of the 10 year old, it shows more pineapple and grapefruit on the nose, with a little fragrance of jasmine and osmanthus. On the palate, it’s fresh and lively with a hint of persimmon and a tickle of smoke. Recommended."
1073,"<price>225<rating>92<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Cameronbridge) 1984 33 year old, 51.2%<review>Top notes of hay, honey, and caramel over a spicy core pulsating with pepper, rye, spiced Quaker Oats, and freshly planed wood. An epic battle ensues: round after round of citrus vs. spice, both growing stronger as they slug it out; jabs of sweetness meet a chastisingly nippy right hook, until, eventually exhausted, both protagonists drop their guard. Dry crackling spice and sugared almonds run through a mighty long finish."
1074,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Chivas Regal Mizunara Cask, 40%<review>This whisky is slowly making its way around the world, but it was worth the wait, as master blender Colin Scott’s use of mizunara oak makes for an impressively different nose from Chivas Regal 12 year old. Pecans, sandalwood, coriander seed, honeycomb, peanuts, and rich oak aromas herald a warming dram with fabulously developed orange zest and vanilla toffee flavors, before a more assertive finish of dark toffee and tenacious spices."
1075,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Cask-Strength Connoisseurs Choice 2005 (Distilled at Glenturret; Cask No. 1760), 52.8%<review>Freshly polished oak, walnuts, damsons, vanilla, and orange blossom are present on the nose. The slightly oily and peppery palate features sweet sherry, more vanilla, nutmeg, then black currants and raisins. Prunes, drying oak, and black coffee in the medium-length finish. A very solid Highlander for lovers of sherry cask maturation. (298 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
1076,"<price>35<rating>81<whiskey>Fitch’s Goat 100% Corn Whiskey, 48.5%<review>Sweet and a bit funky; maybe a wisp of smoke, maybe some green cornstalk, and some mint/vanilla. Rippling and vibrant in the mouth, hot and bold, and not candy-sweet at all, more like fuel-injected cornbread with a splash of burning mint eau de vie across the top. Or maybe that’s just the AC/DC talking; maybe I should review to Mozart. Not bad, but I think I like the simpler unaged version."
1077,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Old Pulteney 15 year old, 46%<review>This expression replaces the previous 17 year old, and has been aged in bourbon and second-fill American oak casks, followed by a period in first-fill Spanish oak oloroso butts. Sherry is immediately obvious on the nose, with fresh-baked fruitcake aromas, honey, and allspice. The palate is sweet and spicy, with Jaffa orange segments dipped in sea salt, toffee, and dark chocolate. Orange and oak in the medium-length finish."
1078,"<price>262<rating>90<whiskey>Mars Tsunuki The First, 59%<review>
Aromas of ripe peach, barley, dry spices, waxy green leaves, baked citrus, scorched earth, and dried flowers on Hombo Shuzo’s debut whisky from Mars Tsunuki Distillery, produced in the 2016–2017 season. Sipping reveals sweet orange, chocolate, and clove, though the spices are straining at the leash and the high-strength alcohol can KO unwary taste buds. Dilute and the fruits shine beautifully while the spices are kept in check. (9,984 bottles)"
1079,"<price>77<rating>89<whiskey>The Whistler 7 year old Natural Cask Strength, 59%<review>This dials up the aromas so high it could freshen up a stadium. After a riot of bright fruits, paradise slice, nutmeg, cinnamon, dates, and raisin, the palate becomes awash with apple and rose hip, though the strength makes it a wild ride, the tongue is conquered into submission. Diluted, it shines with vanilla sponge cake, plum, malt, and spicy nutmeg. Beautiful whiskey, just needs to be pegged back a bit. €65"
1080,"<price>78<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice 1999 (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory), 46%<review>This peated expression from Tobermory distillery has been aged in refill, remade hogsheads. The nose offers earthy peat, citrus fruit, vanilla, and smoked haddock in butter. Big, sweet peat notes on the peppery palate, with marshmallows and lively spices. The spices linger to the close, with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60"
1081,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Bowmore 18 year old, 43%<review>This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only.) The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish.

1082,"<price>88<rating>89<whiskey>Puni Gold, 43%<review>A fruity tour de force matured for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this revels in aromas of vanilla sponge cake, honey, summer fruits in syrup, fresh cream, apricot, nectarine, apple, and green mango. Very approachable on the palate, with vanilla cream, thick custard, citrus, lime, lemon zest, baked apricot, peppercorn, green melon, apple, and candied peel. The spices drop out, leaving fruit flan, orange honey, and a gooseberry sharpness on the finish."
1083,"<price>15<rating>77<whiskey>Southern Shine Original Moonshine, 40%<review>Although this moonshine may look down-home in a mason jar, it was produced using the highly technical TerrePure process, designed to remove most congeners. The result is a corn neutral spirit that doesn’t smell or taste much like corn. Instead, it’s soft vanilla, toasted marshmallow, and a dash of salt. A little heat and white pepper round things out for a long, peppery-dry finish. It’s pretty good for a vodka, but is it really moonshine or white whiskey? Probably not."
1084,"<price>240<rating>88<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glen Moray) 22 year old, 55%<review>Gold in color and sweet on the nose, with a little nudge of mash, stewed apples, and cobnuts. As it develops, the impression is of a polite garden tea at the minister’s: vanilla sponge, scones with cream and strawberry jam, with a background of lightly-turned earth. The palate continues equally sweetly and is lightly hot when neat. A glimpse of summer pleasures in wintertime."
1085,"<price>185<rating>93<whiskey>Ballantine’s 23 year old, 40%<review>An exceptional blend from first-fill American oak casks, which has Glenburgie
whisky at its heart. Dry oak, Rolos, cantaloupe, dried mango strips, papaya, and
cinnamon on the nose. Rewarding and weighty, with caramel, orange, raspberry,
layers of spice, and dark toffee, with a concentrated fruitiness and a smear of spices
leading to a warm, dark, lengthy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)

1086,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Nomad Outland Whisky, 41.3%<review>A 5 to 8 year old blended scotch married for 3 years in sherry casks in Scotland and finished for 12 months in Pedro Ximenez casks in Jerez. The nose has luscious figs, raisins, molasses, and berries, brightened with apricot-tangerine notes when water is added. The palate is intense: Fig Newtons, dark chocolate, raisins, and orange peel, finishing with honey, Raisinets, and chocolate-covered nuts—a soft, slightly under-proofed conclusion, but still satisfying."
1087,"<price>35<rating>91<whiskey>Elijah Craig Small Batch Single Barrel Bourbon 10 year old, 47%<review>Subtly complex and nicely rounded. A bed of sweetness (caramel, vanilla) peppered with honey-kissed fruit, golden raisin, and a hint of marzipan. Pleasing oak grip and dried spice on the finish. A great value for such a high-quality bourbon. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
1088,"<price>183<rating>84<whiskey>Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Tormore) 1988, 55.6%<review>Full gold. Good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft. It begins to firm up, but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125"
1089,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>A.P. Hotaling J.H. Cutter, 48%<review>Expressively aromatic, with orange, chai spices, incense, spearmint, and Juicy Fruit gum, buttressed by earthy moss and cedar. Equally vivid flavors of dry oak, pepper, cinnamon Red Hots, dried orange peel, orange pekoe tea, and chili-chocolate, but it loses steam on the finish. Water tames some of the brasher qualities without dampening the liveliness."
1090,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Rough Rider Bull Moose Rye, 45%<review>Sourced whiskey, moved to used bourbon barrels, then finished in barrels that held their Pine Barrens whiskey (also reviewed this issue). Pine sap, sweet juicy berries, and oak aromas; had to re-nose to be sure on that pine. Mouth is relatively smooth, much more so than the Rough Rider bourbon. Picking up some of that Pine Barren fudge, and a touch of rye grassiness. Finish is warm and spicy. A nice young rye."
1091,"<price>22<rating>88<whiskey>Gibson’s Finest Bold 8 year old, 46%<review>With NAS, 12, and 18 year old versions long-established as Canadian favorites, Gibson’s master blender, Brian Kinsman (of Glenfiddich), turned his hand to an 8 year old specifically intended to be mixed with Coke. Why? That’s how 40% of Canadians prefer their whisky. Rich in dark rum notes, kola nuts, vanilla pods, and sweet rye, it bursts with ripe black fruits and sizzling hot spices. Sip slowly to uncover black licorice, a touch of tannin, and the classic Canadian hot, bitter pith finish. C$29"
1092,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Abraham Bowman High Rye Bourbon, 50%<review>“Contains five times more rye than A. Smith Bowman’s standard bourbon recipe,” aged 7 years and 9 months. A lean bourbon nose: sweet grain, leather, pepper, oak. Zing in the mouth! Quite spicy, with a smooth, oily feel, notes of dried apple and split fruit-tree branches, and a driving but welcome heat that lines straight through to the long, dry finish. Bold, interesting, and worthy of repeating! Limited release; mainly in Virginia."
1093,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Ice Cask, 41.5%<review>Wayne Gretzky’s distillery makes serious whisky. A large, copper Vendome column and a Heriot-Watt graduate distiller make for some pretty fine spirit that will eventually fill Gretzky bottles. Sourced for now, this rich, round, and creamy whisky is finished in ice wine casks from Gretzky’s vineyards. Cinnamon-tinged ripe red apples and kiwifruit in sultana syrup, with baking spices and hot white pepper fading into mild barrel notes."
1094,"<price>68<rating>93<whiskey>Millstone Rye 100, 50%<review>From the distillery that received last year’s World Whisky award comes another contender for the title in 2013. This is called 100 because it’s 100 percent rye distilled in pot stills, 100 proof, and 100 months old (a bit over eight years). It’s big, and perfectly balanced between honey and fruit, sparkling distinctive raunchy spice, and a dash of ginger biscuits. This is rye to die for. Superb. €53"
1095,"<price>198<rating>92<whiskey>Cladach, 57.1%<review>Sun-bleached driftwood, iodine, curry spices, and hot asphalt, with a highly charged, aromatic smokiness: a combination of peat kiln and crackling moorland blaze. There is serenity too, with soft cream, ripe citrus, and key lime pie. Thick and glossy, it’s an intense, mouth-puckering, cask-strength prospect. Chocolate, cinnamon, and mint collide with a barrage of clove and barrel char. Booming spices reverberate in the grip of an extremely long finish. £155"
1096,"<price>168<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bowmore) 18 year old, 60.1%<review>The first thing to note is the strength. It’s surprisingly not that hot initially, rather there are hints of soft orchard fruits, gentle smoke, and seashells. With water, the fruits show up—mango and peach—but the alcohol is still masking things. Water goes in immediately to produce a palate that is cool, slightly sweet, with seashore notes, wet stones, and those fruits, but there’s still a real tension to the whole experience. For the brave. £110"
1097,"<price>99<rating>96<whiskey>William Larue Weller 12 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 62.85%<review>Tilled earth, tobacco, and leather meet clover honey, maple syrup, and pecan pie sweetness. It pours broad and mouth-coating across the palate, with a lovely softness and pervasive vanilla and apple sweetness, gently tugged at by oaky tannins and more tobacco leaf. A touch floral and gently spiced, with cinnamon leading the way. Overall, this exudes beautiful balance right through the long finish that resonates both prettily and powerfully with dried citrus. Collectible"
1098,"<price>89<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Springbank Batch 2, 53.10%<review>That Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. The whiskies carry no age statements. Springbank Batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. Initially, overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose, cut by a sprinkling of salt. Brittle toffee, and finally, hand-rolling tobacco. The palate is very fruity; more pineapple, plus peach, developing peat, plenty of spice, and more tobacco. The finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58"
1099,"<price>820<rating>79<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1974, 50.1%<review>A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The nose immediately betrays the fact that this has been matured in a first-fill sherry hogshead. It’s akin to an artisan’s workshop, all leather oil and strange resins. There’s an intriguing hint of curry spices and truffle, but all in all this is about density, black fruits (damson), allspice, and clove. The cask is in charge. The palate has more tannin than you perhaps want — powerful and grippy with lots of nut and tea-like tannins; too grippy for me. £500"
1100,"<price>138<rating>78<whiskey>Yamazakura 16 year old, 40%<review>Age statements are disappearing from Japanese whiskies, but this 80% grain content blended whisky from Sasanokawa Shuzo is evidence that age is no substitute for flavor. A tight nose of lychee, white pepper, allspice, and toasted oats is bettered by a sweet, light profile, yielding American oak characteristics of vanilla and creamed coconut. It’s quickly dominated by intensely spicy seasoning overcoming late notes of burnt orange, fresh fig, and sour grapefruit peel before a finish of peppered mackerel. (1,992 bottles, Europe only) €130"
1101,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Old Elk Straight Rye, 50%<review>Sweet caramel, grainy Cheerios, root beer spices, and waxy crayon make for a captivating nose. The dark fruit and spice suggest toasted raisin bread, and diving deeper into the flavor reveals sweet black cherry, citrus zest, and intriguing notes of licorice and hot asphalt, with flickers of horehound and cough drop. The fruit, spice, and earthy notes are nicely woven together and soar seamlessly through the finish."
1102,"<price>109<rating>87<whiskey>Bakery Hill Cask Strength Single Malt, 60%<review>While much of the interest in Australian whisky has focused on Tasmania, there are mainland distilleries, such as The Great Southern Distilling Company and this one, which have been making a major contribution to the country’s growing whisky reputation. In fact, David Baker’s malt is as good as anything in Australasia. This is a Scotch-style single malt, all clean fresh green fruit, particularly apples, and some orange. The taste is zingy, with almonds and sweet chocolate-covered digestive biscuits. Delicious. AUD105 (Not available in the U.S.)"
1103,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>The most underrated of the five in the 2011 collection, but this year’s release (like last year’s) is very lovely bourbon. Perhaps just a bit softer than last year, but with a similar profile: very even keeled and nicely balanced, with sweet notes (vanilla, toffee, añejo rum) peppered with soft orchard fruit and spice (cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg, hint of mint), polished oak, and subtle tobacco. "
1104,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Arran The Bothy Quarter Cask, 55.7%<review>A limited edition of 12,000 bottles, this expression from Arran was initially matured in first-fill bourbon barrels before a secondary period of aging in American oak quarter casks, which accelerated maturation. A big hit of tinned peaches, then malt, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet and rounded on the palate, with lots of fresh fruit, notably pineapple, plus caramel, chili, and ginger. Relatively long in the fruity finish, with brittle toffee, new oak, and persistent spice. £55"
1105,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Middle West Spirits Double Cask Collection OYO Oloroso Wheat (Batch 2), 51%<review>Lavish red fruit and sherry blanket this whiskey, initially aged in American oak barrels followed by 12-18 months in oloroso sherry casks, to approach 5 years age in total. It may be the light toast of the initial barrels that allows this wheat whiskey to stand up exceptionally well, developing seamless flavors of figgy pudding, walnuts, chocolate-covered raisins, cacao nibs, and maple candy, culminating in a finish that nicely balances fruit and leathery oak. Carries its proof nicely."
1106,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated 12 year old, 46%<review>Runny caramel, green melon, and vanilla, tagged with a few savory and spice notes, though the smoke shows greater peat characteristics than the 21 year old. The tongue dips into honey, fudge, and caramel, duels with mouth-drawing fruits such as raspberry, redcurrant, and cranberry, then settles back under a gentle blanket of spice. A late flash of fresh mint departs with some spicy heat at the finish."
1107,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey> The Whistler Imperial Stout Cask-Finished, 43%<review>
This is so delicious that it makes you want to slip into the glass and join it. Coffee bean, orange peel, and fruit-forward dark chocolate bars, then chocolate ganache, cocoa powder, black cherry, and peppercorn. Wheat whiskey makes up 50% of the blend, and it tastes of chocolate orange and milky coffee, with a crashing wave of pepper and ginger spices. Vibrant dark fruits persist with a creamy chocolate finish. (3,000 bottles for U.S.)"
1108,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Hakushu Heavily Peated, 48%<review>Last year saw the release of the Yamazaki “component” range, examples of the cask types that help make up its single malt releases. Now, Hakushu has joined in. The name doesn’t lie, this is very smoky, heathery, fragrant with orris-like dryness alongside Hakushu’s classic vegetal notes of elderflower, bamboo, and moorland grass. The palate shows praline, ripe lychee, and kiwi working alongside this mix of integrated smoke and clean focus. It also makes a fantastic Hiball."
1109,"<price>53<rating>92<whiskey>Fuji-Sanroku 50° 50%<review>Jota Tanaka, Kirin’s chief blender, utilizes all the versatility of the complex production at Fuji Gotemba Distillery to create this truly superb non-chill filtered whisky. The dark vanilla, toffee brittle, macadamia nuts, heady incense, and singed oak have instant appeal. Sweet popcorn smothered in milk chocolate rotates through cherry, damson, and red apple, settling on a palate of toffee apple spiked with pepper and licorice. Tingling spices on a drying finish. £41"
1110,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Port Charlotte 10 Second Limited Edition, 50%<review>This was matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, French wine, and tempranillo casks. Initial brine on the nose gives way to malt and orchard fruits, sweet smoke, and buttery malt. Sweet, medicinal smoke notes on the early palate, then toffee and peaches drying to aniseed and chili. Long and prickly in the finish, with licorice and black pepper. A complex rendering of Port Charlotte."
1111,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>White Oak Akashi Japanese Single Malt, 46%<review>A winsome, floral nose, with icing sugar, green tea, sweet toffee, and juicy fruits including apricot, dragon fruit, and ripe watermelon. The honey-fruity core of tangerine, watermelon, orange oils, Starburst candies, and a little caramel imports attractive flavors, the balance and complexity given heft by the white pepper and dried chili notes. The drawback is the lack of body and texture. The end brings a flurry of pepper and burnt oak, and a long tail of melon and spices."
1112,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Glendronach 12 year old, 40%<review>Over the past decade there has been no shortage of Glendronach expressions. I know of at least one 15 year old, an 18 year old, a 19 year old, a 1968 vintage, and four different 12 year old versions. My favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the U.S. about a decade ago. The 1968 Vintage, which you can still find on retailers’ shelves, is also a worthy dram. But this new 12 year old “Original” expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). I feel that Glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry, allowing a greater balance of flavors. This whisky was originally matured in sherry casks, but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. The result? A richly flavored, nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit, burnt caramel, light toffee, and nuts, all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. Yum!

It starts slightly sweet, finishing pleasantly dry and subtly spicy. 
"
1114,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Talisker 18 year old, 45.8%<review>A sophisticated and refined Talisker, if that’s not an oxymoron. But this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. This 18 year old is deeper too, with less of the fishnets, more of oak boat docks. Less lemongrass, more fruit gum drops. There’s still that knock-out punch on the finish. There’s a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. This whisky has not crossed that line. A fabulous whisky! 
"
1115,"<price>16<rating>80<whiskey>George Dickel Cascade Hollow, 40%<review>Youthful, simple, and uncomplicated. Buttered corn, soft vanilla, honey, and bright fruit, with a kiss of spice. Fairly quick finish."
1116,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Journeyman Distillery Last Feather, 45%<review>
An enigmatic and quiet whiskey, whose subtle complexity begs for your attention. The nose is minty and fresh with pine, balanced by earthy clay, matcha, green almonds, milk chocolate, and spice. Dry and a bit earthy on the palate, which has texture without heaviness; mint, walnuts, dark fruit, cola, root beer, and black pepper create a savory-sweet effect, leading into the well-paced finish."
1117,"<price>125<rating>91<whiskey>Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye, 53.7%<review>Peerless Distilling’s first whiskey in nearly a century; at 2 years old, it’s precocious. Captivating on the nose; fruit-driven, with orange, peach nectar melded with vanilla custard, and nice details of clove and nutmeg. The palate pours big and bold, bursting with fruit alcohol and a face slap of spicy, peppery rye. While it’s a touch hot, the reveal of 53.7% makes this forgivable. A generous splash of water unleashes more flavor, baking spice, and aniseed on the finish."
1118,"<price>76<rating>92<whiskey>Bowmore 15 year old, 43%<review>Formerly known as Darkest, this expression was given a secondary maturation for 3 years in oloroso sherry casks. The nose features smoky caramel, dates, citrus fruits, and quite dry sherry. Dark chocolate and cocktail cherries on the rich malty palate, with peat smoke and a hint of dry oak balancing the sweet fruitiness. Sherry, brine, soft peat, oak, and allspice in the lingering finish."
1119,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Black Bull, 12 year old, 50%<review>Quite rich and chewy, with nutty toffee, vanilla fudge, nougat, chocolate cake, orchard fruit, and black cherry—all on a solid malty foundation. This isn’t one of those elegant, lighter-flavored blends with a high grain whisky content. The focus here is on fullness of flavor. A blend for the malt whisky drinker (but should also appeal to the more open-minded blend drinker, too)."
1120,"<price>95<rating>93<whiskey>GlenDronach 15 year old, 46%<review>Deeper, richer, more viscous, and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing, with raisin, orange marmalade, grape skin, sugar plum, cinnamon bun, raspberry preserve, mixed nuts, and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch, and very impressive!"
1121,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Select Cask Rye Cask Finish, 46%<review>A zeitgeist Johnnie Walker fine-tuned for the American palate, this blend has a moreish nose of cinnamon, cocoa, and the toasted coconut of macaroons, mingled with strands of smoke, dried walnut, nutmeg, and an array of spicy rye anchored by a concentrated line of vanilla. Lots of American oak at play here. It’s elegant, dry, and smooth with vanilla, cinnamon, coconut, and flashes of spice. It’s fabulous sipped straight up but keep walking to the finish. Value Pick."
1122,"<price>675<rating>91<whiskey>Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1993, 43%<review>The third release in Glenmorangie’s Bond House No.1 Collection spent 10 years in bourbon casks before being transferred into Bual madeira casks for 15 years of secondary maturation. Spicy nougat and ginger on the nose, stewed apricots, and a hint of bonfire smoke. Viscous on the palate, juicy, with strawberry liqueur chocolates. Spices linger long in the finish, with damsons and dark chocolate. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
1123,"<price>24000<rating>91<whiskey>The Dalmore 1969 42 year old, 45.5%<review>Initially filled into an ex-bourbon cask, then transferred into a Gonzales Byass oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry butt in 2005 for four years, before a final two years in a freshly-emptied bourbon barrel. The nose is initially floral, with overripe Seville oranges, figs, ginger, and cocoa powder. Peaches and almonds on the palate, before dark fruits and salted nuts appear. Drying oak is held at bay, and the final note is fat and figgy. Cask number 14; 233 bottles."
1124,"<price>21<rating>83<whiskey>Throttle2Bottle, 40%<review>Sweeter on the nose than the palate, with crème caramel, autumn fruits, and sweet rye spices. Initial caramel notes become peppery, with raging heat that glows in the throat. A creamy mouthfeel works hard to resist this incursion of hot rye spices and searing cayenne pepper. Feels hotter than 40%, with sizzling spices but no alcohol burn. Fruity notes come and go, centered on cooked apples. Eventually fades to a long, sourish, bitter-orange finish."
1125,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, 1995 Vintage, “French Oak Barrel Aged,” 45% <review>Dark, big, and brooding. A mouthful of oak spice, resin, and leather. Surprisingly (and happily) the oak is never excessive — even on the finish. A mélange of toffee, maple syrup, and candy corn props it all up. The flavors aren’t as well defined as its sibling release (reviewed above), and there’s a peculiar hint of “dunnage warehouse” (think damp earth) to it that adds intrigue. A very characterful whiskey worthy of debate. Price is per 375ml."
1126,"<price>120<rating>87<whiskey>John MacDougall's Selection (distilled at Bladnoch), 16 year old, 55.8%,<review>Bright gold color, and bright in flavor. Very much in the Bladnoch style, with honey-kissed lemon, tangerine, kiwi, creamy vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, marzipan, cut grass, and hay. Richly textured for a Lowland, and palate-coating (a tad oily, too!). The extra years have added some depth, while still retaining a youthful zest. Very enjoyable.

1127,"<price>53<rating>90<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1987, 43%<review>Amber gold color. Rich aromas of complex fruit and vanilla. Thick and rich in body, with a mouth-coating texture. Flavors of honeyed malt, well structured fruit, and vanilla, with a long finish.

1128,"<price>85<rating>84<whiskey>Bushmills Sherry Cask Reserve, 40%<review>This first release in the Steamship Collection was matured in oloroso sherry butts and enticingly smells both oily and jammy. Dried fruits, such as cranberry, cherry, and raisin, with Brazil nut oil, wood spice, and light pepper. A soft dram, tasting of stewed apple, plum, cherry jelly, spiced orange, dark chocolate, and ending with spices, pepper, fading fruit, and carob nibs. It’s not all at sea, but just needs more body, especially mid-palate, to ride the waves of oloroso influence. (Travel Retail exclusive) £65"
1129,"<price>230<rating>86<whiskey>St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Triple Distilled Cask 0116, 60.8%<review>The Private Cellar range is a cask strength, single cask range where St. George's can have some fun and dip a toe into uncharted waters. Triple distillation makes the whisky smoother, sweeter, and more rounded…which shouldn't work with the earthy, rustic style of St. George’s. It does —big time. There are rum and raisin notes, and a creaminess that masks the sappy youthfulness of the whisky (it's 5 years old).   £148"
1130,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Tomintoul With A Peaty Tang, 40%<review>First released in 2008, Peaty Tang is a blend of 4 to 5 year old heavily peated and 8 year old unpeated whiskies. Pipe tobacco on the nose, with damp undergrowth, canned pears, and smoked meat. Medium-bodied, with light sweet peat smoke, vanilla, cereal, green apples, and licorice on the palate. Dark chocolate, caramel, and tangy smoke in the short to medium finish."
1131,"<price>79<rating>88<whiskey>Longrow Red, 52.1%<review>This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50"
1132,"<price>12<rating>75<whiskey>McAfee’s Benchmark Old No. 8, 40%<review>Freshly cut oak and chewing tobacco to start, followed by hints of green apple, wood chips, and a warm, wet sharpening stone. On the palate, the wood heightens and becomes extremely bitter. This whiskey’s saving grace is that it’s extremely palatable in cocktails."
1133,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Rye (Barrel #17A34), 46.4%<review>On the nose, a tapestry of candied fruit, dark caramel, and molasses. Then it’s herbs, ocean air, oak, fruit, roasted peanuts, pecan pie, and pie crust in the oven. Nuanced vanilla appears, but prominent black licorice, leather, burnt pumpkin bread, and tobacco dominate toward the end. A decently long finish gives a strong hint of bread pudding. This is definitely not your typical rye, but it sure is tasty."
1134,"<price>109<rating>94<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Ruby Port Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Batch No. AH10), 60.26%<review>Brownie batter, toasted almonds, maple syrup, orange peel, ginger, raspberries, and
strawberries on the nose, with a touch of iced tea. The palate is oily and rich with
fruit, especially after water is added; orange marmalade and cherry soda mingle with
semi-sweet chocolate and chicory coffee. Chicory, mocha, polished oak, and cocoa
powder on the finish. Add water for more prominent fruit notes without losing the
rich character or stellar balance.
"
1135,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Crown Royal Cornerstone Blend, 40.3%<review>Inspired by Crown Royal Monarch, Crown Royal is introducing a new line of equally remarkable whiskies called the Noble Collection. This “Cornerstone Blend” begins the series. Rye-grain whisky, fresh-cut lumber, and new oak. Sweet, with a broad spiciness, rich heady nose, floral overtones, and fruity esters. Vague milk chocolate, tropical fruit, and ripe bananas soften the peppery spices. Powerful yet elegant. Complex and tightly synthesized into a single, well balanced whole."
1136,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Scotch Malt Whisky Society (50:42) 18 year old, 56.9%<review>Distilled in Scotland’s most southerly distillery of Bladnoch in October 1992, this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead, and 150 bottles have been allocated to the U.S. It presents a fresh nose, with initial herbal notes, turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively short, with spicy custard, then a final fruit flourish. "
1137,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old, 43%<review>This ever-popular expression of Balvenie is matured for roughly 12 years in ex-bourbon casks and finished for 9 months in Spanish oak oloroso sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey, oak, and almonds. Spicy sherry, nutmeg, and dried fruit on the silky palate. Quite long in the finish, with a hint of orange, plus drying spices. Elegant, yet robust."
1138,"<price>47<rating>78<whiskey>Penderyn Legend, 41%<review>This edition was matured in bourbon but finished in Madeira casks, which lends it a honeyed, sweet nose of cream soda, lychee, whole almond, and dried tropical fruit. Smartly, the finishing cask gives a lift but never dominates. A fresh, clean taste, but the mouthfeel has a frailty, so although you will find lemon, icing sugar, candy bananas, and molten honey, this doesn’t quite live up to its rousing name. £31"
1139,"<price>17<rating>84<whiskey>Trader Joe’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>The nose is innocuous, with some cinnamon, herbal iced tea, sweet oranges, cedar, and dry oak. Sweet and wood-forward on the palate, it is also drying and hot, with herbal tea, orange oil, chocolate, cinnamon, and cherry cough syrup. While there are flavors to enjoy here, they seem to need more time to fully develop. (Trader Joe’s)"
1140,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>High West A Midwinter Nights Dram (Act 7, Scene 6), 49.3%<review>A finish in port casks imparts plenty of dark fruit and rich flavor throughout this blend of ryes, which includes some of High West’s own make. The nose is leathery, with plums, cherries, dark chocolate, brown sugar, orange pekoe tea, and blueberry jam. More fruit on the palate, including black cherry, orange marmalade, and raisin, as well as cacao nibs, baking spice, cola, and rich oak. The finish is lengthy and layered, with cough syrup, dark berries, chocolate, and cola."
1141,"<price>512<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glen Grant), 1966, 41 year old, 49.4%<review>There have been a lot of old, heavily sherried, independently bottled Glen Grant whiskies on the market over the past several years. This one appears to be from a refill sherry cask, as its influence is more subtle. It has aged well, showing no excessive oak, but plenty of fruit (summer fruits, dried citrus, stewed fruits, tangerine, golden raisin), balanced by polished oak, grape skin, and subtle dark chocolate. Distinctively pleasing. Don’t add too much water, though, as it breaks down. (A Kensington Wine Market exclusive.) $500 (CAD)"
1142,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Armorik Double Maturation, 46%<review>France has quietly been making some exciting whiskies, and keeping most to itself. Fortunately, Warenghem Distillery in Brittany exports a number of single malts, which it has been making for over two decades. This whisky, matured initially in local oak and finished in first-fill sherry casks, has perfumy aromas that lift up its malt-forward character. Spicy and floral, with flavors of citrus, cherry, raspberry-jam cookie, salted nuts, and savory tobacco, it is delicate with a satisfying creamy texture. This is a reformulation of the previously available Double Maturation utilizing new cask techniques advised by the late Dr. Jim Swan. Number 6 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
1143,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Founding Farmers Rye (Batch #14), 50%<review>This rye was divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasting panel due to its unusual smokiness, the result of using smoked barley in the mash. On the nose, it presents as mesquite, cooked sausage, tilled earth, Lapsang Souchong, and dry leaves, along with saline and nuts. The palate is full, dry, and savory, with peppered smoked meat, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and big oak flavor. A short dry finish, with cigar notes, but little ash. Distilled at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits Distillery."
1144,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>Signatory 7 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1999 vintage, 58.0%<review>Tastes more mature than its age would suggest. It’s packed with ripe, sweet barley (especially at the palate entry). There are some high citrus fruit notes and anise that emerge before the signature Laphroaig peat smoke and tar wallops you. Very vibrant and youthful, but without being too green. A steal for $45. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive)"
1145,"<price>140<rating>87<whiskey>Chieftain’s (distilled at Glenturret) 21 year old, 55.8%<review>A comparatively rare independent bottling of what is, in any case, a hard to find single malt. Distilled in 1990, matured in an American oak hogshead (#646), and bottled at cask strength. White pepper, damp earth, violets, cinnamon, and slight saltiness on the nose. The pepper blackens on the idiosyncratic palate, with cough syrup, big spice notes, and dark berries. Long and peppery in the finish, with developing oak tannins."
1146,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey>The Fat Trout, 40%<review>Delicate nose of sherbet and melting heather honey layered over pleasant grassy and herbal notes. The texture is sweet, thin, and syrupy, with a slight vegetal note, before salted caramel reels it in, brimming over into a briny finish like a salty kiss. The grain clearly plays a major role. Truth be told, the aromas and flavors work well, but the lack of weight makes it feel like a tiddler rather than catch of the day. (Selected U.S. states, NZ, Switzerland)."
1147,"<price>59<rating>82<whiskey>Laphroaig Select, 40%<review>A new, no age statement addition to the Laphroaig family that blends together Quarter Cask, PX, Triple Wood, and 10 year old. The nose is reminiscent of freshly-treated decking, before some classic iodine creeps in. Water brings out geranium, pollen, and damp leather. The palate is simple, clean, and mild (and smoky), with bay leaf, light dried fruit, and that oily wood. Undoubtedly there's a lot going on, but it’s not married, and 40% means it lacks the necessary wallop. £35"
1148,"<price>134<rating>81<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 20 year old, 56.7%<review>Scooped-out spaghetti squash, whole red bird’s eye chilies, celery tops, and country ham. It is redolent of sugary-sweet candies like Spangles (from the 1970s). Light and delicate initially, moving into phases of vanilla sponge, dried raspberry, and peppery spices, then the vegetal notes grow larger in the later phases. An enjoyable effort from refill cask #10439, but it fizzles out, leaving a finish of light pepperiness, heat, and sodden newspapers. £88"
1149,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Tamdhu Batch Strength (#002), 58.5%<review>Historically used for blending, Tamdhu flies under the radar of many scotch aficionados. But this underappreciated Speyside whisky compares well with more famous sherry bombs by offering a sweet, savory, slightly funky depth. At first sniff, Tamdhu seems like it might knock you out with one blow—but this gentle giant is a lover, not a fighter. Viscous and meaty, this cask-strength stunner reveals dried fruit, dark chocolate ganache, ginger spice, and saline minerality, thundering softly into a long finish. Ian Macleod Distillers revived Tamdhu, and their pledge to bring Rosebank back to life excites us to rediscover more top-quality whisky with a distinct identity. Number 8 in the 2017 Top 20 
"
1150,"<price>50<rating>80<whiskey>The Hilhaven Lodge, 40%<review>Straw to light tawny. This blend of straight American whiskeys comes alive with wood, floral, citrus, and cola. The taste presents a heftier body than the 40% ABV suggests, with hints of coffee, nutmeg, and cornbread. This has a warm, astringent finish that gives cinnamon, caramel, and grain. Leaves me wanting more from the experience. Sourced whiskey."
1151,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Fukano Vault Reserve #2, 40.4%<review>A delightful fruity specimen, with lime, Asian pear, grapefruit, tangerine, mango, melon, taffy, and a hint of white pepper. More tropical fruit notes to enjoy on the tongue: papaya, dried melon strips, passion fruit, melon, and fruit syrups all floating along on a slick of gooey caramel. Continuity of the fruit-bomb theme continues into a finish of fleshy stone fruits infused with a sprinkle of gentle spices. (3,850 bottles)"
1152,"<price>35<rating>75<whiskey>McMenamins Billy Whiskey, 43.5%<review>An oddball whiskey by all accounts, with a very high 72.2% of wheat in the mashbill, distillation on an old farmhouse cognac still, and aging in a little Oregon barn in 63-gallon new oak barrels. The result is a strange, disjointed whiskey that starts out pillow-soft with wheat and caramel, and then dramatically shifts to raw oak, nougat, and cinnamon stick. The flavors in Billy don’t integrate well: they're like a jazz band severely out of step."
1153,"<price>636<rating>88<whiskey>Aultmore 25 year old, 46%<review>A wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400"
1154,"<price>24<rating>84<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Yearling, 46%<review>At 3 years, 6 months, this whiskey shows so much promise. As most young bourbons do, this one starts with hints of oak and a mouthful of corn that develops into cornbread and corn pudding over subtle hints of pralines and chocolate. Then out of nowhere, raw almonds and pecan shell. The medium finish ends with a touch of cinnamon. High hopes for this one. In another year or two, we could be talking about something really special. Price is per 375 ml."
1155,"<price>29<rating>86<whiskey>Grangestone Sherry Finish, 40%<review>Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy, with dough balls, then sweeter sherry notes emerge, with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate, black pepper, and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed."
1156,"<price>110<rating>90<whiskey>Westland Reverie Fig. 1, 50%<review>Each release of the limited-edition Reverie series will be different from the last, as Westland explores the boundaries of single malt blending. Spice and fragrant oak on the nose, delicately floral, with light fruitiness on the palate and a hint of peat. A spicy, white pepper note precedes a lengthy finish of apricot, honeycomb, and then more spiciness. This whiskey floats like a butterfly, but has plenty of heft, depth, and balance. (900 bottles; distillery only)"
1157,"<price>46<rating>79<whiskey>Tullamore Dew 12 Year Old, 40%<review>To a great extent, this is traditional blended Irish whiskey by the numbers. Its problem — through no fault of its own — is that it’s bland compared to the wave of full-flavored whiskeys that have been released of late. The twelve years in cask don't add much to the standard Tullamore Dew beyond a sharp note. The apple and pear flavors are perfectly acceptable, however, and the whiskey's pleasant enough; it's just not very exciting."
1158,"<price>650<rating>88<whiskey>The Macallan 30 year old Fine Oak, 43%<review>The whisky is quite fruity (green grape, orange, tangerine, and dark cherry), with balancing notes of vanilla, roasted nuts, and a hint of peat. Dry, lightly spicy finish that lingers. It is complex and nicely balanced for a whisky of this age. Still, I feel the 15 year old Fine Oak edition is better and, at $65, one-tenth the cost."
1159,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>The Tyrconnell 10 year old Sherry Cask Finish, 46%<review>On the nose there are warm, grassy tones wrapped in a blanket of sherry, apple, and sultanas, with a tickle of fine white pepper, lemongrass, scented balms, and poppy seed cake. In the mouth there is apple, cherry, and honey nougat, backed by richer sherry fruits. The flavor develops steadily, with late additions of pepper coinciding with a confluence of sweetness and sherry notes. Baked apple sweetness on the finish."
1160,"<price>155<rating>83<whiskey>Lark Single Cask, 43%<review>Expecting Scotch single malt? Go to the door and kick that thought right down the garden. Open your mind. Consider Australia as you do bourbon or Irish whiskey. It’s whisky, but not as the Scots know it — a new branch to the whisky tree. This is different, but special. Fresh, clean, young green apple, and pear, and not much else. But there’s a distinctive herbal rootsiness here that’s all Australian. There’s a clean sweet purity to the malt, too. Impressive. AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
1161,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Dewar's 18 year old Founder's Reserve, 40%<review>Available for several years, but now finally making its debut in the U.S. The higher-end Dewar’s expressions (Dewar’s 12 year old and Dewar’s Signature) are very good blends. This one is situated smartly between the two. The malt proportion is rich and creamy; the grain whisky is crisp and well-integrated. Antique gold color, with notes of butterscotch, vanilla wafer, strawberry rhubarb pie, and citrus drizzled with honey. Lovely floral notes in the aroma, along with a pleasing, dried spice finish. I could drink this stuff all day long!"
1162,"<price>144<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Waffles and Ice Cream (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 54.2%<review>Released in Wemyss Malts’ Cask Strength Single Cask Releases range. This expression of Clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead. Initially, big coffee and ginger notes on the nose. Sweet orchard fruits develop in time along with a pinch of table salt. Very sweet and spicy on the palate with icing sugar and soft toffee. Salt, white pepper, and light oak in a long, spicy finish. (274 bottles) £100"
1163,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Forty Creek Double Barrel Reserve, 40%<review>Similar to the standard Forty Creek Barrel Select, whiskymaker John Hall produces three different whiskies (rye, corn, and malted barley), ages them separately, and then marries them for a period before bottling. Unlike the Barrel Select, with Double Barrel Reserve, the resultant whisky is married in first-fill bourbon barrels rather than sherry casks. The result is a rich vanilla creaminess that coats the palate. Mixed in, you’ll find coconut, marshmallow, citrus, and pineapple, with emerging toasted pecan, dried spice, and dusty corn on the finish. Quite soothing and dangerously drinkable. My favorite so far from the various Forty Creek releases.
"
1164,"<price>110<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead’s Potter’s Indian Corn 24 year old Bourbon Barrel, 56.5%<review>Although much praised, Potter’s was a mythical distillery. It had no still, but sold whisky purchased from others. This straightforward all-corn whisky shows dusty corncobs on the nose, with sweet and sour sauce, caramel, oak, cinnamon bark, and intriguing hints of pine needles. The palate is broader, beginning with a very sweet and zesty spicy rush, followed by sweet wood, a syrupy mouthfeel tasting of prune, dark ripe fruits, and sour citrus notes. (126 bottles; UK only) £75"
1165,"<price>40<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend, 43%<review>Honey, vanilla, poached pears in cream, driftwood bonfires, and a sprinkle of wood spices comprise a clean, focused, and well-balanced nose. A golden and silky palate of sweet honey, vanilla, white chocolate, and lemon zest, with plenty of body. Enter caramel; the smoke cuts to the front, outstripping aromatic spices, orchard fruit, and baked citrus flavors. Compelling and moreish: drink whenever it’s raining in Glasgow and you can’t go wrong."
1166,"<price>54<rating>86<whiskey> J. Mossman Platinum Crown 15 year old, 40%<review>Nutty nose, with toasted oak, savory peppered meats, and traces of wood smoke. It starts off deceptively lightweight, with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by, chased by a gentle swish of spice. Light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. A tasty blend, but the nose will not be everyone’s choice."
1167,"<price>250<rating>95<whiskey>Jameson Rarest Vintage Reserve, 2007 Release, 46%<review>Jameson’s newest premium release. The combination of aging some of the pot still whiskey in port casks, including some older whiskeys (over 20 years old), and bottling at 46% ABV (and not chill-filtered) has helped make this a rich, deep, and complex spirit. This is a silky smooth, lush, multi-faceted whiskey with notes of honeydew melon, nectarine, banana bread, creamy vanilla, chocolate fudge, toffee, warming cinnamon, and nutmeg. The port influence marries nicely with robust oak notes, and the grain whiskey component helps to keep it very drinkable. A more intense affair when compared to the “great anytime” 18 year old expression. A classic after-dinner Irish whiskey.

1168,"<price>72<rating>82<whiskey>Belgian Owl, 4 year old, 46%<review>Distiller Etienne Bouillon and two partners, farmer Pierre Roberti and financier Luc Foubert established Belgian Owl in 2004 in the barley-growing region of Hesbay, pressing a 19th century Swiss ambulatory alembic into service. Bouillon studied with Jim McEwan at Bruichladdich, and The Belgian Owl shows something of the Laddie’s master distiller’s love of sweet spirit aged in first-fill American oak. Stir in some cream, sweet peach, guava, and mango and you have a lush palate. The youth is indicated by a little green almond, while there is a soft crunch of barley on the tongue. €46 "
1169,"<price>607<rating>90<whiskey>Canadian Rockies 35 year old, 50%<review>What a shame this whisky will sail to Taiwan with nary a bottle left for North America. It would be the oldest and most expensive Canadian whisky on the continent. And bottled at 50%, one of the strongest. Wood, age, toffee, cooked sweet corn, fruit, and slightly dusty new jeans. Gloriously sweet, showing its ABV in a blistering pepper attack that subsides into sweetness and a mild fruitiness. (Taiwan only) NT$19,800"
1170,"<price>47<rating>87<whiskey>Writers Tears Pot Still Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>Like the Writers Tears reviewed in this issue, this is from an independent company linked to renowned whiskey maker Bernard Walsh. It is described as of a style popular in James Joyce's Dublin (hence the name). Grain whiskey was a no-no at that time, so this uses no grain and is a mix of malt and pot still whiskeys. For its price and strength it is amazing — a big-hearted and full-flavored whiskey with an oily, apple-y pot still heart and cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper spices. €38"
1171,"<price>35<rating>83<whiskey>I.W. Harper, 41%<review>The base bottling of the “new” I.W. Harper from Diageo. Source is “new” Bernheim; no age given. Nose is simple: hard candy and corn. A fairly simple and somewhat thin mouth as well: sweet, with hints of ripe melon and apple, and an edge of oak dryness. Finishes well, with a cleanly sweet spiciness. Table bourbon, though a bit pricey for that."
1172,"<price>40<rating>79<whiskey>Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Smooth Gentleman,' 8 year old, 40%<review>Indeed smooth, and malty, with vanilla, shortbread, golden raisin, and macadamia nuts. Light oak spice emerges on a fairly quick finish. (It is only 8 years old, after all.) Pleasant and easy-going.
"
1173,"<price>81<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin, 57.2%<review>This NAS cask strength expression of Tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin American oak casks. The nose is sweet and fragrant, with vanilla, cinnamon, and developing coconut ice. Silky on the palate initially, softly spiced, with vanilla toffee, pears, and apples; then the spices intensify, introducing a hint of chili. Drying in the lengthy, spicy, slightly herbal finish. (282 bottles; exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) £55"
1174,"<price>156<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1991, 54.4%<review>A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The youngest of the quintet has been aged in refill sherry hogsheads, but the coconut that immediately assails the nostrils suggests they were made from American oak. Alongside this is the distillery’s signature pineapple note which sits under a scented, floral lift. Water adds a further layer of ripe pear. The palate is equally heightened with a powdery feel. It’s pretty discreet and I’d be cautious with any dilution. The finish is a mix of night-scented stocks, custard, and green apple. £95"
1175,"<price>29<rating>85<whiskey>Pig’s Nose, 40%<review>Stick your snout into aromas of rich tea biscuits, honey, tangerine, toasted almond chips, candied pineapple chunks, and a prickle of spice. It’s youthful but integrated, the grain domineering over the malt. A likable flavor sequence begins with lovely honey sweetness, honeydew melon, and pear, before a citrus phase, followed by an ominous wave of spice which vanquishes the sweet fruits, leaving a swift, spicy finish. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)"
1176,"<price>250<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Brora), 24 year old, 1982 vintage, 43%<review>Quite fresh for 24 years old. Invigorating notes of brine, spice (especially pepper and mustard seed), tropical fruit, and vanilla malt, and an appetizing, lingering brine finish. Well-rounded, and a nice balance between youthful zing and maturity. My only wish is to see this bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered 
"
1177,"<price>290<rating>93<whiskey>Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach) 1991, 56.6%<review>Full gold. Weighty, but not oppressed by wood. Full, rich rancio aroma, which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful, but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit, some spice, a lot of waxiness, licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits, and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky, and from Mortlach, with added elegance. Highly recommended. £198"
1178,"<price>90<rating>87<whiskey> anCnoc Rascan, 46%<review>One of anCnoc’s peated expressions, Rascan’s barley was peated to 11.1 ppm, and aged in bourbon barrels for what the distiller describes as “nearly a decade.” The nose gives sweet smoke, with ripe peaches and a hint of barbecue. Vanilla emerges, and the aroma becomes floral. Apples, vanilla fudge, and peat smoke on the palate. The smoke dries slowly, with citrus fruit giving way to oak and chile."
1179,"<price>101<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Breton 14 year old, 43%<review>The warehouses at Glenora are not heated, so aging virtually stops in winter. Thus, the whisky doesn’t reach its peak until its mid-teens. By then, it is malty, fresh, crisp, and grassy, with hints of vanilla and delicate, slightly bitter fruits, including apricots and citrus pith. Fragile floral notes join exotic hints of mango and a nuttiness reminiscent of almond skins and sweetened coconut. Air do dheag slàinte, Glenora, as they say in Cape Breton’s Gaelic Highlands. (Canada only) "

The palate starts with drying oak tannins but is balanced, offering black cherry pie, mint, cloves, baked apple, spiced chocolate, and cinnamon. The finish has hints of oak char, chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, and a burst of baking spice at the end. A delicious sipping whiskey. (200 bottles)"
1181,"<price>3000<rating>93<whiskey>The Dalmore 40 year old, 40%<review>By far the softest and gentlest of the range, and oh so drinkable. Hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old, actually, as it shows no sign of excessive oak. Instead, there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky’s foundation. Add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits, cinnamon spice, graham cracker, and lightly toasted almond. A gentle, subtly sophisticated Dalmore, and an interesting comparison to the much different, more visceral 50 year old. If I were a rich man, I could drink this whisky every day — it’s so easy-going."

Nose is bent with rye oiliness and a faint peppermint brightness. In the mouth it’s rye bitterness all the way through, a crisp, fresh-chewed mint in a mouthful of sweet grassiness, and then a very quick finish: wham, bam, and gone. Simple and clean; could add depth and polish."
1183,"<price>645<rating>94<whiskey>Brora 35 year old Special Release 2012, 48.1%<review>Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high, and this, the eleventh such bottling, does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy, peppery palate, while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1,566 bottles."
1184,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>St. George's Royal Baby, 50%<review>Another Royal occasion, another excuse for a new bottling, but this one justifies its existence because it brings tropical fruit and spice to the English whisky party. The nose is nothing to get excited about, but there's rich pureed pear and some orange peel on the palate, melon sweetness, and cloves and cinnamon. It wraps up with some pleasant rustic earthiness. £80"
1185,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Spice King,' 8 year old, 40%<review>Nectarine, tangerine, toffee, and vanilla on the nose. There’s also teasing smoke, if you look for it. The sweet fruity notes start at the beginning of the palate, then cinnamon, nutmeg, cut hay, and smoke kick in. Lingering cracked pepper, clove, and distant smoke. Good gritty texture. Dynamic stuff for a young whisky.

1186,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Blackadder 12 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1988, 45%<review>Pale gold color. Bold aromas of sweet wort, seaweed, and peat bonfires. Medium bodied and slightly oily in texture. Malty sweet flavors up front, followed by peat and seaweed, then taken over by a huge rush of peat smoke that never seems to end. A sweetness stays with the whisky throughout to help balance the peat smoke."
1187,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Reserve (distilled at Glenrothes), 18 year old, 1986 vintage, 46%<review>It's nice to see Gordon & MacPhail bottlings at strengths higher than 40%, and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so. It is fragrant (with subtle heather notes), rich and malty (and quite thick in texture), with notes of honey and vanilla. Interwoven fruit (sultana, along with subtle lemon and orange) add complexity. All this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long, dry, oaky/spicy finish. A delicious, evolving whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"
1188,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Defiant American Single Malt Whisky (Cask #6), 41%<review>Aggressive nose of bitter orange, dark chocolate, and pine comes boiling out of the glass. More gentle on the palate: the same notes, but wrapped in sweet malt. A bit hot and crinkly on the tongue, an assertive whisky, but it fades quickly at the end. Good flavor, but a lack of depth; everything Defiant has is right there on top, there’s nothing to discover. The pine is off-putting, too; not sure where that’s coming from."
1189,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt, 40%<review>Deftly blending the power and grace of popular Islay malts, this whisky offers a sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke on the nose. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, swathes of toasted spice, sweeping malty notes, delicious chocolate, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds formidably, until it engulfs the back of the palate. Sheep Dip whisky may have been around since the 1970s, but this latest creation maps out the best of modern Islay styles to great effect. A triumphant, approachable blend that shows great strength of purpose, yet remains full of charm. Number 13 in the 2017 Top 20 
"
1190,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Templeton Maple Cask-Finished Rye, 46%<review>A pleasant, honeyed nose of brown sugar, lemon peel, candied clementine, cherry hard candy, and light notes of herbs. The palate is liltingly sweet with an overlay of spice, as well as flavors of orange peel and marmalade. Water brings out notes of vanilla wafer, orange, spice, licorice, and black pepper. The finish is spicy but sweet, with hints of candied orange and vanilla cream, all punctuated by a spice-note finale. (24,000 bottles)"
1191,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Straight Rye, 47.5%<review>Very aromatic and pretty, with floral lilac, violet, and rosewater notes that follow through on the palate like a grandmother’s kiss. The perfumed soap and sachet qualities are underscored by oaky contributions of vanilla and crème brûlée. Perhaps not for everyone, but this shows another thoroughly enjoyable side of rye whiskey."
1192,"<price>85<rating>86<whiskey>Master of Malt Reference Series II, 47.5%<review>Now listen up class, it’s time for your next whisky lesson. Here the educational blend contains 20% very old single malt, which delivers a nose of citrus peel, honey, air-dried ham, and some spices in the background. Quite delicious, with orange, vanilla sponge, raisin, cremola foam assuaged by plain chocolate, and Black Forest gateau. This concoction is further tweaked three ways to complete Reference Series II. A truly great drink in its own right that makes learning fun again. £56"
1193,"<price>101<rating>86<whiskey>Lady of the Glen (distilled at Benrinnes) 14 year old 1998, 57.8%<review>This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65  "
1194,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy, 64.5%<review>Distilled in 2002, this is the youngest of the collection, allowing the vibrancy and boldness of the rye grain to shine through (and an interesting comparison to the Sazerac 18 year old). Lush fruit, Seville orange, gin botanicals, fresh mint, golden raisin, dried pineapple, coconut, and honeydew melon, tamed by soothing caramel and vanilla. Lingering dried fruit and spice finish. Not excessively aggressive like some young ryes I’ve tasted. I really like the dark sugar notes and lushness in this year’s release that provide balance. One of the best Handys."
1195,"<price>32<rating>83<whiskey>Thistle Finch Rye, 40%<review>New distillery in Lancaster, Penn. “Locally sourced” grain, copper pot still, unaged. Rich new-make smell, warm, full grain, rye oil, and anise. Light spirit: sweet, more grain and a character like pizzelles; sweet crisp anise cookies. Easily enjoyed, with a finish of more sweet grain and anise. Interestingly schnapps-like, given the area’s German roots."
1196,"<price>455<rating>95<whiskey>Brora 2010, 54.3%<review>Though Brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. Hugely concentrated, with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 
The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]£280  "
1197,"<price>37<rating>79<whiskey>Dillon’s The White Rye, 40%<review>It’s not whisky in Canada, nor does it pretend to be. Canada’s three-year aging law keeps un-aged whisky off the market. So, with no moonshine or firewater tradition, Canada’s craft distillers must make their white spirits as palatable as the matured whiskies they could eventually become. The result is simple, gingery, and sweet, with latent peppermint, licorice, and beer. The palate dissolves in a longish finish where sizzling pepper grows refreshingly bitter before fading to… nothingness. (Ontario only) C$37"
1198,"<price>1113<rating>80<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Bowmore) 1982 Lochindaal Catch, 46%<review>A slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender, sweet-cured herring, and then potpourri air freshener. This flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand. It starts sweetly with some nutmeg, then hot peppers. The smoke is very light, allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns. Water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume. Muddled. £700"
1199,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Chivas Extra 13 year old Rum Cask, 40%<review>Lemon and lime, grapefruit peel, and vanilla sugar are the most striking
characteristics, with base notes of caramel, milk chocolate, and dry spices to round off
the nose. Vanilla, fudge, and muted peppery spices on a lightweight structure, but it
blossoms in flavor—if not mouthfeel—with citrus peel, creamy milk chocolate, and
coffee notes, leaving cocoa, spices, and citrus acidity on the finish. (Travel Retail

Quite shy on the nose, even at cask strength. Ultimately, faintly floral notes, with pear drops, vanilla, and linseed. Very smooth on the palate, with soft fruity malt, vanilla, peach, and dark berries. Buttery mango and nutmeg in the finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (3,954 bottles)"

The palate is refined, offering milk chocolate, almond, cherry, baked apple, cinnamon, and ginger. Water brings gentle spice, and the madeira note. The finish is gentle and flavorful, with notes of chocolate fudge, more cherry, and soft oak. Elegant and rich, with the madeira cask contributing much finesse and flavor."
1202,"<price>54<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts The Hive, 46%<review>Having previously appeared in 8 and 12 year old versions, Wemyss dropped the age statement from their easygoing honey-drenched dram. Fortunately, the nose of light honey, lavender, heather, and spring blossoms confirms that it’s business as usual. Melon, mango, passion fruit, and a deft touch of spice give this a sweet, fruity profile. Gentle heat persists into the finish with honeyed sweetness. It’s crying out for a perfect scoop of vanilla ice cream. Still a crowd pleaser. £37"

1204,"<price>114<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor NC2 (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1981 vintage 18 year old, 46%<review>Glen Scotia has always been the bridesmaid to Springbank. This is justifiable, considering that both production and availability of quality bottlings have been sporadic over the past decade or so. I like this one. It really shows the simple, coastal pleasantness of this Campbeltown distillery. Ripe malty notes are accompanied by brine, cut hay, banana cream pie, and honeyed vanilla. Lingering salty, malty finish. With all the sherried and wine-finished Springbanks recently on the market (not that there’s anything wrong with that), here’s a nice, no-frills, Campbeltown whisky. "
1205,"<price>95<rating>91<whiskey>GlenDronach Cask Strength (Batch 8), 61%<review>As with previous batches, this was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry butts, puncheons, and quarter casks. The nose offers quite subtle sherry, malt, vanilla, dark chocolate, and black treacle. The palate is notably spicy, with hot ginger, black pepper, cloves, and cinnamon, along with sherry, cocktail cherries, more dark chocolate, and bitter coffee. Long, oaky, spicy, and drying in the finish."
1206,"<price>1013<rating>86<whiskey>Mortlach 25 year old, 43.4%<review>The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml"
1207,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Exclusive Malts Speyside 10 year old 2003 Cask #1781, 56.3%<review>From an undisclosed Speyside distillery. The nose is extraordinarily yeasty, with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. The palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice, apple, honey, and malt. At first these flavors are well balanced, but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. The finish reflects this and is quite dry. The parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong whisky.  (U.S. only)"
1208,"<price>39<rating>86<whiskey>Black Bull 8 year old, 50%<review>The youngest age statement Bull in the fold, this one has shredded citrus peel, fleshy grapefruit, candied orange peel, and lemon meringue pie. Soft fudge, honey, tart lemon, and buttery pastry with a nip of peppery spice under the tongue complete a satisfying combination. A delicious everyday kind of dram, and I preferred this expression’s brightness and attack of the flavors over the 12 year old."

Distiller James Marinus has been crafting traditional single malt whisky there since 2011. Barley sugar and a sweet waxiness lead into ripe red fruits and soft peachy sweetness, with mild spices and hints of mealy halva. Malty and mature well beyond its years, rising peppery notes introduce a long, sweet, grassy finish. Nicely balanced. C$70"

A delightful mélange of flavors on the nose—new leather, orange peel, angel food cake, orange Creamsicle, cooked peaches, sweetened ice tea, dark chocolate, nutmeg, and allspice. A well-structured, full-bodied palate starts with earthy notes of warehouse and then lets fly with flavors of blackberry tart, nutmeg, pepper, and semi-sweet chocolate. A lighter but superbly balanced finish adds more dark chocolate, roasted pecans, cherry, tobacco, pepper, and beautifully integrated oak."

Canadian Club recently pulled and vatted several of these from the 1970s. Acetone, Granny Smith apples, and fresh-cut white cedar showcase this long age. Complex and spicy, yet reserved, this dram is ripe with strawberries, canned pears, cloves, pepper, and faint flowers, then slightly pulling oak tannins. Distinct, elegant, and remarkably vibrant, this ancient Canadian Club is anything but tired. (Australia only) A$133"

The palate is sweetish, like gummy bears, and very spicy. Pepper, ginger, and hot cinnamon bathe in a weighty, creamy body. A longish finish shows soft, oaky barrel notes. (Distillery only) C$70"

There are hundreds of European distilleries making spirit, but few this good. Its malt and rye whiskies have always been special, but this is Premier League, a world class sherried 12 year old that matches many sherried Scotch whiskies flavor to flavor.

1218,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Boondocks 11 year old American Whiskey, 47.5%<review>Light straw color, but its rich aroma contradicts its youthful color. Marshmallow and cotton candy really come out strong, quickly followed by decadent bakery aromas. Fresh-baked muffins, heavy whipping cream, and vanilla icing, with hints of caramelized barley and nutmeg. Its weaknesses are a slightly adhesive mouthfeel and short finish, but the pronounced flavors still make it a borderline sipper or a just-add-water whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
1219,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Jura 10 Year Old, 40%<review>Despite close proximity to Islay, stylistically Jura make has far more in common with its Highland cousins. The entry level 10 year old variant offers resin, oil, cereal, and pine notes on the delicate nose. Comparatively light bodied, with malt and drying saltiness in the mouth, along with a hint of aniseed. The finish is malty and nutty, with more salt, plus just a wisp of smoke."
1220,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Gouden Carolus, 46%<review>Rowntree’s fruit gums, chalky Edinburgh rock, root ginger, and oat biscuits on the nose. It’s a double distillation of the mash for Gouden Carolus Tripel beer, aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, then finished for 6 months in custom-coopered Het Anker barrels. Those fruit gums are inescapable on the palate, but there is malt, warm toffee, apple, peach, and a tingle of orange. Gingersnaps, vanilla pod, and building tanginess spill over in the finish, which ebbs into a peppery haze. €37"

The deep amber color prepares the nose for what promises to be an exciting ride. Aromas of ginger, plums, cinnamon, fresh-baked cornbread, and fresh-squeezed cherries. The warm palate packs caramel, nutmeg, and vanilla with lovely cinnamon on the finish. Sourced whiskey."

The nose offers caramel, vanilla cream pie, cocoa powder, baking spice, baked apple, orange, marzipan, leather, and oak. Very well-integrated on the palate, but the high ABV cries out for water, which brings chocolate, butterscotch, bitter orange, coconut, almond, and creamed corn. The finish is a long, delightful reprise of it all. Editors' Choice"
1223,"<price>32<rating>82<whiskey>Deanston Virgin Oak, 46.3%<review>Finished in virgin oak casks, so I would expect to find some wood influence here somewhere. Indeed I do, particularly on the finish. There’s no age statement, but on the nose it comes across as a bit youthful. Honeyed vanilla, lemon, pear, fresh-cut grass, and wood shavings on the nose. More of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip). Very individualistic, but the flavors don’t seem fully integrated. (Perhaps a bit more aging in non-virgin casks?)"

A creamy palate offers milk chocolate, raspberry jam, orange, and lemon peel, with a peppery back note. The finish is long and rich, with a balanced oak influence, almond, and more chocolate. The aging lends complexity, while all is vigorous and lively."
1225,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>John Barr Reserve, 40%<review>This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish."

Don’t shy away from tasting this at proof, at least at first; it’s a gentle giant, whose savory character is well-served by the high alcohol. Cooked cherries, blackberry jam, iced tea, tobacco barn, and dark chocolate on the nose. It’s chewy and char-forward on the palate, showcasing dark-roast coffee, cooked cherries and blackberries, polished oak, dark chocolate, black pepper, dried chile, and a well-woven char note.

The nose is light and airy, with notes of confectioners’ sugar, orange peel, peanuts, coffee beans, and semi-sweet chocolate. The palate offers rich chocolate, bitter orange, light tobacco, and oak. The finish is barrel-forward, with chocolate, peanuts, orange, and spice. Too much barrel influence at times, but the balance improves with water."

Hand Selected Barrel and Northern Harvest Rye each peeked behind the blenders’ curtain. Now Blenders’ Mash (originally called Bourbon Mash) unveils the woody vanilla signature of Canada’s bestseller. This approachable, creamy, medium-bodied whisky bathes in sweet vanilla and mild oak tannins, seasoned with peppery spices and fruity-floral esters. Incredibly long, creamy, vanilla finish."

The age has softened the rye spice, making it an easy entry into the premium rye category. The balance here is beautiful, with rounded spice (mint, cinnamon, licorice root) on a bed of soft vanilla and caramel. Gently, dry finish. Very sophisticated for a rye. It remains my benchmark for extra-matured rye whiskeys, which are becoming exceedingly scarce. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."

A rich corn nose, with some wood notes and a slightly antiseptic sting of alcohol heat. Young in the mouth—cinnamon candy, a bit meaty—but all the right pieces are in place: warmth, corn, oak spice, and a smooth progression to the warm finish. Good already, and showing even more promise."
1232,"<price>800<rating>90<whiskey>Bowmore 34 year old 1971 vintage, 51%<review>A lovely example of a mature, sherried Bowmore. Its rich flavors evolve on the palate and are nicely balanced.

1233,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Spade & Bushel 10 year old, 57.5%<review>The Connacht Whiskey Company’s first release comes in small bottles, but it goes a long way. Whole lemons, yellow plum, pine floor cleaner, and a light smear of vanilla. Neat, there’s a real intensity of lemon-drenched sweet oak with a boiled candy finish, but it’s much more enjoyable brought down in strength. The soft fruits shine; it’s lemony though less acidic, and the barley notes show their best side. One of the tastiest sourced whiskeys on the Irish market. (5,000 bottles) Price is per 375 ml."

This first-fill bourbon barrel has more robust flavors but noticeably less color than its antecedent, Cask 1. Linseed oil, raw canvas, and freshly dug blue clay form a rich, earthy base for flourishes of clean spirit, dry straw, and Chinese plum sauce. Hot pepper and pulling dry wood yield to
cherry blossoms, maraschino, and sautéed mushrooms. A splash of water unveils milk chocolate, rye crisps, and creamy custard. C$100"

A nose of gingerbread, allspice, nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon melds with fragrant cedar chest, leather, and oak. The palate offers sweet blackberry, chocolate, raisins, and dried plums, along with toasted oak and tobacco, leading to a spicy finale. A beautiful balancing act and a wonderfully indulgent treat."
1236,"<price>250<rating>73<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Port Ellen), 1982 vintage, 24 year old, 40%<review>Port Ellen is going to just keep getting rarer and more expensive, and the quality is going to get more variable. This one shows the traditional Port Ellen characteristics (seaweed, tar, charcoal, damp earth, vanilla, salt, white pepper), but it just seems to flatten out mid-palate, leading to a fairly lifeless, slightly astringent finish. I feel like some of the guts were ripped out of this whisky. Bottling at a higher strength (and not chill-filtered) would have helped immensely.

1237,"<price>145<rating>87<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts Islay 7 year old 2007 (cask #904), 54.6%<review>An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke, iodine, paste, and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely, as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey, salt, and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry, long, smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (U.S. only)"
1238,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 26 year old Mortlach 1993 Single Cask (Cask No. 86), 60.5%<review>Intensely fruity and floral on the nose, like a rosebush-lined berry patch; there’s also shortcake with lemon drizzle, almonds, and orange peel. With water, the fruit character deepens and takes on an edge of marzipan. The palate fizzes with citrus and soap flavors, tempered by milk chocolate, tobacco, and bitter leather. Without water, it’s intensely drying, though with it, the character turns cloying: Tread carefully. (134 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
1239,"<price>110<rating>84<whiskey>Highland Park Dark Origins, 46.8%<review>Dark Origins is a new addition to Highland Park’s core range, inspired by the distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. The recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of Highland Park 12 year old. Chocolate malt, caramel, and ripe bananas on the nose, with a whiff of coal dust. Silky on the palate, with dry sherry, autumn berries, plus more coal and a spicy, plain chocolate edge. Long and dry in the smoky finish, with black pepper."
1240,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glendullan) 17 year old, 57.4%<review>I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat."
1241,"<price>26650<rating>95<whiskey>Bowmore 50 year old (distilled 1961), 40.7%<review>The whisky is sensational, a glorious mix of ginseng syrup, baked banana, semi-dried tropical fruits, and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last, you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time, there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect, thrilling harmony: light nuttiness, pollen, subtle fruits, gentle smoke, and light fungal touches. It’s stunning, but it’s £16,000! Whisky this great, even in limited quantities, should be fairly priced. Points off. £16,000"
1242,"<price>1058<rating>90<whiskey>Balvenie 1999 vintage, 46.8%<review>This 18 year old single malt is stylistically very different from the older releases in Chapter 4. The nose is soft, with honey and mashed banana. Ginger and crème brûlée notes in time. Medium-bodied, the creamy palate follows the nose closely, introducing vanilla custard, coconut, and chopped almonds. The finish dries slightly, with a hint of chili heat. £800"
1243,"<price>88<rating>83<whiskey>Hanyu 5 of Diamonds 2000, 57%<review>This, with finishing time in sherry wood, is the most straightforward of the quartet, showing lovely touches of Seville orange rather than heavy dried fruits. With water there’s a slight meaty/new leather note that seems a more natural companion to Hanyu’s density, here with an extra earthy note from black cherries, juniper, and star anise. Water triggers tannins but there’s enough fruit here to balance. The most successful of the four, with the wood in balance. ¥8,500"
1244,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Arran 10 year old, 46%<review>Launched in 2006 as the first mainstream Arran bottling with an age statement, it is sweet and malty on the nose, with fresh-planed wood and toffee apples. The palate is fruity, with ripe banana, honey, vanilla, coconut, and wood spices. Spicy orchard fruits and malt in the relatively long finish. Well-balanced and eminently drinkable at this age. The quality has improved since earlier bottlings."
1245,"<price>43<rating>87<whiskey>McKenzie Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Pineapple rings, lemon and orange wedges, and brown sugar aromas offset fresh pine and a bundle of herbs: basil, tarragon, fennel. The chewy palate is herbal and savory, with licorice, dark chocolate, roasted cherry, and plenty of oak, yielding to pineapple, orange, and lemon on the finish. The bump-up in proof from its non-bonded sibling bourbon yields nice results when adding water, which softens and expands the flavors."
1246,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Mosswood Barrel Aged American Whiskey 9 year old, 46%<review>Finished in barrels that once held nocino, a walnut liqueur. This whiskey immediately offers chocolate, oak, leather, vanilla, roasted pecans, and smoke-fired marshmallow. Then port, oatmeal stout, cherry cola, nutmeg, applesauce, roasted nuts, and caramel. The final notes are soft, but an extremely short finish erodes the palate’s promise."
1247,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Glenmorangie 15 year old The Cadboll Estate, 43%<review>This was produced from barley grown on the distillery’s Cadboll Estate and matured for 15 years in first-fill bourbon casks. Soft malt, ginger, honey, tangerines, and rose petals on the pleasing, harmonious nose. Rounded on the palate, with malt, more honey, white chocolate, fudge, and tangy citrus notes. Citrus fruit, vanilla, and cocoa powder on the finish."
1248,"<price>170<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box 'Lady Luck', 46%<review>A marriage of two casks of Caol Ila (25 and 29 years old) and one cask of Imperial (14 years old). Penetratingly smoky, visceral, rooty, and even mean-tempered at times, ultimately being soothed by creamy vanilla and thick malt. It’s peppered with licorice stick, dark chocolate, campfire charcoal, subtle olive brine, and teasing berried fruit. Long, clinging finish. The flavors are nicely integrated and complex. Well done! (A limited release.)
"
1249,"<price>800<rating>93<whiskey>Port Askaig 33 year old single cask, 50.3%<review>The nose offers canned peach halves in syrup, peat smoke, and brine. Oily in the mouth, with sweet orchard fruits, followed by a medicinal note, pepper, and dry spices. Plain chocolate and a hint of chili in the long finish, with a final touch of coal dust. (U.S. exclusive; 115 bottles)"
1250,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Aberfeldy 12 year old, 40%<review>Fresh and floral, with lively tropical fruit, honey, and vanilla. Gentle on the palate, with a slight syrupy texture to its malty foundation. Youthful, orange marmalade finish with a hint of spice. A pleasant, easy-going whisky."
1251,"<price>110<rating>85<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Auchroisk) 11 year old 2003 (cask #9), 56.4%<review>Most of Auchroisk's malt goes into Diageo’s J&B blended, so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. Aged in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a nutty, roasted malt nose. On the palate it’s soft and lush, with honeyed roasted malt, walnut, ginger, and salt. A spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. A solid mix of flavors, but the finish shows why it's often used for blending. (U.S. only)"
1252,"<price>70<rating>83<whiskey>Eades Highland 'Double Malt', 46%<review>A marriage of Ben Nevis (85%) and Clynelish (15%). A weighty whisky. Not as nimble as the Speyside expression below, but with flavors that linger. Rummy toffee notes, roasted nuts, earthy moss, jammy fruit, teasingly subtle black strap molasses, and clove. 
"
1253,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Ardbog, 52.1%<review>The follow-up to last year’s Ardbeg Day, here’s the cult distillery in its funkiest
guise with a nose that’s reminiscent (I’d imagine) of a frontier trading post:
all pitch, furs, and gun oil. Some mint hangs around in the background
alongside eucalyptus. This is an earthy, in-your-face Ardbeg with a hint of
box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. The mouth is thick and chewy:
wild mint, oily depths, and the slightly manic energy typical of Ardbeg’s young
years. Editor's Choice."
1254,"<price>78<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park Valfather, 47%<review>Highland Park suggests this is its peatiest whisky to date. Smoky roasted malt notes
on the nose, with singed wood and a slowly developing floral note. Initially, sweeter
than expected on the palate, with vanilla and apricots, then dark peat, licorice, and
treacle toffee notes appear. Black tea and black pepper in the finish, along with a hint
of pineapple. £60"
1255,"<price>500<rating>92<whiskey>WhistlePig The Boss Hog V: The Spirit of Mauve, 59.5%<review>Rich and mature with its deep flavors of spiced oak, figgy fruit, and varnish, turning to candy apple, dried flowers, hazelnut, torched sugar, and cracked black pepper. The palate is explosive at full proof, as sweet stone fruit gives way to earthy oak and tobacco. The calvados barrel maturation really sings on the finish, where sweet apple candies and pecan pie meet big cinnamon and ginger spices. Incredibly drinkable at this proof with well-balanced oak."
1256,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Mortlach 16 year old, 43%<review>With worm tubs and a fiendishly complex partial-triple distillation, Mortlach has adhered to an old style of making whisky — and older, richer, darker flavors. Big and bold, it is at its best in ex-sherry casks. The nose is meaty (think gravy/beef stock) with fig, raisin, and molasses. In the mouth it’s concentrated, with good grip and a savory sweetness. A cult malt. £41 (Not available in the U.S.)"
1257,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2018-04 “Kitchen Table,” 64%<review>A classic bourbon nose, as butterscotch hard candies meet oak, creamed honey, beeswax candle, licorice, and wood char. At full proof this really blows the doors off, and a splash of water cracks open the peanut brittle flavors, buttery biscuit, root beer spices, and oak. The finish rides on for minutes, a mouthful of Peanut Chews, dark berries, and smoky plum, with scorched campfire marshmallow."
1258,"<price>205<rating>92<whiskey>Lonach (distilled at Strathisla), 42 year old, 41.1%<review>I wish the owners of Strathisla would put out older expressions of their whisky, and here’s why. Layers of sweetness (caramel in particular, but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange, apricot, golden raisin, fruit gumdrops). All this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon, cool mint, nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. What’s most impressive here isn’t the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there), but rather the balance. This, and its lovely depth, with no signs of lethargy. Impressive!
"
1259,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle 20 year old Family Reserve, 45.2%<review>Similar in many ways to the 15. Less vibrant, more mature. Less corn, more maple syrup. Less nutmeg, more teaberry. The most elegant, sexy and stylish of the three and the best dovetailing of flavors. You might think that $90 is a lot of money for bourbon, but this whiskey is fairly valued when compared to other spirits of this age."
1260,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master's Collection 'Seasoned Oak Finish,' 50.2%<review>The fourth in the series of limited-edition bottlings, and one of the better ones. The impact on the whiskey of finishing in barrels made with staves that have been seasoned three to five years really is evident here. There’s plenty of wood spice, and I think it goes well with the sweet pot still characteristics. On the nose, the flavors are nicely intertwined. But on the palate, the sweeter notes (caramel, nutty toffee, fig, ripe berries, black cherry) appear first, with the dry, spicy notes (cinnamon, clove, cocoa powder, vanilla, polished leather, maduro tobacco) building to a firmly dry finish. Perhaps the dryness on the finish overstays its welcome more than I would like. But still, this is a solid effort -- and quite distinctive!"
1261,"<price>30<rating>84<whiskey>Doc Swinson’s Rum Cask-Finished Rye (Release 02, Barrel 09), 45%<review>Fruity and earthy on the nose, with orange Fanta, mixed berry compote, lemon drops, chamomile tea, fragrant oak, and caraway. The palate is sweet and gently herbal, with orange oil, cinnamon candy, chocolate, old-fashioned cough drops, and spearmint. Cinnamon-spiced pecans, chocolate, and sweet oak on the relatively short finish. This is simple but tasty—a painting in primary colors."
1262,"<price>170<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Garioch Wine Cask Matured, 48%<review>This is the first expression from Glen Garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks, specifically tonneaux de vin rouge barriques from Saint-Julien in Bordeaux. The whisky was distilled on June 23rd, 1998, and spent over 15 years in the Bordeaux wood. Milk chocolate-coated caramels, crystallized ginger, and cranberries on the nose. Autumn berries on the early palate, turning to cough syrup, with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. Caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish."
1263,"<price>78<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park 1990 vintage 15 year old (Cask #10146), 53.6%<review>The darkest and most decadent of the three 15 year olds here. Notes of molasses, demerara rum, apricot, and dates. More subtle notes of mixed nuts, sap, tobacco, and fig, with just a hint of Moroccan spice and leather. Surprisingly complex for a whisky this young, and the most intriguing of the younger expressions reviewed here. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)"
1264,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>Highland Park Fire, 45.2%<review>Fire is the first Highland Park expression to be fully matured in “refill port wine-seasoned casks” and it carries a 15 year age statement. Very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. More smoky, spicy fruit features on the palate, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. The peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. The port is pleasingly discreet. (4,938 bottles for the U.S.)"
1265,"<price>210<rating>83<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Glendronach) 1974 Vintage, 46%<review>An interesting whisky, with flavor notes I wouldn’t normally find together-golden raisins, green grapes, plum, citrus tang, fresh ginger, almonds, and a hint of mint leaves, all wrapped by a pleasing maltiness with underlying notes of vanilla custard. Fairly dry, slightly hot finish. Many of the Glendronachs (especially from the distillery) are sherried. Some of the sherried versions, like the 33 year old, are excellent. However, this is a refreshing change of pace. I’m glad they bottled it when they did though, as any additional oak dryness would be detrimental. 
"
1266,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>High West Valley Tan, 46%<review>High West now has aged whiskey of their own make. This oat whiskey was aged “less than two years” in used cooperage, and that’s just what it looks like, about chardonnay color in the glass. The aroma is mellow and sweet, with a hint of flowers and grapes. Clean and surprisingly mellow sweet grain flavors, even a bit creamy, but the 46% delivers a high bite. Very nice finish. (Limited annual release in December.)"
1267,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>The Macallan Select Oak, 40%<review>Straw gold. Well rounded, with fresh vanilla, berries in cream, caramel custard, toasted oak, and gentle dried spice. A really nice everyday, anytime dram. The best price/quality ratio of the range. (Price is per 1 liter.)"
1268,"<price>250<rating>89<whiskey>Ohishi Tokubetsu Reserve, 41.2%<review>
Components range from 7 to 27 years old, the oldest distilled by the current 6th-generation master distiller’s own father. Pepper, allspice, baked peach, white pepper, vanilla fudge, pancake batter, and orange essence on the nose. Cocoa-dusted red fruits, a burst of spice, then sharp orange, soft fudge, and red apple. Complex and piquant: fermented fruits, chocolate brownie, and creamy coffee to finish. Born to be mild. (1,606 bottles)"
1269,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Port Charlotte MRC: 01 2010, 59.2%<review>Distilled from Scottish barley in 2010, this was matured in first-fill bourbon casks and second-fill French wine casks before finishing in Bordeaux French oak. Fruity peat, salty vanilla, heather, toffee, and malt on the nose. Peaches and pineapple wrapped in peat, with marshmallows and rock salt on the supple palate. A whiff of iodine in the finish, with berries, cloves, licorice, and spicy oak."
1270,"<price>39<rating>78<whiskey>Hatfield & McCoy, 40%<review>Caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, generic sweetness. Smooth entry, and more of the same on the tongue with some alcohol heat in the finish. Very little wood at all. Begging to be poured into Coke. Maybe most jarring is that the Hatfield & McCoy “brand” recalls the infamous feud that took place on the Kentucky-West Virginia border…while this was distilled in South Carolina. At least the label’s honest as far as that. Sourced whiskey."
1271,"<price>167<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 1995 Feis Ile (2014 Release), 54.7%<review>A sherry-cask Lagavulin, this immediately shows a rich, mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel, but it needs water to bring out sandalwood, beach bonfire, kombu, Lapsang Souchong, and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick, unctuous even, with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham, membrillo, currants, blackberry. I’ve a feeling that this period will be seen as Lagavulin’s golden age. £99"
1272,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Balblair 1996, 46%<review>Balblair’s 1996 vintage expression replaces the previous 1995 variant as a travel retail-exclusive bottling, and maturation has taken place in bourbon casks. Ginger snaps, peaches, pineapple, and vanilla on the relatively light, fresh nose, which also has just a wisp of smoke in the background. Medium-bodied, the palate offers soft toffee, milk chocolate, spices, and the same fruit notes as the nose. The finish is quite lengthy, with a final flourish of black pepper. Price is per one liter."
1273,"<price>110<rating>93<whiskey>Old Bones 10 year old Reserve Straight Bourbon (Batch 5), 55%<review>A soft, sweet nose of vanilla, peanuts, licorice, molasses, cherries, bubble gum, warehouse floor earthiness, oak, cedar, and spice. The palate is chewy, dense, and mouth-filling, with notes of cherry, blackberry jam, vanilla fudge, almond, tobacco leaf, and soft oak. The long, rich finish is the crowning moment, ending the ride with chocolate cream pie, almond, a ring of tobacco leaf, and a balanced oak influence. Holds its power superbly."
1274,"<price>33<rating>84<whiskey>Chita Single Grain, 48%<review>At the moment, this is only available through Suntory’s Whisky Shops ‘W’ in Osaka and Tokyo, but as these act as mini-testing outlets, this grain whisky is one that should be noted. The nose is buttery and needs water to allow a flow of fudge, orange peel, crème brûlée, and green banana. It’s a bit like an alcohol-laced Danish. In the mouth there’s chewy toffee-cream sweetness offset by tart red fruits. A lovely, poised grain. ¥3,150"
1275,"<price>22<rating>83<whiskey>Canadian 83, 40%<review>After Crown Royal is bottled the barrels are refilled with new whisky spirit, to spend three more years in silent slumber. “Crown washes out the woodiness and leaves the velvet behind,” one distillery worker enthuses. “We probably drink more of this in Gimli than the rest of the country combined.” The steely dusty rye, charcoal tinges, blistering white pepper, creamy butterscotch pudding, and candied ginger of Canadian 83 are the restrained, confident declaration of hard-bit whisky makers. C$24"
1276,"<price>140<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenrothes) 20 year old, 52.4%<review>A delightful whisky with a nose of honey, nectarine, fresh apple, sandalwood, strands of lime, and sweet florals. Sipping unlocks flavors of apple pastries and orange peel, before a powder keg of spices explodes on the tip of the tongue. The aftermath has melting fudge, baked orange, and finishes with hot chili nuts. This hits the trademark flavors of Glenrothes, but the cask strength helps to champion the spices. (Batch 6; 430 bottles)"
1277,"<price>28<rating>89<whiskey>Gibson’s 12 year old Finest Rare, 40%<review>Fruit, grape skins, high esters, and oiliness on the nose yield to sweet fruits on the palate, with mild white pepper broadening into a warm spicy glow. The softness of barley sugar lends a creaminess to this mouth-filling, middle-aged gem before it resolves in a long spicy finish with baking spices and slightly pulling barrel tones. A Canadian classic."
1278,"<price>18<rating>76<whiskey>Red Stag Honey Tea, 40%<review>The first thing out of the glass is bourbon — 80 proof bottlings will do that — followed by a secondary note of strong-brewed tea with a dollop of honey. It's quite sweet, and hot, and the tea largely disappears except as a frill around the edges. This is more a honey drink than a tea drink, and there are better honey drinks out there."
1279,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Mossburn Signature Casks Series Island Blended Malt, 46%<review>Smoke and spice and all things nice. With Mossburn Cask Bill #1, the blenders created a finishing cask using first-fill bourbon staves with heads of heavily toasted virgin European oak. Baked citrus with some fresh grapefruit sharpness, raw butternut squash, and a cool line in salty smoke. The palate riffs off wine gums, citrus, savory smoke, bitter roots, pepper, and clove, leaving a long, smoky finish."
1280,"<price>175<rating>87<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Mortlach) 1961, 39 year old, 40.8%<review>Straw gold color. Very mature aromas of oak and citrus, with a hint of smoke, dry vanilla, floral and spice notes. Flavors are very mature and fairly dry throughout, mirroring the aroma’s dominant oaky vanilla notes, with citrus, and subtle smoke. Long, lingering finish. 
"
1281,"<price>600<rating>93<whiskey>Glenfiddich 1973 Vintage (Cask #9874), 46.5%<review>An impressive single cask bottling of Glenfiddich. It really shows the natural potential of this distillery. Nothing fancy here, just the pure elegance of Glenfiddich. Notes of shortbread, demerara sugar, and white chocolate, spiced with toasted nuts, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Very clean and polished."
1282,"<price>1600<rating>92<whiskey>Benromach 1974 (Cask No. 1583), 49.1%<review>This 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. The nose offers peeled red apples, sultanas, honey, fudge, milk chocolate, and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout, the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits, pipe tobacco, black pepper, and ginger. Long in the finish, with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate, and slightly smoky, unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!"
1283,"<price>116<rating>87<whiskey>Rock Oyster 18 year old, 46.8%<review>Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge, heather honey, and mandarin, which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot, drying, with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough, though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers."
1284,"<price>99<rating>88<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Pedro Ximénez Cask Finish 15 year old, 54.3%<review>This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. Lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)"
1285,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Grant, 16 year old, 43%<review>Thicker and fruitier than the entry level 10 year old, with greater mouthfeel and a drier finish. Orchard fruit (especially pear), kiwi, lime, and creamy vanilla, with suggestions of toasted coconut, hay, and marshmallow. Dry, gently spicy finish. A bit more involved than the 10 year old, but still with the same DNA. Very pleasant.
"
1286,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Small Batch Bourbon, 50%<review>If you wondered when you saw “50%,” this is indeed bottled in bond whiskey, with all the requirements that go with it. The nose is just this side of hot and brings parched corn, sawn maple wood, spicy hard candy, and dry spearmint leaf. Bright and spicy on the tongue; more candy and honey, and hints of teaberry and licorice that develop into the finish. A better package of flavor and price than the earlier Taylor releases; quite enjoyable."
1287,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>The Black Grouse Alpha, 40%<review>The Famous Grouse has been extended in various directions with varying degrees of success but for my money, this is the best and most logical. This is the version where the smoky, oily, spicy, and peaty notes of the original blend are brought more to the fore, but this works because married to it are grape and melon notes that ensure the Grouse lands softly."
1288,"<price>421<rating>86<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Westering Home 17 year old Feis Ile 2014 bottling, 52.9%<review>Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded Bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, Seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250"
1289,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Straight Malt, 45.2%<review>Much darker in color than the Classic bottling (also reviewed this issue), as is expected. The nose warns of a wood-whelmed whiskey: dark, bitter wood notes, with a caramel underlay. The mouth is much hotter than the Classic bottling, with bold oak spice in the front and a gooey caramel/toffee sweetness underneath…only it’s not as good as that sounds. It’s all rather one-dimensional, including the hot oak finish. An interesting lesson in wood, but not at $200 for the pair."
1290,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Compass Box Asyla, 40%<review>This radiant, refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge, light vanilla, fresh apple, peach, and biscuit notes on the nose, demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth, it’s luscious, balanced, and mouth-coating, with sweet honey, lemon peel, lime zest, and aromatic spices, fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede, riffing on vanilla, melon, and lemon biscuits. Dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits."
1291,"<price>132<rating>82<whiskey>Kilbeggan 21 year old, 40%<review>A limited edition blend of malt and grain whiskeys from some of the company’s oldest Irish stocks aged in a combination of bourbon, port, sherry, and Madeira woods. The nose of vanilla slice, marzipan, baklava, iced buns, and hay bales suggests that none of the cask types take overall charge. It’s mild and mellow, with rolling spices, honey, melon, baked lemon, and red berry fruits. Tranquil, easygoing: a moment of Zen. €125"
1292,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Single Malt (Cask 83), 46%<review>A growing number of Canadian craft distillers are making Scotch-style single malt whisky, and several, including Still Waters, do quite a good job of it. Round, leafy, cereal notes on the nose give rise to a granular fruitiness, delicate oak, caramels, and glowering peppers on the palate. It’s beautifully balanced, lush, and mouth-filling, and though delicious now, with a few more years it would be stellar. Lovely hot peppers, sweet grassiness, yellow fruit, and a long spicy finish."
1293,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Anchor Old Potrero Hotalings Bottling 11 year old, 50%<review>It’s nice to see an older expression of Old Potrero. This one, named after a whiskey that survived San Francisco’s earthquake and subsequent fires of 1906, is certainly more mature and mellow than its younger predecessors. But don’t worry: there are plenty of teeth in this whiskey’s bite. It is still quite spicy and herbal too, with strong suggestions of juniper (and other botanicals found in gin) combined with spearmint, Earl Grey tea, orange peel, coriander, and cedar, layered with sweeter notes (vanilla, caramel, and toasted marshmallow). If you took a straight rye whisky, added distilled (and aged) Anchor “Our Special Ale,” and then topped it off with a kiss of Anchor’s Junipero gin for intrigue -- that’s what this whiskey tastes like to me."
1294,"<price>224<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Fino Cask Strength, 58.3%<review>If you didn’t know what it was, you’d swear this was an old and venerable big sherried whisky, and it takes some accepting that it’s still a kitten. The clues are there: hints of immature green fruit and reedy barley, and the finish is sweet and soft, with none of the astringency of an old wood-influenced malt. But it tastes wonderful: rich, sweet, and grapey, with gooey plums and juicy raisins. A sprinkling of pepper dust reins everything in perfectly. €155 Currently not available in the U.S. "
1295,"<price>676<rating>88<whiskey>Douglas Laing Directors’ Cut (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old cask #10146, 53.8%<review>This example of Rosebank was distilled in March 1992, a year before the distillery’s closure, and bottled in December 2013. The cask yielded 141 bottles. The nose is light and mildly floral, with ripe pears, honey, and vanilla. Firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate, with a sprinkling of white pepper, plus summer berries and caramel. Tropical fruit, soft spices, and benign oak in the finish, with a final flourish of licorice. £400"
1296,"<price>300<rating>89<whiskey>Lagavulin 21 year old, 56.5%<review>A thick, sweet, weighty Lagavulin -- the kind you eat with a fork. Interwoven caramel and molasses laced with thumping waxed fruit, dates, burnt walnuts, and peat kiln embers that linger long on the palate. A mouthful!"
1297,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Bowmore 10 year old Tempest (Release 2), 56%<review>The first Tempest to be imported to the U.S. Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. With the bourbon cask, and relatively young age, you can really feel all the Islay love. Bracing, with plenty of sea character, along with honeyed vanilla, citrus, floral notes (especially lavender), rumbling peat smoke, tobacco, and resinous oak on the finish.  A bit steep in price for a 10 year old, but very dynamic."
1298,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Oppidan Four Grain Straight (Batch 001), 50%<review>The nose has berries in steel-cut oatmeal, bracing vanilla, bubble gum, strawberry Fanta, and yet also rugged earthiness: a picnic in a pine forest. On the palate, the grain is evident, but so too is drying oak, orange, cinnamon, and chocolate. Water helps integrate the flavors and enhance the silky mouthfeel, tying in Orange Crush, cinnamon, and espresso on the finish. At 2 years old, this bourbon is youthful but balanced, a well-constructed iteration of the four-grain (corn, wheat, rye, malted barley) motif."
1299,"<price>66<rating>89<whiskey>Springbank Marrying Strength 10 year old, 49.9%<review>A number of ‘Marrying Strength’ variants of 10 year old Springbank have been released, retailing exclusively through the Cadenhead Whisky Shop in Campbeltown. The 2014 expression is bottled at 49.9%. Brine, new leather, and pipe tobacco on the nose, with developing caramel. Maritime characteristics are accentuated with time. Voluptuous on the palate, balanced, with sweet leather, peaty spices, and apricots. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with black pepper and rock salt. Quintessential Springbank, and the best 10 year old sampled to date. £42"
1300,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman 2009 Vintage, 46%<review>Matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008, and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. The nose is initially flinty, with lemongrass, fabric Band-Aids, fudge, and vanilla. Ultimately the lemon is joined by Jaffa orange juice. Supple and sweet on the palate, with developing nutmeg and white pepper. Peppery in the finish, with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)"
1301,"<price>99<rating>89<whiskey>Glenmorangie Milsean, 46%<review>Milsean is the latest Private Edition release from Glenmorangie. After initial bourbon barrel maturation, the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted Portuguese red wine casks. Fresh fruits on the early nose, with ginger and a hint of musk. Coconut and icing sugar emerge. Smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time, plus lively oak spices. Lingering in the finish, with persistent spice. Finally, plain chocolate and chili."
1302,"<price>270<rating>90<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1996 (Cask #1306), 55.6%<review>The youngest of this Family Cask selection shows Glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light, with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine, marmalade, and orange syrup, as well as sultana, suede, wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram), and chocolate — a recurring theme here. It is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. Mature, but highly expressive, and a great starter. £172"
1303,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Ohishi 10 year old Brandy Cask-Finished (2020 Release), 43.7%<review>
Fully matured in cognac casks for 10 to 13 years, the nose initially has vanilla sugar, dried banana, lemon and lime hard candies, then pineapple chunks, lemon zest, pink peppercorns, and hints of pine floor polish. In contrast, the scrumptious palate is like a plate of homemade cookies, with praline, milk chocolate, dark fruits, caramel sauce, vanilla custard, and chocolate brownies, ending with a dry finish of lightly spiced cookie dough. (2,109 bottles)"
1304,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>George Dickel Superior No. 12 Tennessee Sour Mash, 45%<review>A nose of peanut oil, roasted pecans, dried figs, crushed herbs, dark fruit, and a light note of dunnage house floor. The palate is layered with flavors of allspice, dark fruit, bitter orange, dark chocolate, and cherry, balanced against drying oak and a light hint of musty attic. The finish dials up notes of fresh blueberry pie, honeyed nuts, peanut butter cookies, sweet red fruits, pancake syrup, and wood spice."
1305,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Arran The Devil’s Punchbowl III The Fiendish Finale, 53.4%<review>The third and final expression in Arran’s Devil’s Punchbowl trilogy of limited releases is a multi-age bottling, matured in eight oloroso sherry butts, eight French oak barriques, and five bourbon barrels. Only 6,660 bottles are available. Figs, dates, citrus fruits, and honey on the nose, with developing savory notes. Silky sherry, lively cinnamon, and red berries on the palate, with a hint of wood smoke. Lengthy in the finish, with spicy oak."
1306,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at BenRiach) 34 year old 1968 vintage, 48%<review>Benriach is a lesser-known whisky and, for a Speysider, fairly light in style. This one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon), pineapple, green grapes, vanilla bean, honey, and linseed oil. Its age is evident, but tucked away in the background. The palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. As you might expect for a 34 year old whisky, it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish, but the oak never becomes excessive. I can’t remember the last time I tasted a Benriach this good."
1307,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Hyde No. 2 President’s Cask 10 year old, 46%<review>Saturated with tropical fruits, banana, butterscotch, barley sweetness, marzipan, creamed coconut, and a fine thread of spice after the 8 month finishing period in dark Caribbean rum casks. This is a huge vehicle for flavor: silky and thick mouthfeel with sweet citrus, honey, mango, guava, passion fruit, Seville orange, and a sting of bitterness to keep your taste buds on their toes. Spice is merely a bit-part player."
1308,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>St. George Single Malt (Lot 15), 43%<review>Ages range from 4 to 16 year old whiskeys; seven types of cask, 100% malt (mashed at Sierra Nevada Brewing). Solid, hefty malt nose with fruit dressing and a fleeting hint of baking spices. A much weightier, more serious whiskey this year; the malt is meaty, savory, with an edge from the wine oak, and even a hint of brine toward the end. I miss last year’s balance and relaxed nature, though; there’s an air of trying too hard here. (3,000 bottles)"
1309,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Domaine des Hautes Glaces 100% Organic Rye (Cask #79), 53.1%<review>Explore the layers of this malted rye. It is herbaceous and minerally throughout, with aromas of licorice, chamomile, ginger, tarragon, incense, cooked pears, bread dough, cinnamon, and soil. The flavors express grain, minerals, and earth—tarragon, licorice, peppercorn, roasted peaches, walnut shells, and assertive but not overpowering oak. This young whisky’s flavors are from the field, fermenter, and still, not the barrel. Unique, complex, and exciting. (450 bottles)"
1310,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>Five & 20 Afterburner Bier Schnapps, 50.5%<review>Clear and unaged in a tall, thin, grappa-like 375 ml bottle; “Afterburner” is a bit intimidating as a name. “Distilled from grain and fermented with hops.” Nose of new make and hops, with aromas of rhubarb and fresh blood. Herbal and refreshing on the palate, bitter with the hops, a certain resiny stickiness to it. Much more than just new make; almost tonic-like. Nicely done!"
1311,"<price>379<rating>90<whiskey>Dublin Liberties Keeper’s Coin 16 year old, 46%<review>Mandarin segments, ripening lime, brown sugar breakfast pastries, cardamom, star anise, marzipan, and seasoned oak on this triple-distilled Irish single malt. It’s fruity, sweet, full-bodied, and wonderfully rich thanks to the Pedro Ximénez finish. It glides from tangy orange to marmalade, with fruit-flavored hard candy, clove, and allspice. They’ve got this bang on. The spices shut down quickly on the finish, leaving baked peel flavors. €340"
1312,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Ardmore Traditional Cask 1998<review>A single cask of Ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. This one is more mature, with more depth than the standard Ardmore Traditional Cask (which I rated 80 a few years back). Notes of toffee, vanilla bean, chocolate fudge, licorice stick, bourbon, tar, charcoal, and a hint of burnt raisin. Very nice! (A Julio’s Liquors Exclusive.) "
1313,"<price>300<rating>91<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Linkwood) 1989, 51.1%<review>Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex, but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask."
1314,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Copper & Kings Spanish Oloroso Sherry Cask-Finished, 50%<review>
From Bardstown Bourbon Co.’s very creative Collaborative Series—this one finished in oloroso sherry casks used by Louisville’s Copper & Kings to age its brandy. Mocha, oak char, roasted coffee beans, grilled herbs, leather, orange peel, and dried raspberries on the nose. The palate melds baked apple, more herbs, grilled meats, and pleasant oak. Raspberry and orange ride atop a bed of spice, bitter chocolate, and coffee to the finish."
1315,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 26 year old 1990, 51.9%<review>Can it really be six years since the distillery closed and they demolished the chimney stack? This nose has a much stronger grain character than the other two Old Particular releases, so one to try before you buy. Beach driftwood and toasted spice aromas, with flavors of warm butterscotch, mandarin, and peach on a peppery base, shuffling into dried fruits and muscovado sugar before a spicy nougat finish. This is hardcore. (K&L Wines exclusive, 243 bottles)"
1316,"<price>35<rating>83<whiskey>Rock Town Arkansas Young Bourbon, 46%<review>Smells sweet and minty, with gobs of oak and corn…and that’s about how it tastes, too. The corn sweetness and the mint are dominant, but warming oak spice wraps it loosely. It’s called “Young Bourbon” (labeled as “age under 4 years”), and that’s just what it tastes like, as some green youthful notes muscle their way in toward the finish. A bit of a rough-rider, but tasty. "
1317,"<price>83<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glen Moray) 14 year old, 48.4%<review>Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53"
1318,"<price>180<rating>86<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988, 53.4%<review>An uplifting nose of golden honey, linseed oil, vanilla, sanded oak, and wheat biscuits on this west coast grain. Neat, it is mouth drenching. Banana and ripe fruits are followed by juicy orange before a snarling pepper onslaught ensnares the tip of the tongue, igniting a glowing ball of white heat underneath. You can bask in this experience for minutes with each sip. Water emphasizes the oak and mellows the dram to the flavor of almond-sprinkled custard. (180 bottles)"
1319,"<price>35<rating>91<whiskey>Powers 12 year old, 40%<review>After being around for about a decade, it’s nice to see this whiskey finally being sold in the U.S. Soft, sweet, and silky smooth, with creamy vanilla, caramel, toasted marshmallow, and honey-kissed tropical fruit (mango, pineapple, coconut). I get most of the barley on the front of the palate, with the grain whiskey components more on the finish. Something seems slightly missing for me to elevate this whiskey to classic status (some more pot still character, perhaps?), but it’s still a wonderful blended Irish whiskey, and so drinkable. Gather a bunch of friends and throw away the cork!"
1320,"<price>120<rating>87<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at 'North of Scotland,') 1963, 46.8%<review>Antique gold. Thought-provoking aromas and flavors of molasses, leather, vanilla, and wood spices, with a hint of bourbon and rum. Light to medium in body. Given that this whisky is so mature and rather light in body, it has held up very well-the woody dryness is balanced nicely by the sweetness of the grain."
1321,"<price>119<rating>86<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2013), 55.1%<review>Though as pale as ever, this Lagavulin is hardly in need of a Charles Atlas course. The nose is ozonic, like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. Sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. The palate is explosive, with masses of retronasal action showing violet root, thyme, juniper, tarragon/fennel, and a finish akin to smoked cheese. An improvement on the 2012 release."
1322,"<price>180<rating>90<whiskey>Chapter 7 (undisclosed Highland distillery), 55.8%<review>Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476). Malt, sweet sherry, cocktail cherries, milky coffee, and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. Very rich on the palate, with chewy-sweet soft fruits, notably strawberries, syrup sponge, and lively fruit spices. Mouth-drying in the long finish, with aniseed and wood spice. (1,076 bottles)"
1323,"<price>499<rating>90<whiskey>Glendalough 25 year old Irish Oak-Finished, 46%<review>Taking a leaf from other successful virgin Irish oak finishes, Glendalough is the first to deploy this powerful tool on aged Irish single malt. Dark gold with complex aromas: treacle, toffee apple, walnut shells, new leather boots, hints of blackcurrant, bramble, prune, whole spices, and roasted meat juices. Sour plum, 100% cacao, peppercorn, cassis, and slight bitter tannic notes, becoming liqueur-like with dark toffee and roasted nuts. (750 bottles for U.S.)"
1324,"<price>40<rating>78<whiskey>West Cork Single Malt Whiskey Aged 10 Years, 40%<review>As the enterprising fellows at West Cork Distillers only built the place in 2007, this 10 year old must be sourced elsewhere. A decent nose with vanilla cupcakes fresh from the oven, dull lemon notes, tablet, and faint spices. It has a limited range, let down by a narrow flavor profile; acidic, lemony sharpness with a light mouthfeel. The sharpness strong-arms the sugariness for 30 seconds until toffee notes break through. An acerbic lemon bonbon in liquid form."
1325,"<price>84<rating>81<whiskey>Santis Edition Dreifaltigkeit, 52%<review>If you're looking for a radically different tasting malt whisky to anything else you know, start here. This is all Christmas church incense, burnt treacle toffee, charcoal, and overdone barbecued meat. Weird? Multiply by five and you're getting there. But I took this to a two-day music festival for 25-35 year olds, and of the 20 world whiskies on show, this was one of the most requested. €62"
1326,"<price>615<rating>91<whiskey>anCnoc 35 year old Second Release, 41%<review>Non-chill filtered and matured exclusively in bourbon casks. Very floral on the nose, with toffee and spicy new leather. Soft and slightly smoky in the mouth, with vanilla and spicy, ripe pears.  A touch of licorice leads into a long, slightly drying finish. (670 bottles)"
1327,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Jefferson’s Ocean-Aged, 44%<review>This Jefferson’s bourbon spent most of its life (almost four years) on a boat in the ocean. All that rocking and environmental conditioning has this whisky tasting four to five times its age. Yes, there’s plenty of resinous oak and leather, but there are also balancing notes of molasses, treacle, toffee, old demerara rum, and roasted nuts. A peppering of cinnamon, mint, tobacco, and maybe…yes, brine add intrigue."
1328,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Amrut, 46%<review>A mouth-coating whisky, and oily in texture. Ripe vanilla malt, peaches & cream, polished oak, roasted nuts, and a hint of coconut cream pie. Soothing, creamy finish. A pleasant “anytime” dram. Bottled at 46% to better display its fine textures and subtle nuances."
1329,"<price>44<rating>90<whiskey>Bushmills 10 year old, 40%<review>This is just a delight; a real flavor giver. A wave of honey sweeps along aromas of creamy vanilla, white peach, fresh citrus peel, white pepper, cinnamon stick, and milk chocolate. It starts delicately with melon, light grape, and vanilla, swells with citrus acidity and creamy caramel, ramping up to toffee, darker fruits, chocolate, Fruit Pastilles, and a little oak. The finish is mouth-clinging, with vanilla and spice."
1330,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel Elliott’s Select (2016 Release), 58.4%<review>There’s a certain complexity here that you just come to expect in limited edition Four Roses. This one doesn’t disappoint. Rose petals, honeysuckle, caramel, roasted pine nuts, cotton candy, dark coffee, and vanilla. The creamy mouthfeel delightfully brings in warm cinnamon roll, chocolate truffle, and honey taffy, balanced by herbs and subtle earthiness that settle with a long-lasting cinnamon-forward finish."
1331,"<price>108<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Garioch 15 year old The Renaissance Chapter One, 51.9%<review>The first of four ‘chapters’ under the Renaissance banner, all of which will consist of spirit made since Glen Garioch reopened in 1997. This 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks, and 12,000 bottles are available. Ginger features on the early, perfumed nose, with soft toffee, oranges, and dates. Milk chocolate on the creamy palate, where the ginger theme continues, along with cinnamon and caramel. The finish offers rich chocolate and orange, which finally fades. £75"
1332,"<price>68<rating>86<whiskey>Bruichladdich Scottish Barley, 50%<review>This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42"
1333,"<price>62<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfiddich Project XX, 47%<review>One of two initial releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this is a non-chill filtered expression. A vatting of twenty casks, including first-fill bourbon, sherry butts, and port pipes. The nose is fragrant and faintly oriental, with vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and apricots. The palate is full and sweet, with oranges and lemons, fudge, plump sultanas, milk chocolate, and tangy spices. Drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50"
1334,"<price>225<rating>89<whiskey>Talisker 25 year old, 57.8%<review>More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change). 
"
1335,"<price>168<rating>92<whiskey>Writers Tears Cask Strength Pot Still, 53%<review>Well, the name's spot on because at that price it definitely brought tears to this writer's eyes. What a shame, because the liquid is eye-watering, too, a stunning big bruiser of a whiskey that coats the mouth as berry and green fruits battle it out with oak, spice, and grain oils — the whiskey equivalent to one of singer Sinead O'Connor's rants — powerful, impressive, a little bitter and twisted, utterly unforgettable, and unmistakably Irish. €135  "
1336,"<price>40<rating>81<whiskey>Kinsey 7 year old, 43.4%<review>Smells kind of…Canadian. Light caramel, sweet candy, and a bit of oak. Light and sweet on entry; not cloying, with some hints of vanilla and fresh-sawn cedar. Body seems to thicken as it hits the tongue, and the finish spreads and hangs: sweet, with that very light cedary note. Simple, sweet, but not overly complex. Sourced whiskey."
1337,"<price>47<rating>82<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #9, 45%<review>Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

A much deeper, bolder, spicier, drier, and (at times) harsher bourbon when compared to the other two in this experiment, aged on the first and fifth floor. The wood influence (notes of barrel char, leather, and tannin) from the barrel dominate the pleasing sweet and fruit notes found in the other two. This is for those who like their bourbon with plenty of oak influence. Best served after a large, rich meal. Price is per 375 ml."
1338,"<price>58<rating>86<whiskey>Virginia-Highland Port Finished Malt Whisky, 46%<review>Scottish Highland malt whisky (from an undisclosed source; no age given), finished in Virginia, in Virginia port barrels. Rich port fumes hit the nose, malt’s in the background. Well-behaved in the mouth, not overly hot or obviously youthful, and the malt’s oily and luscious, with a nice port wrapper. Finish is cleanly integrated, without any heavy wood. Nice whiskey, interesting idea. Sourced whiskey."
1339,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength American Vatted Malt (Batch 001), 58.75%<review>This is a blend of single malt whiskeys from a number of U.S. distilleries, and malt indeed shines throughout. On the nose, there’s cooked apple and pear, with nutmeg, chamomile, milk chocolate, and salt water taffy, followed by a biscuity sweet palate packed with floral and stone fruit notes, milk chocolate, toasted almonds, cinnamon, and salinity. The dry, round finish has vanilla biscotti, gentle oak, warm almonds, and tobacco leaf."
1340,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Mortlach 12 year old Wee Witchie, 43.4%<review>The youngest of the 2018 Mortlach trio, this is named after the distillery’s famous small spirit still. Maturation has taken place in sherry and bourbon casks. Baked apricots and ginger on the nose, with black pepper, lots of milk chocolate, and an herbal note. The palate is mildly savory, with more milk chocolate, vanilla, orchard fruits, and cinnamon. Lingering chocolate ginger in the finish."

Peat smoke, freshly-washed hospital garments, antiseptic—typical Islay with a lot more fruitiness. Sweet canned fruit cocktail and persistent smokiness all wrapped together in a neatly-balanced unit. Hot peppers, hints of green licorice, and caramel. C$95"
1342,"<price>160<rating>85<whiskey>Springbank Rum Wood Finish 16 year old 1991 vintage, 54.2%<review>Pale in color, with a gold/green tinge. Exotic fruit (papaya, coconut, kiwi) with gentle sweet notes (vanilla, honey, pancake syrup, marshmallow), spiced with fresh, appetizing brine and anise. The brine lingers on the finish, as do some molasses toffee notes. Dynamic and well-rounded."
1343,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie (Scottish Barley), 50%<review>Bruichladdich describes this as a “multi-vintage cuvee” and only Scottish-grown barley is used in its distillation. Ozone, lemon juice, fresh-planed wood, and a hint of honey appear on the nose. The palate features toffee apples, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and oily oak. Pepper, sea salt, and relatively dry oak in the finish are balanced by toffee sweetness."
1344,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Booker’s 2016-01 “Bluegrass Batch,” 63.95%<review>If Picasso sketched bourbon, it would look like Booker’s, with deep golden and auburn hues. But higher-proof color can deceive. Not here. Think bourbon warehouse: oak, caramel, tobacco leaf, cinnamon, vanilla; floral with hints of honey and blueberry. And then it really comes alive. Oh, baby! Candy corn, crème brûlée, maple syrup, nutmeg, and traces of chipotle and cayenne. The proof strength doesn’t show. I recommend this batch neat for full, unrelenting flavor."
1345,"<price>160<rating>81<whiskey>Peerless 36 year old 1966 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 45.3%<review>Full gold color. Layers of citrus fruit on the nose (especially Seville orange, lemon, grapefruit), with just a faint hint of peat smoke and floral, herbal notes. Light to medium in body. It tastes similar in many ways to its aroma-there’s plenty of citrus fruit. The fruit comes first, followed by the classic ""older Bowmore"" oaky dryness. An echo of flavors repeats this sequence-first the citrus fruit, then the dry oak flavors. Some peat smoke teases in the background, but is mostly restrained. Fry, oaky, faintly peaty finish. This whisky is classic older Bowmore (30+ years), with its exotic citrus fruit, distinctive oaky dryness, and faintest hint of peat smoke."
1346,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Garioch 12 year old, 48%<review>This was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose yields Jaffa orange, plums, sherry, malt, and vanilla. Ginger, honey, more orange, dried fruit, and toasted oak on the full palate. The finish is relatively long, with spicy orange and oak. Complex and satisfying."

Rich nose of peat—burning leaves, a touch of sweet diesel—and fresh oak. There's no stinting on the peat; it's young, it's in your face. Whiskey to stand toe-to-toe with Portland's hopped-to-blazes beers. Not just peat: creamy malt makes a solid floor and an exit that may be the most complex part of the experience. Refined for a 3 year old. Limited annual release."
1348,"<price>120<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Old Pulteney) 21 year old, 43%<review>Gordon & MacPhail bottled a 21 year old expression from Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the U.S. market earlier this year. Sweet on the nose, with honey and vanilla; fleetingly, stewed apricots and peaches, plus a hint of caramel. Intensely focused, sweet tropical fruits on the palate, with barley sugar. Becoming nuttier, with an edge of mixed spices. Spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish, with just a suggestion of brine."
1349,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic Sherry Cask Finish, 40%<review>After 6 to 7 years in a bourbon cask, this is finished for 9 to 12 months in oloroso casks. Sweet sherry, glacé cherries, butterscotch, and roses on the nose. Medium-bodied, with caramel, dark chocolate-cherry liqueur, and warming spices. The finish yields black currant, cough medicine, then allspice, and slowly drying oak."
1350,"<price>199<rating>79<whiskey>Garrison Brothers Cowboy Bourbon, 67.5%<review>Quite dark for 4 year old whiskey. Nose is fierce, unrestrained by the glass, and full of caramel, baking spices, and dusty corn. It’s hot and oaky, but dominated by a broad cornmeal placidity that keeps the flaming oak well in check. Water brings out mint, but brings a cloying edge to the corn; it’s better hot and rocking. A huge evaporative loss made for a tiny yield, but even so, the price just seems crazy."
1351,"<price>14<rating>87<whiskey>Rittenhouse Rye, 50%<review>One of the best kept secrets in rye whiskey. Not quite as refined as the Sazerac Rye 6 year old, but it makes up for it in its sheer brute force. It is darker, deeper, and more rustic (but in a good way). Chewy toffee and dark molasses balance the spicy rye notes and soothe the alcohol heat.

1352,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila), 15 year old, 1991 vintage, cask #06/324/1&2, 46%<review>Very pale. A little thin in body, sharp and penetrating. Very Caol Ila-like, with notes of damp peat, Greek olives, seaweed, mustard seed, incense, gin herbs, freshly ground pepper, and vanilla malt. Smoldering peat finish. I would like to see more body to this whisky. (634 bottles produced.) 
"
1353,"<price>110<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 18 year old Dimensions Range 1993 (distilled at Aberlour), 54.3%<review>A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer."
1354,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Distillery Labels (distilled at Balblair) 10 year old, 43%<review>Independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail offers a variety of Balblair expressions, including a 1969 vintage and this 10 year old in their Distillery Labels series. Matured in a mixture of refill sherry hogsheads and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers rich, warm fruits, vanilla, sherry, maraschino cherries, and ultimately toffee and orange blossom. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity, with nutty milk chocolate, white pepper, and zesty spice. Slowly drying in the finish with licorice and light oak."
1355,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Knob Creek 12 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Coca-Cola, rich spice, dark chocolate, roasted walnuts, licorice root, maple syrup, Luxardo cherries, and varnish on the nose. Without water, the palate is chewy and full of puckering tannins; add a few drops to unleash dark chocolate, candied ginger, cooked berries, tea leaf, walnuts in maple syrup, black pepper, and a hint of orange oil. The lengthy finish offers chocolate-covered cherries, black tea leaves, and white pepper. Layered and engaging. Editors' Choice"
1356,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>383 Wink & Nod (distilled at Grandten Distilling),  52.5%<review>Single barrel releases aren’t uncommon at craft bars, but a whiskey distilled by the bar’s proprietor is rare. Dark amber color suggests high barrel impact, but the wood is actually well balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, and honey-nut cereal. The opening is much softer, lusher than you’d expect at this proof, and balances in the mid-palate with oak, salt, cinnamon, and a little heat. A dry finish rounds out a unique and flavorful whiskey. (less than 50 bottles; Grandten Distilling’s South Boston store only)"
1357,"<price>40<rating>76<whiskey>Loch Lomond Original, 40%<review>Since a change of ownership in 2014, the Loch Lomond range has been revamped, with the previous blue and black label single malt variants being dropped in favor of this repackaged NAS expression. Farmyard aromas on the early nose, then emerging malt and caramel. Discreet oak. Rounded on the palate, with immediate citrus fruits, toffee, allspice, and a suggestion of smoke. Spices persist through a slightly citric, cerealy, medium-length finish."
1358,"<price>125<rating>85<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice 1974 (distilled at Macallan), 43%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Rose petals, lavender, vanilla, soft fruity esters. Palate: Creamy vanilla and a touch of honey up front, becoming gently fruity with a soft maltiness. Clean, delicately complex finish of polished oak and soft floral notes."
1359,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>High West Bourye (Batch #17A09), 46%<review>Straight bourbon and rye whiskeys aged from 10 to 14 years, this nicely balances its dry oak, almost cedary, aromas with bourbon sweetness and a rye finish. The initial hit of orange peel, caramel, and vanilla flan yields to a spicy finish of lemon zest, peppercorns, and ginger."
1360,"<price>85<rating>93<whiskey>Doc.52 14 Year Old Straight Bourbon, 60%<review>A scrumptious nose, with PayDay candy bar, honey on toast, crème brûlée, cherry fruit leather, creamed corn, root beer, and horehound candy, paves the way for the robust flavors that unfold on the palate: cherry Coke, roasted peanuts, earthy oak, and layers of spices. You can taste the age here, encased in complex balance, a chewy texture, and pleasingly high proof. 144 bottles"
1361,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Straight Rye, 50%<review>Very different than other straight rye whiskeys you might be familiar with: there’s no corn in the recipe, just a large percentage of rye and a small amount of malted barley. It’s youthful, with spice as the defining character (cinnamon, mint, allspice, freshly ground pepper), balanced by blackberry preserve, caramel, butterscotch, and a hint of cotton candy. Lingering dried spice and polished oak on the finish provide balance to the sweeter notes."
1362,"<price>56<rating>85<whiskey>Dun Bheagan (distilled at Caol Ila) 1993 Vintage, 10 year old, 43% ABV<review>An unusual Caol Ila, in that it was finished in a rum cask. The rum influence is subtle - which I like - and it offers a new dimension to the whisky without blunting that Caol Ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. Olives, seaweed, fire smoke, salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. Peppery, smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire. 
"
1363,"<price>175<rating>90<whiskey>Four Gate River Kelvin Straight Rye, 56.6%<review>Initially, the nose is neutral and alcohol-laden, but notes of lemon, grape, and dried apricots gradually emerge, along with sandalwood, licorice, and herbaceousness. Spice, dark chocolate, bitter orange, and lemon show on the palate, as well as oak char, espresso, roasted walnuts, and herbs. More dark chocolate and spices ride on a long finish. Smooth but powerful, with light fruit notes emerging to balance refined herbs and spice. (1,382 bottles)"
1364,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Glen Ord), 1998 Vintage, 11 year old, Cask #3465, 60.3%<review>Bright gold color. Big and firm on the palate. Quite fruity too (tangerine, pear, sultana, pineapple), on a dry malty foundation. Lighter notes of grass, hay, linseed oil, and dried vanilla add complexity. Dried fruit and malt finish. A really nice dram with gobs of character."
1365,"<price>230<rating>90<whiskey>Octomore Dialogos 9.3, 62.9%<review>Distilled from 52 tons of Islay barley and filled into 134 casks, most of which were second fill. At 5 years old, the result is whisky with an initially fresh and zesty nose, featuring sea breezes and lemon juice. Mild iodine, ginger, and sweet peat then develop. Sweet on the full palate, with honey, cereal notes, smoky peat, and brine. Oak and chili in the ultimately dry finish."
1366,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Lambay Small Batch Blend, 40%<review>This Cognac cask-finished whiskey has light, airy aromas of vanilla cream, heather honey, golden syrup, flaked coconut, and whole orange. Baked pastries and tangy orange precede a mid-palate spice rush, with grapefruit flavors building through a lengthy, spicy finish. Several sourced Irish whiskeys use local water to cut down to bottling strength; Lambay uses water drawn from the island’s Trinity Well."
1367,"<price>50<rating>81<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Chardonnay Aged Bourbon, 18 year old, 45%<review>Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after ten years in new oak. The oak influence is significantly greater in this bottling. Briefly sweet up front, with caramel, vanilla, candied fruit, and golden raisin. Then the oak resin, leather, and tobacco leaves take over, along with subtle black licorice stick. The dry oak finish lingers. 
"
1368,"<price>1456<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1969 (Cask #2545), 57.5%<review>This comes from a refill butt and has a light, paler color. The lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster, syrup, hot green bracken, a touch of nuttiness. It takes water well, allowing pure, soft fruits to come through, and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth, while never losing Glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865"
1369,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box, The Peat Monster, Reserve Edition, 48.9%<review>Compass Box Whiskies celebrates the fifth anniversary of The Peat Monster by thinking big: bigger intensity, put into a bigger bottle. This bold whisky is packed with Islay and coastal character, showing tarry rope, brine, and a hint of seaweed, along with teasing smoked olive, anise, and mustard seed. There is some civility to the whisky: sweeter notes of vanilla wafer, baked apple, ripe peach, and cream attempt to soften the blow. Smoke and tar on the finish. Nicely done. (Price is per 1.75L.) 
"
1370,"<price>215<rating>95<whiskey>The Macallan Estate Reserve, 45.7%<review>Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel), with vanilla fudge, nougat, ripe citrus, and ginger cake leading to a complex, spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot."
1371,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated 21 year old, 48%<review>Scents of zested lemon, caramel, peanut brittle, and crystalized pineapple, with excelling smoke. What begins as a medley of toffee and caramel mingling with mandarin and lime soon shows plenty of bite: an eruption of peppercorn spices falls back to earth with flavors of hazelnut, ripe banana, and chocolate chip cookies. The finish dispenses dark toffees, Brazil nut, plain chocolate, and a little spice."
1372,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Glentauchers, 40%<review>Glentauchers distillery is another Chivas Brothers workhorse located deep in the Speyside countryside. Through the aromas of honey, caramel, and vanilla peek barley stalks, hard pears, and hints of Cadbury buttons. The flavor opens sweet, with red berries and Parma violets. Although this is intended to follow a lighter style, it’s very flavorsome, with creamy vanilla, poached pear, and dried apple. A juicy finish with fruitiness oozing from the cheeks."
1373,"<price>30<rating>81<whiskey>American Barrels Bourbon, 45%<review>Soft, creamy, and corn-driven, with sweet stone fruit and char aromas up front. The palate delivers on the nose; simple, direct, and enjoyable, pleasantly soft and creamy, then turning slightly nutty with sweet praline sweetness and a touch of cocoa. While lacking in complexity and verve, it shows smoothness for a whiskey aged less than 2 years."
1374,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>Parker's Heritage Collection, First Edition, 1996 vintage, 63.7%<review>Thicker, beefier and more decadent than the 61.3% bottling, but not as crisp. Less of the summer fruits, and more of the chewy toffee. Another fine effort!"
1375,"<price>700<rating>93<whiskey>GlenDronach 27 year old Grandeur (Batch 10), 50.1%<review>The tenth limited release of Grandeur was matured in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks. It offers a nose of ginger, raisins, old leather, smoky orange, blackcurrants, and walnuts. The palate is voluptuous, with full sherry notes, figs, dates, cinnamon, and cloves. Licorice and spicy dark chocolate in the lingering finish. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
1376,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Springbank C.V., 46%<review>A marriage of whiskies from bourbon, sherry, and port casks, which does help give it some complexity. A bit fleshy on the nose (sooty peat, soy sauce, sherry, tannins). It calms down on the palate (and is soothed by the sherry notes), with some additional vanilla, bitter orange, and brine. More brine and warming pepper on the finish. There’s a lot going on here, which I like, but I’m not sure all the flavors dovetail with each other well enough to deserve a higher rating. "
1377,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Bowmore Claret, 56%<review>Amber with orange and ruby hues. Aromas of Islay peat smoke, wine fruit, and background floral and spice notes. Flavors reveal more of what the aroma suggests-peat smoke, fruit, and floral/spice notes-with a balancing oak and subtle sea salt and seaweed. The peat smoke particularly comes in on the finish, lest one forgets where Bowmore hails from. There is no age statement on the label, but this whisky has been aged for 12 years in traditional bourbon and sherry barrels, and then finished off for 18 months in Bordeaux (Claret) wine casks. The wine fruit certainly is evident and, like the Glenmorangie Claret Wood Finish offered a year or so ago, will appeal to those with an open mind and willingness to accept new flavors in whisky. Purists will say it detracts from the distillery's character. I believe it's the first smoky whisky that attempts to marry these flavors with claret fruitiness. 480 bottles for U.S. 12,000 bottles for Travel Retail."
1378,"<price>449<rating>90<whiskey>Tomatin 30 year old, 46%<review>This expression has been finished for an unspecified period in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is floral, with gentle spices, honey, developing mangos and apricots, with vanilla ice cream, plus coconut. Sweet and smooth on the palate, with tropical fruits, more vanilla, and honey, plus old leather, and developing plain chocolate. The finish is long and drying, with slightly astringent oak and wood spices. (600 bottles for the U.S.)"
1379,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Cutty Sark Blended Malt, 40%<review>Remarkably light and drinkable for an all-malt product. Malty foundation with citrus (lemon zest, tangerine sherbet) shining through, along with vanilla wafer, white chocolate, coconut, ginger, and cut grass. A worthy “bridge whisky” for blended whisky drinkers curious about malt whisky, but single malt whisky drinkers might want more individuality. A whisky for a warm, lazy afternoon.
"
1380,"<price>140<rating>84<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 1993 (distilled at Glen Garioch), 52.4%<review>This 19 year old example of Glen Garioch from 1993 offers a nose of orange blossom, sherry, and milk chocolate, becoming sweeter with time. Finally, butterscotch mousse. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with cherries, icing sugar, and a hint of smoky caramel. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent citrus notes, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. (U.S. only)"
1381,"<price>105<rating>86<whiskey>Edradour Ballechin #5, 46%,<review>The fifth peated release of Edradour. This one is aged in Marsala casks. Sweet, with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. Youthful, embracing, and fleshy in the middle, with ash, anise, and espresso that grow toward the finish. These Ballechin releases keep getting better. Reminds me of a young Islay whisky without the brine and seaweed. "
1382,"<price>39<rating>81<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Rye, 45%<review>Aged 6 to 7 months in quarter barrels. Sharpish, oaky nose with a sweet grain/golden syrup backing. Spirity in the mouth, with a big slap of young oak up front that quickly subsides, yielding sweet corn muffin, white pepper, and dry cocoa that linger into the finish. Hot, but worth the burn. Some nice components here; age and a bigger barrel could do a better job on integration."
1383,"<price>69<rating>90<whiskey>Canadian Rockies 21 year old, 40%<review>A delicate dusting of exotic fruits and fragrant flower blossoms tailors this otherwise robust all-corn whisky to the Asian palate. Long development in the glass and in the mouth is typical of whisky that has spent many years in once-used barrels. East meets west as mellow oak caramels, pithy dragonfruit, and sour-sweet passion fruit temper fresh-cut red cedar, fragrant lilacs, bitter-sweet citrus fruit, and scorching white pepper. Rich and mouth coating, it fades slowly to sweetness. (Taiwan only) T$2,035"
1384,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>M&H Whisky in Bloom Lightly Peated Young Israeli Single Malt, 46%<review>M&H (Milk & Honey), founded in 2013, is Israel’s first whisky distillery. This expression and its sibling bottling Double Cask are M&H’s first to hit the U.S. Aged 2 years in bourbon, STR (shaved, toasted, and re-charred), and Islay casks, its nose offers candied lemon, lime leaf, tea, and licorice. The palate is soft, fruity, and spiced, with chocolate and light peat. The finish is spiced and lightly peated, with tropical fruit accents. Brilliant texture and an unusual spice profile."
1385,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Kornog Roc’h Hir, 46%<review>Made by the sea in Côtes d’Armor on direct-fired small stills attached to worm tubs, which the French elegantly call condenseurs serpentins. This has smoked fish, iodine, pine forests, driftwood, lemon zest, and clean medicinal qualities rather than peatiness. Waxed lemon, light fudge, lemon bonbons, and vanilla from the bourbon barrels ride a crescendo of pepper and ginger before smoke obscures all before it. A match for any Islay."
1386,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Straight Bourbon (Barrel #16B233), 47.2%<review>Released in the spring of 2016. True balance and consistency from nose to finish, showing toffee, saltwater taffy, cinnamon Jolly Rancher, crème brûlée, nutmeg, toasted pecan, chocolate, fruit, delicate spice. Hints of pear, peach, and apple. I love the coffee and hazelnut on the long finish. I wonder if the taste would improve in the 107 to 111 proof range. As it is now, this is a must-have sipper."
1387,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>St. George Single Malt, 43%<review>After twelve years, it’s time for a revisit. No age statement; aged in a variety of woods. The whiskey is a pale gold and has a pleasantly sweet and layered nose; honeycomb, dried apricot, sugar cookies, and hints of an ice wine richness. It’s a bit hot for 43%, which robs the palate of some complexity, but that honeyed fruit and cookie is there in the mouth, too. Overall, quite nice indeed."
1388,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Reservoir Wheat Whiskey, 50%<review>An unusual style, made from 100% wheat. Hints of stone fruit, brown apples, and molasses come cloaked in earthy aromas of saddle leather, woodpile, and husky grain. Shows well for its age, and quite smooth, but the oak dominates and aromas seem dulled, with vanilla, oak bitterness, and dark chocolate on the finish."
1389,"<price>69<rating>93<whiskey>Redbreast Lustau Edition, 46%<review>The 120 year old sherry house Lustau originally operated as an almacenista, but now produces a broad portfolio of wine styles in Jerez. The nose is intensely fragrant, bursting with fat dates and squidgy prunes, red apple and Battenburg cake. It’s fruity, yet bone dry, with oak, walnut, and spices. This is full-bodied yet refined Redbreast: the Spanish oak sherry butts shaping the red berry fruits, apples, marzipan, and creamy yet oily consistency. Clean, sweet oloroso finish. Qué delicioso!"
1390,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Bellevoye Red, 43%<review>The spectrum of aromas covers fudge, vanilla, a tantalizing crush of bitter grapefruit peel, lime pith, and Jaffa orange, with root ginger, spring onion, and cilantro stalks adding some freshness. A trio of unpeated single malts aged in French oak casks, this brings crème de cassis, mixed peel, burnt toffee, chocolate, and maltiness, with brief reminders of those green herbal notes, followed by a pleasing, malty-sweet finish."
1391,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey> Hillbilly Rye, 45%<review>Youthful and fresh, with piney and grassy aromas, Lemon Pledge, fennel seed, and orange candy. The palate is thin and spiky; orange and lemon oils mingle with fresh herbs and tobacco leaf, but the effect falls short of cohesion. It finishes hot, with more tobacco, oak, and a hint of lemongrass."
1392,"<price>86<rating>90<whiskey>Bakery Hill Double Wood Malt, 46%<review>This is the distillery's flagship brand and it's up there with anything New World whisky has to offer. The nose is subtle, with plum and peach; on the palate there are chewy orange and other citrus notes, honey, coconut, and caramel. The finish is sweet and rounded. A delicate and sophisticated whisky that reflects the rise and rise of this distillery. A$88"
1393,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay 7th Edition, 50%<review>As with previous releases, the 7th Edition of 100% Islay is produced from barley grown and malted at the distillery. Matured in fresh and refill Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels filled in 2010. Smoky ripe pears, wood preservative, vanilla, and apple purée on the nose. Fresh citrus fruit, buttery toffee, and ashy peat on the palate. The lengthy finish features licorice and cigarette ash."
1394,"<price>59<rating>88<whiskey>Ransom Whiskey, 46.7%<review>Nuts, plum, dried red fruits, plump berries, and oak on the nose, while the palate pours lush and fruity, with a sherry-like quality with pot still richness. Cigar wrapper, wet walnuts, and pine emerge to ride the wave of vanilla, soft malt, and spice-laced baked fruits. Offers the fruity allure of a Speyside malt coupled with American bravado for a long resinous and fruity finish."
1395,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Edgefield Distillery Hogshead, 46%<review>An American single malt whiskey that brings together the sensibilities of American craft with traditional Scottish and Irish styles with great result. Hogshead’s nose is bright and acidic, with pear, apple, maple, cinnamon, and malted grain. The palate is much spicier than expected, but enjoyably so, with black pepper, oak, cinnamon, and clove mixing well with honeyed malt and pear. The finish is long and slightly dry with a dash of heat. An impressive entry in the craft category."
1396,"<price>181<rating>89<whiskey>Douglas Laing Queen of the Hebrides (distilled at Laphroaig) 18 year old, 50%<review>The first expression in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular Consortium of Cards Single Cask Scotch Whisky Collection was sourced from a single refill butt. The nose offers sweet peat, toffee bonbons, brine, beach tide lines, and antiseptic. Finally, a sooty chimney. The palate is zesty, with ashy peat, asphalt, chili, and citrus fruit. Dark chocolate, more soot, and extra chili in the very long finish. Quintessential Laphroaig! (665 bottles) £140"
1397,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Auld Reekie, 46%<review>The old name for Edinburgh has been hijacked for use on this mix of Islay malts, and appropriate it is. The creosote, damp outbuilding, and oily rope nose is distinctive and strong, the peat pronounced in the taste, though gooseberry, green melon, and a trace of kumquat are also in the mix, and there's pepper in there too. But ultimately the peat holds out and brings up the finish. "
1398,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017), 45%<review>Ah, the pleasant aroma of warm rye rolls nails its opening, but so much more awaits. Balsam, peppercorn, almond butter, arrowroot pie crust, pine nuts, pumpkin pie, brown sugar, and savory toasted rye bread tingle, as slight hints of pear, tobacco, and citrus develop. Then, it’s earth, from sautéed mushrooms to soil. The long, strong finish presents baking spices. Lovely sipping rye!"
1399,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye Finished with Rum, 40%<review>Not a rum cask-finished rye, but a blend of Kentucky straight rye with Canadian rye and added blackstrap rum. The experience is sweet from start to finish: Sugar Babies and their parent Sugar Daddy on the nose, along with molasses, raisins, kettle corn, maple donuts, toasted marshmallow, and a little grassiness on the nose. The palate is sugary-sweet, with molasses, pralines, coffee ice cream, Raisinets, and some bitter oak, and it finishes short. Keep an eye on your blood sugar when drinking this."
1400,"<price>147<rating>86<whiskey>Smögen Primör, 63.7%<review>Pär Caldenby makes this 45 ppm peated island whisky off Sweden’s west coast, maturing it in 110L capacity virgin European oak and Bordeaux casks. Lemon bonbon, vanilla pod, crisped bacon rind, and burnt toast crumbs are backed with a blackberry note. The longer I nose, the more the peat edges over the sweetness. Syrupy with an intense alcohol flare: apple, lemon, and vanilla sponge, but dilutes to ground ginger, citrus, and herbal notes. The smoke is unobtrusive. Young, promising, and gutsy. SEK 1276"
1401,"<price>150<rating>82<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Glenlossie) 1975, 46%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Fresh cut grass. Damp grist.

"
1402,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 18 year old, 46%<review>A good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. A very nice whisky, although I wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?"
1403,"<price>850<rating>92<whiskey>Talisker 35 year old Special Release 2012, 54.6%<review>Talisker is a Special Releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles. "
1404,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Oak Cross, 46%<review>This has long been a core whisky for Compass Box, but the latest version of it is spicier and fresher than I recall, and without doubt, it's my new best friend. Virgin French oak heads help to contribute oriental and aromatic spices on the nose, with hints of melon and pineapple candy sweets. The taste is a delight, with spearmint, soft toffee, sweet citrus fruit, lemonade mixed with beer, and strawberry wafers. An array of spices from cinnamon to chili to ginger dominate the finish."

But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too. On the palate there’s plenty to be encouraged by, with some spearmint and menthol, developing fruitiness, earthy peat, and distinctive salt and spice. "
1406,"<price>69<rating>92<whiskey>Chivas Regal XV, 40%<review>Marmalade, almond, and cinnamon buns, this is a grand interpretation of rich and dry fruit, with an extra layer of lush fruit from the cognac cask. It is thoroughly integrated and the cognac is respectful of the scotch. The palate is luxurious with rich, dark fruits and toffee, velvety smooth, with the cognac fruit encircling the blend, and wood spice on the finish. The perfect dram for frosty winter nights."
1407,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Usquaebach Reserve, 43%<review>This blend is generously half malt and half grain, unusually selecting 16-18 year old malts. The result has a nose of rich honey and florals, resplendent in a citrus intensity: squeezed orange skin with a background note of dry crackers. The palate is orange and malty, with cola, faint spices, and a little waxiness, but the core feels a little hollow. A good length finish where the pleasant buzz has a slight peatiness rubbed in. A decent stand-up dram."
1408,"<price>68<rating>84<whiskey>Highland Park Einar, 40%<review>Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter"
1409,"<price>38<rating>85<whiskey>Jameson Round, 40%<review>This final lesson in the Deconstructed Series teaches us of the cask influence of the wood. The nose is warm and inviting, with toasted oak, rich vanilla, and bruised orchard fruit in a cider press. Sipping is rewarding: caramelized apple, oily pot still spiciness, toasted coconut, crunchy oat bars, cinnamon bark, dark treacle, pecans, and plump raisins. The creaminess of vanilla custard develops with dilution. If you’re late for final boarding, this is the one to grab. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
1410,"<price>48<rating>86<whiskey>Isle of Jura 16 year old, 43%<review>Antique gold. Gentle aromas of oak, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. Light-medium body, with a creamy texture. Soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish. 
"
1411,"<price>750<rating>92<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Private Collection (2018) 28 year old Midnight Blend, 42.8%<review>The end of a series, this fifth and rarest edition has worked leather, chocolate, dark toffee, cinnamon bark, toasted currants, charcoal, and smoking incense. The smoke is commanding but never domineering. It’s a contemplative and weighty proposition, dark as midnight, with plain chocolate, spices, and dark berries, with a smoky intensity following through on the finish. (3,888 bottles) Collectible"
1412,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Jim Beam “Signature” Six Grain, 44.5%<review>Caramel and vanilla notes, with a peppering of spice (primarily cinnamon, but also evergreen, cocoa, teaberry, and nutmeg) and subtle roasted walnut, finishing dry, gritty, and spicy (from the grains and also the oak). Spicier and not as sweet when compared to its sibling Jim Beam Black, an eight year old. There’s certainly a lot going on here. A very “busy” and intriguing whiskey for exploring and discussing. (Exclusive to Travel Retail.)€30"
1413,"<price>549<rating>89<whiskey>Girvan Patent Still 30 year old, 42%<review>The senior member of the Girvan range is very approachable, with a gorgeous nose like a hay meadow on a summer’s morning, while sucking honey-lemon lozenges. The fruitiness has mellowed, ripened, and softened with the extra aging. A thick, luscious, layered dram of toffee banana, sparkling orange peel, wood spices, ripe fruits, and banoffee pie lead to a mouth-coating conclusion of shimmering spiciness. This will fill you with joy and satisfaction. Grain can be this good. £375"
1414,"<price>135<rating>89<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old The Signature Blend, 40%<review>The nose is a little attenuated but shows off tarte au citron, cigar smoke, blood orange, and some gentle spices. The rich, fruity palate has a flawless, immaculate quality with tangy orange, spice, caramel, ground almond, vanilla, and orange sherbet, but what it gains in smoothness it loses in producing a substantial firework moment to really stimulate the palate. A polished blend in search of some perfect imperfections."
1415,"<price>60<rating>78<whiskey>Yellow Rose Outlaw Bourbon, 46%<review>Small barrel whiskey, 100% corn. Rich, sweet, oaky nose with—at first—notes of peppermint and Rice Krispies treats; nose collapses and becomes sharp, woody, burnt. Fiery mouth, smoky notes, dry wood, and hot mint are overwhelming and somewhat astringent. Finish lingers much longer than would be pleasant; hot and tingly, with a redeeming core of corn. Tastes like it was pushed, hard, to be done."
1416,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Jura 18 year old, 44%<review>Jura has introduced a new house style of ‘sweetness and smoke,’ and this spent 18 years in bourbon barrels, with a finish in red wine casks. Malt, peach blossom, raspberries, vanilla, and dark chocolate on the nose. The palate offers red berries, more chocolate, cloves, and peat. Dry red wine notes in the finish, with fruity spices and black pepper."
1417,"<price>279<rating>89<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Pe5 (distilled at Port Ellen), 57.9%<review>This, the fifth of TWE’s ongoing Elements bottlings of Islay’s legendary closed distillery, does not disappoint. The nose is akin to salted chocolate, with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. Port Ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells, while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss, marsh gas, and burnt cake. The palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. As enigmatic as ever, in other words. £175 (500 ml)"
1418,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Onyx Moonshine Reserve Secret Stash, 41.5%<review>Onyx (East Hartford, Conn.) ages their 'moonshine' in new charred oak barrels to make this expression.  Nose is fresh-sawn oak and sugar cookies, with a bit of cinnamon spice. Tons of fresh oak in the mouth (I'd guess this is small-barrel whiskey) with a spicy sweetness, a hallmark of young craft whiskey, as is the quick finish. Still, no real flaws, and pleasant enough."
1419,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Ohishi Brandy Cask, 41.6%<review>Lemon, lime, ripening apple, spring florals, clementine, and pear, among lilting sweet brandy notes. Calming, contemplative, and restful aromas. The mouthfeel is slightly musty, almost granular, with creamy light vanilla and juicy lemon and lime. The tip of the tongue burns brightly with warm spices. It grows heavier, the tastes shifting to lemon bonbons as the spice is annulled. A dying gasp of lemon peel, candy sweetness, and aromatic spices."
1420,"<price>191<rating>82<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Caledonian)  28 year old 1987, 52.1%<review>Overripe cantaloupe, green apple, banana custard, and whole almond are the main soloists, though they are accompanied by a linear grain overture running through it. A quartet of golden sultana, mint, ginger, and pepper play the opening movement, then sit back as toffee-dipped banana flavors orchestrate a delicious climax before a diminuendo into minor chords, with sour gooseberry and herbal notes to finish. Water works well, elevating bright notes of lemon sponge on the palate. (238 bottles)"
1421,"<price>38<rating>82<whiskey>Taconic Straight Bourbon Dutchess Private Reserve, 45%<review>Sweet and simple candied nose. Palate is thin, bright, and lemony, like a fluffy mouthful of sweet marshmallows, with hints of banana, circus peanuts candy, and gingery spice. Not especially complex, but pleasant enough."
1422,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes, 1991 Vintage, 43%<review>The newest expression from the 1990s. Heavier, richer, and more ripe that the 1987 Vintage reviewed above. It is very creamy and mouth-coating, with layers of sweetness (vanilla, caramel, light toffee, white chocolate), fruit (sultana, plum), along with a good underpinning of oak spice. A very nice effort for a whisky this young. 
"
1423,"<price>149<rating>91<whiskey>Murray Hill Club Special Release (Batch 1), 56%<review>Sweet scents of maple syrup, creamy vanilla, caramel, and rich chocolate start things off, enlivened by notes of pepper, orange peel, and bread spice. A chewy palate tastes of dark chocolate, cherries and plums, cinnamon and layered spices of ginger, white pepper, cinnamon, and cloves. A similarly spicy finish is balanced by plums and berries, dark chocolate, and oak. A balanced, dessert-like whiskey with beautiful sweet notes and much more."
1424,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Kentucky Vintage, Batch 03-65, 45%<review>Clean and uncomplicated bourbon. Creamy sweet layers of vanilla, caramel, and toffee are underpinned by soft citrus fruit, gentle mint, teaberry, and delicate oak. Here’s a bourbon certainly good enough to drink on its own, but you won’t feel guilty throwing it in a mixed drink. Nice for everyday drinking. 
"
1425,"<price>26<rating>88<whiskey>Elijah Craig 12 year old Single Barrel, 47%<review>Very much in the Elijah Craig style: thick and chewy, with layers of toffee, molasses, and vanilla cream. Notes of caramel-nut fudge, cinnamon bun, and blackberry brandy keep it fun. There’s just the right amount of dried oak spice on the finish to round things out. Very good, solid, affordable bourbon. (Capital City Package exclusive.)"
1426,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>District Made Straight Rye, 47%<review>Orange and flower aromas mingled with cinnamon candy, tea leaves, and fresh-cut wood show off the lively side of the grain from the start. In the mouth, this whiskey is spicy and vibrant, with chili pepper, Hot Tamales, green banana, and plenty of oak, finishing on dark chocolate, black tea, and lingering heat. A young whiskey, but well on its way."
1427,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch C917), 65.5%<review>When complex spice meets complex caramel, it makes for a wonderful American whiskey experience. That’s exactly what happens here with a cadre of baking spices over fruit, such as cinnamon baked apples, nutmeg sprinkled over pears, and peaches dusted with clove, followed by butterscotch, vanilla custard, and crème brûlée. The balanced and brilliant finish stays true to its complexity."
1428,"<price>68<rating>84<whiskey>Glengoyne 1996 Vintage, 43%<review>Exclusively for the U.S. as an addition between the 10 and the 17 year old. Central to its composition is a ‘parcel’ of refill hogsheads, to which a number of European oak butts have been added. Initially slightly herbal on the nose, with developing fresh fruits and vanilla. Finally, caramel and damp leaves underfoot. Full and confident on the palate, with tropical fruits, stem ginger, and hazelnuts. Drying in the finish, with spicy, rich oak and creamy allspice."
1429,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Egan’s Legacy Reserve 15 year old, 46%<review>There is a lot of pride behind this bottle, but undoubtedly its best features are the gloriously juicy mouthfeel and generosity of flavor. Orchard fruit, creamy vanilla, and freshly sliced orange square up to a company of spices: a mix of dried cumin, cayenne, paprika, and black pepper. Heavy and tangy, the orange conquers the initial charge of spices, with flanking maneuvers from lemon and bitter peels giving close support. (1,000 bottles for U.S.)"
1430,"<price>22<rating>70<whiskey>American Born Apple Pie Moonshine, 41.5%<review>Spiced apple cider on the nose is a little more spice than cider, with strong cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Baked apple is there on the opening, but it doesn’t take long for the spices to take over, especially the cinnamon, which dominates. The cinnamon here leans more toward Red Hots than cinnamon stick, and by the time we get to the finish, it has completely conquered this spirit. May have been better labeled Spicy Cinnamon Apple Pie Moonshine."
1431,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2010, 50%<review>Distilling with heirloom grains has become commonplace in the U.S., but much less so in Scotland. With this utterly unique single malt made from the historic Bere barley variety, Bruichladdich reexamines whisky flavors starting with the raw material. Herbal pine bough, salted almond, and tropical fruit appear on the nose, followed by a creamy mouthfeel with intense chocolate, pepper, citrus oil, pine sap, and perfumy chamomile flavors. The full, round finish has rose petal, white pepper, and vanilla overlaying a delicate but pronounced structure. Number 15 in the 2019 Top 20 "
1432,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Dogfish Head Alternate Takes Vol. 1: Whiskey Finished in Rum Casks, 45%<review>An intriguing first release from one of craft beer’s most inventive producers. Like many whiskeys made by brewers, this one’s charm is in its deceptive simplicity that reveals successively complex character with every sip. The rum-cask finish is evident throughout: caramel-banana sundae, marzipan, and pistachio pudding on the nose, along with rose petals, meringue, and a touch of suntan lotion. The palate has fresh banana, rose water, pistachio kheer, almonds, lemon, and lime sherbet. Oak asserts itself on the perfumy, elegant finish."
1433,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>GlenDronach 1990 vintage 20 year old Oloroso (cask 2621), 57.9%<review>If every fan of sherried whisky has a favorite GlenDronach then this is a long way down the road to being mine. It has a dusty dried orange peel, powdery, and perfumey nose, a soft and sweet round palate with a dark chocolate, tangerine, and pink grapefruit heart, and a balanced and gentle finish. This was probably once a hollerin’ maned lion of a malt, but it’s grown old gracefully and it now purrs and growls beautifully. £80 "
1434,"<price>80<rating>95<whiskey>Parker's Heritage Collection, First Edition, 1996 vintage, 61.3%<review>There are two noteworthy items regarding this whiskey. It’s the first barrel-proof whiskey released by Heaven Hill for the U.S. market. It’s also the first of what will be an ongoing series of releases under the “Parker’s Heritage Collection” label. This one is rich, with thick toffee, molasses, vanilla fudge, and Heath bar. It’s also well balanced, with underlying exotic spice, summer fruit, dusty corn, and tobacco to balance the sweeter notes. Long, soothing, finish. A nicely matured bourbon of character and pedigree. (Originally reviewed in Volume 16, No. 4)

1435,"<price>105<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Clynelish) “A Day at the Coast” 14 year old, 46%<review>One of the latest single cask bottlings (354 bottles) from Wemyss Malts specifically for the U.S., “A Day at the Coast” was sourced from the East Sutherland distillery of Clynelish. Ozone, warm sand, and wild grasses on the nose, plus a hint of honey, grated ginger, and a freshly-opened box of milk chocolates. The viscous palate features rock salt, white pepper, coconut, green apples, and a squeeze of lemon. Medium to long in the finish, softly citric, and salty."
1436,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Oregon Spirit Bottled in Bond Bourbon, 50%<review>Pleasantly aromatic of oranges and dusty oak, turning more oily, chewy, and nutty on the palate, with honeycomb intensity. However, the tannins are quite aggressive, suggesting green walnut hulls and wooden popsicle stick."
1437,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Abraham Bowman Vanilla Bean Infused, 45%<review>Chopped vanilla beans were added to barrels of Bowman bourbon (in varying amounts); the barrels were married after 24 months and bottled. The nose has soft vanilla and sweet orange; it's almost soothing, balm-like. Vanilla is not at all overpowering in the mouth, but shows more as a richness around the edges. Otherwise, a good, sprightly bourbon with a nice citrus and oak finish; like to try this in a cocktail."
1438,"<price>66<rating>84<whiskey>Broger Riebelmais, 42%<review>A few years ago, Broger branched out from eau de vie into whisky making in their Carl artisan still. This one is made from 100% Voralberg Riebel maize matured for four years before finishing in Sauternes casks from Château d’Yquem. There are pronounced sweet aromas, with kernels of cooked corn and potato scones. Fruity, clean-cut, and refreshing lemon sherbet and light butterscotch, but the sweetness is kept in check, even with a cream and sugar finish. A handsome introduction. €48"

Quite herbal, with tarragon, cilantro, boiled candies, and unripe plums. A slow starter; vegetal notes yield to fudge, milk chocolate, orange, and maltiness, with pepper, oak, and spices in the latter phases. Stocked in only five U.S. retailers."
1440,"<price>63<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Arran) 12 year old, 46%<review>Distilled in February 2000 and matured in a single refill hogshead, this example of Arran is part of the Provenance range which highlights the season of distillation on the bottle label. Malt, salt, milk chocolate, vanilla, and developing citrus notes on the fragrant nose. Quite full in the mouth, fruity and zesty, with a hint of grist. Long and softly spiced in the finish, with almonds and a final suggestion of aniseed. £40"
1441,"<price>300<rating>91<whiskey>Big Peat Platinum 26 year old, 51.8%<review>A larger and mightier beast overall, with menthol, mint Life Savers, raisins, chocolate wafer bars, and thick gray smoke lifting off smoldering peat. The experience is mouth drawing and full bodied at this strength, with sweet orange, milk chocolate, clove, and nutmeg, the roof of the palate cloaked in a night sky of celestial peppery spices. Take it easy with water, but use it to unshackle the soaring citrus notes. (1,100 bottles for the U.S.)"
1442,"<price>22<rating>85<whiskey>Canadian Club Classic 12, 40% ABV<review>Nose is much more integrated than the others; caramel and light honey tones with an oaky vein. After four CCs that were sequentially innocent, clumsy, eager, and balanced, this one is confident: well-rounded, sweet but not goopy, oaked but not prickly. Well-named: this is a classic Canadian.  "
1443,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye, 59.8%<review>Dripping with caramel and tingling with spice, this is a blockbuster whiskey that delivers across a spectrum of flavors. Maple syrup, sugar in the raw, and caramel-drizzled flan highlight the aroma, while the palate turns fruity and tropical with the sweet drive of peach nectar, grilled fruits, and pineapple upside-down cake. At the same time, it’s lemony bright, warmly spiced, tremendously rich, and oh-so-good! Pour on the water and enjoy the ride!"
1444,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Saint Lawrence Spirits Kentucky Son Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Rich aromas of marzipan, black tea, blackberry, cherry, chocolate, brown sugar, and tobacco leaves. The palate is chewy, with oak char, black tea, roasted nuts, semi-sweet chocolate, root beer spices, ginger, red apple, and mint; water brings out cinnamon and pecans. It shows vivaciousness into the finish, with more oak char, mint, black pepper, and chocolate-covered almonds. (2,000 bottles)"
1445,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>FEW Bourbon, 46.5%<review>There is a freshness to the wood on the nose, laced with caramel and delicate minty notes. The palate pours pleasantly chewy with molten butterscotch and offers a pleasant jolt of cinnamon and clove that suggests rye at work, before settling on bitter orange peel, salted caramel, and cocoa, leading to a drying leathery and warm spice finish. Nicely done."

Orange blossom, tropical notes of lime, pineapple, and guava, as well as fruitcake, powdered sugar, maple syrup, and balanced oak on the nose. More tropical notes and powdered sugar follow on the palate, along with hot chocolate, roasted nuts, grain notes, pepper, and barrel char. Light tropical flavors return on a long finish interwoven with chocolate, tobacco, and barrel notes. Unconventional and intensely racy, with an intriguing, complex interplay of diverse flavors."
1447,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey> Deadwood Rye, 41.5%<review>Named for the town of Deadwood, S.D., where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876. A blend of two rye mashbills, 95% rye and 70% rye, aged at least 2 years in American oak. Orange blossom on the nose, herbal notes, pine nuts, anise, and fragrant oak. A honeyed palate offers kiwi, tangerine, and orange, balanced against bitter chocolate and espresso. The finish is sweet, with floral orange notes and chocolate syrup."
1448,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Five & 20 Spirits Rye (batch 3), 45%<review>There is lovely freshness here, with sawn oak, bread dough, and baking spice aromas. Despite the generous 80% rye content, the malt component really comes through, offering good backbone, creamy caramel sweetness, and approachability. A streak of pleasingly peppery rye is balanced with sweet vanilla, leading to a lively finish with mint and chocolate malt balls."
1449,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park The Light 17 year old, 52.9%<review>Following last year’s release of The Dark, this parallel 17 year old cask-strength expression was matured in refill American oak. The nose yields vanilla, oats, ripe pears, and mild wood-fire embers. Supple and initially sweet on the palate, with icing sugar, tangerines, and developing darker, spicier notes. Lengthy in the finish, with spicy cedar oil. Proof that Highland Park doesn’t need sherry casks to be good. (4,500 bottles for U.S.)"
1450,"<price>92<rating>88<whiskey>Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>An aroma you can really chew on, this comes at you big and bold, its dried cherry, fig, and caramel flavors woven with pipe tobacco, licorice, and saddle leather. The jolt of sweetness and spice on the palate pour on and on. Water helps to temper the heat and release even more flavors, with currant, chocolate, and drying oak on the finish. Sourced Indiana bourbon finished in oloroso sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Cognac casks."
1451,"<price>52<rating>91<whiskey>Waldviertler Whisky J.H. Original Rye, 41%<review>Jasmin Haider-Stadler is the second-generation distiller at Austria’s most-visited distillery. The distillery is particularly noted for its rye whiskies and this is their best seller, made from 60% rye and 40% malted barley. The nose has nutmeg and cinnamon spices, milk chocolate, and dark fruits. An ever-changing spectrum of flavors delights the palate: vanilla, crisp cinnamon, dusty cocoa, hot chocolate, pepper, and bramble jelly. Any keen importers reading this? €47"
1452,"<price>55<rating>82<whiskey>Smokehead, 43%<review>Youthful and fiery, oozing with testosterone. Toffee apple intoxicated with kiln-trapped peat smoke, charcoal ash, anise, honeyed malt, brine, peppered seaweed, kippers, and damp earth. Brisk and warming. Okay, this is a young, “in your face” Islay single malt. Young Islay whiskies show the true character of Islay (which I like), and this is a young one. Ideally, I’d like to see another five years, not chill-filtered, and bottled at 46% ABV, but there’s still a sort of “raw edge” attraction here."
1453,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. 15 year old Trilogy, 40%<review>Here they take a triple distilled blend of pot still, malt, and grain whiskey matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry and finish it in golden rum casks (a favorite finishing vessel at Wm. Grant). A soft, relaxing sweetness emits from the glass, showing barley sugars, lemon bonbon, vanilla, and freshly-planed oak. The oloroso has been used sparingly, but rounds off the lemon, light fudge, and hazelnut flavors. There’s a spicy last stand that burns brightly. A terrific composition."
1454,"<price>190<rating>83<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Longmorn) 18 year old, 51.6%<review>Oak-driven, with cream and butterscotch dominating the nose initially. Then there’s black cherry, and coriander seed frying in butter. The weighty distillate adds depth, but not specific flavors. The palate is all coconut cream, cream toffee, then Longmorn’s cooked plum density comes in. I’d have preferred the oak to be scaled back, allowing the distillate to show, but if you’re looking for a scotch made for bourbon lovers, then go no further."
1455,"<price>117<rating>80<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Girvan) 21 year old 1993, 51.8%<review>Unmistakably grainy in character, this offers aromas of pink lemonade Dubble Bubble, faint vanilla, confectioner’s sugar, and mild herbal tones. Its redeeming qualities are the good thick texture and creamy, buttery feeling in the mouth. Sparkling orange and processed raspberry and strawberry flavors are hit by a surge of pepper and clove, which subsides to allow some late herbal notes to creep in. The finish has a heavy clove note. File this as a grain enthusiast’s grain whisky. £81"
1456,"<price>349<rating>90<whiskey>Talisker 30 year old, 57.3%<review>For me, Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 
As with many of these older whiskies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.
The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer. "
1457,"<price>95<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Premier Barrel (distilled at Glengoyne) 7 year old, 46%<review>Another youthful offering from Douglas Laing in its Premier Barrel series, presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters. This Glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt. Tangy fruits on the palate, malt, and spicy sausage. Caramel, spices, and a hint of oak in the finish. An interesting contrast to the older, more sherry cask-focused Glengoyne ‘house’ bottlings. £65"
1458,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Bernheim Original Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Wheat, 45%<review>This is a rare single barrel, non-chill filtered release. Straight wheat whiskeys can be almost too easy-going. Not chill-filtering adds teasing, subtle complexity. Gently sweet, with maple syrup, caramel, marzipan, and coconut cream, along with a dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and green tea. A whiskey for a lazy Saturday afternoon...or perhaps with pancakes at brunch? (Julio’s Liquors exclusive)"
1459,"<price>94<rating>84<whiskey>Sullivans Cove Double Cask, 40%<review>This verdant Tasmanian whisky is the combined product of American oak and French oak port cask aging. You get waxy palm fronds, hazelnut shells, toasted spices, and celery tops laid over a groveside box wedged full of freshly-picked Florida oranges.Soft, honeyed, and gently spicy on the palate before the herbal and botanical notes overgrow it, leaving clove, pepper, and aniseed balls on the finish. Water cuts through the greenery to show lemon meringue pie with a grapefruit edge."
1460,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>MacPhail’s Collection (distilled at Glenturret) 2000, 43%<review>This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon & MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak."
1461,"<price>22<rating>77<whiskey>Finger Lakes Glen Thunder Corn Whiskey, 45%<review>Crisps the nose hairs a bit, but it’s pure corn, even a bit of cornbread. Tip a sip in, and it’s nothing but more green corn, sweet, fresh — hot, for sure, but not overwhelming — and pretty tasty for what it is. With white whiskey, we’re walking the fine line between flavor and raw wound at all times, and this one finds the line."
1462,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Eifel German Rye (2019 Edition), 46%<review>This is a colossal rye, the result of 2 years in first-fill and refill red wine barrels, and 2 years in malaga casks. The nose suggests a thick, velvety dram of dark rye bread, cinnamon, nutmeg, rosemary, prune juice, sultana, and pecan pie, with herbal undertones. On the palate there is dark smooth toffee, stewed plum, bramble, and spun sugar stalked by ginger, pepper, and cinnamon. Oh, the Manhattans you will make. (2,400 bottles)"
1463,"<price>109<rating>94<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Malmsey Madeira Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Batch No. AH08), 59.45%<review>A sweet and enticing nose of marzipan, crème anglaise, blueberry compote, cooked
cherry, brown sugar, baking spice, and vanilla bean. The palate showcases rich
chocolate, with heaps of dark and cooked fruit: blackberry and blueberry preserves,
Luxardo cherries, as well as cinnamon, dried ginger, allspice, and roasted
walnuts—everything seamlessly interwoven. Lengthy on the finish, with mocha, dark
chocolate, polished oak, and white pepper."
1464,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke, 46%<review>The power of pure burning peat smoke, lemon-scented floor polish, pine needles, salt spray, and delicate vanilla places this squarely among the archetypal whiskies from Islay. Sweet lemon, custard cream biscuits, and hints of smoked goose lend an oily mouthfeel. A combustible climax of smoke, spice, and earthy peat kindle a red-hot finish that will have you puffing smoke like a chimney."
1465,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey> Big Peat Christmas Edition 2017, 54.1%<review>Big Peat looks incredibly pale in the glass this year, but his message is undiminished. Antiseptic, pine-scented floor cleaner, and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. Sugary sweet, with lemon lozenges, light vanilla, caramel, and dark toffee, while a bowling, somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth. Hot, dry finish, like gargling with hot coals. Merry Peatmas everybody."
1466,"<price>85<rating>89<whiskey>Amrut Kadhambam, 50%<review>Proof, if it were still needed, that Amrut intends to cement its position as the leading innovator in world whisky. Kadhambam is the sweetest of Amruts, as a result of a complex maturation process that has seen peated Amrut matured in local brandy and rum casks. There's a liqueur-like edge to it as a result, but it's a complex malt, with cherry blossom, peppercorn, and apple peel in the mix. Not the distillery's best, but very, very drinkable."
1467,"<price>45<rating>91<whiskey>Teeling Single Grain, 46%<review>Soft berry fruits and roasted spices, draped in the wine flavors of the California Cabernet Sauvignon barrique. The flavors start softly, with rhubarb, apple, blackberry fruit, and Brazil nut before a spice steamroller rattles through, jettisoning licorice and star anise over cooked fruits. The reverberations of the spices continue through a dry finish. With the grain as a canvas, the wine’s colors work particularly well here."
1468,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Westward Oregon Straight Malt Whiskey, 45%<review>All-malt, double pot-distilled, aged 2 years in new, charred, 53 gallon oak barrels. Nose has cereal and muted apple notes, some light grassiness, youthful. Exciting on the palate: hard candy, vanilla, oaky spice, hints of maple; it’s a jubilance that doesn’t end, but doesn’t get tiresome like some sugar-high toddler either. Finish is just more of the same, which is okay, but mildly disappointing. Well done, but quite pricey. Price is per 375ml."
1469,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Stagg Jr., 67.2%<review>The new, younger sibling to George T. Stagg. George T.’s signature is its bold nature and high proof, and Junior follows in its footsteps. The aromas are very nice: bold spice (clove, dusty mint, cinnamon, evergreen) with layers of burnt sugars, cocoa, charred oak, and berried fruit. However, on the palate, those sugars become dominated by aggressive spice, leather, and unnecessary tannin, most notably on the finish. Spend a little more and opt for George T. Stagg instead."
1470,"<price>47<rating>91<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Old Fashioned Sour Mash (125 Entry Proof), 45%<review>Darker in both flavor and personality when compared to its sibling. Rich palate-coating caramel and toffee provide the foundation for roasted nuts, dark berry fruit, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and polished leather. Long, satisfying finish. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbons 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml."
1471,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Lambay Single Malt, 40%<review>Spicier and darker than their blend, this delivers heather honey, banana peel, cashew, pepper, ground coriander, and bay leaf. Quite light-bodied and delicate to begin with, but the Cognac cask adds fruitiness and greater complexity. Sugary sweet, with tingly spices, honey, cracked black pepper, clove-studded oranges, and tangy marmalade. A finish of bitter orange, pepper, and fondant cream makes this a worthy addition to the Cognac cask revival."
1472,"<price>550<rating>90<whiskey>Ardbeg Twenty Something 22 year old, 46.4%<review>Distilled in the spring of 1996, this was matured in bourbon barrels and yields a nose of exotic spices, heather in bloom, soft aromatic peat, and grapefruit sprinkled with iodine. Well-mannered peat, brine, orange peel, vanilla, and black pepper on the palate. The finish is long, smoky, and peppery."
1473,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Ohishi Kaito’s Cask, 41.8%<review>Spicy rice crackers, plum sauce, bramble jelly, fragrant oriental spices, and the polished leather of new shoes from this single cask, sherry-matured rice whisky. The syrupy texture bursts with juicy red fruits, plum, red currant, pomegranate, and cooked peach, all bolstered by peppercorns and ground ginger. An enchanting harmony is struck between the fruits and the spice, though the finish is short, with sherry notes and spicy remnants. (660 bottles)"
1474,"<price>84<rating>83<whiskey>Bn6 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bunnahabhain), 56.9%<review>Very chewy. Think of melting Mars bars, with a touch of coconut cream, then red-fruit acidity, red cherry, and lemon. All very forward and sweet, but with no alcohol when neat, showing an active cask. Dilute, there’s coconut, pea shoots, and banoffie pie. The palate is thick with Jaffa cake (orange and chocolate), then nutty granola. It doesn’t take water too well. Quite fat. £50/500 ml"
1475,"<price>780<rating>88<whiskey>Tomatin 36 year old, 46%<review>Tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression, and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. Matured in a combination of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, this expression has not been chill-filtered. Milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose, with background apricots, malt, and ginger. Ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. Good mouth-feel, lively sweet fruits, cloves, and more ginger on the palate. Long in the finish, drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate."
1476,"<price>1872<rating>85<whiskey>The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1985 30 year old (Cask #612), 54.1%<review>Here, the distillery character is more restrained, as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. There’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes, showing a gentle maturation. It’s one I kept going back to; teasing, slightly elusive, but rewarding. £1,300"
1477,"<price>109<rating>81<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 21 year old, 50.9%<review>Did you hear that this distillery produced its 2.5 billionth liter of alcohol in 2015? This example from a refill hoggie has a floral bouquet, with a nose of snapped fingers of vanilla shortbread, butter frosting, and Angel Delight. An oily texture with flavors reminiscent of popcorn, turns to caramel, vanilla, parkin, and gingersnaps. There are some growling base notes of peppercorn, but it ends on a singed popcorn note. Sticky nougat and toasted corn chips on the finish. (294 bottles) £76"
1478,"<price>35<rating>91<whiskey>High West Double Rye! (Batch #18A23), 46%<review>A beautiful rye nose of clove spice, sandalwood incense, warm cinnamon toast, and vanilla sugar leads to a palate that is both creamy and juicy, with abundant apricot, orchard, and citrus fruit; the citrus smacks of ruby-red grapefruit with its hint of bitterness. Shows a good bit of heat and power, as the seamless flavors and well-integrated spice coast through a long finish. The first bottling to include High West’s own-make spirit. Tasted blind against previous batches."
1479,"<price>56<rating>82<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Fettercairn) 2003, 45%<review>An 11 year old Fettercairn from Douglas Laing, this is an undemanding but pleasing Highland dram. It comes from a distillery which tends to polarize opinion among drinkers. The nose is light and crisp, slightly floral, with pear juice and a hint of honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and drinking chocolate. Powdery in the finish, with tangerines and a suggestion of Parma violets. £37"
1480,"<price>49<rating>84<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 25 year old, 49.8%<review>More typical grain whisky territory here, with a nose of cornflakes, fresh cream, cut grass, filaments of orange peel, and a curiously dull pepper note. Spice, sweetness, and citrus fight for dominance. Spice wins with a K.O. on sweetness and lays the citrus out cold on the canvas. Creamy chocolate notes tarnished with hot pepper on the finish, though coffee-pot flavors emerge with a dash of water."
1481,"<price>28<rating>82<whiskey>Canadian Club Sherry Cask, 41.3% ABV<review>8 years old and sherry finished, and it shows in the darker color. Sweet dark fruit aromas; a bit sugary. Waxy fruit and caramel, wood spice, and some oaky prickliness on center tongue as the whisky fades. More interesting than the standard, but a bit thick.  "
1482,"<price>265<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach Temporis 21 year old, 46%<review>Temporis is a peated variant of BenRiach, and like its unpeated 21 year old stablemate it was matured in a mix of four types of barrels: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and oloroso sherry. Sweet leather and peat on the nose; emerging vanilla and woodsmoke. Quite muscular on the palate, where orchard fruits are balanced by drying oak. White pepper and aniseed in the relatively long finish."
1483,"<price>225<rating>83<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Banff), Cask #3421, 30 year old, 1975 vintage, 43.5%<review>Very fruity and spicy. High, bright fruit notes of lemon, mandarin, and mango, with a sprinkling of ginger and powdered vanilla. Oak kicks in on the end, leading to a fairly dry finish, which is not surprising for a 30 year old whisky. 
"
1484,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Deerhammer Port Cask-Finished American Single Malt (Batch 1), 50%<review>An herbaceous and savory whiskey, with an expressive nose: fennel, licorice, roasted lemon and clementine peels, new leather, and dark berries. The finish makes itself evident from first sip, with a chewy texture and flavors of dark chocolate, nocino liqueur, black licorice, orange oil, and allspice. The finish has good length, with more dark chocolate, fennel, roasted nuts, polished oak, and pipe tobacco."
1485,"<price>235<rating>82<whiskey>Overeem Port Cask Matured #26, 43%<review>A soft wadding of port gently prods the senses, producing a nose like a tincture from the hedgerows: redcurrant, raspberry, hawthorn, elderberry, and fresh, grassy notes with an accompaniment of waxed thornproof jackets, star anise, cardamom, and muted cloves. After maturation in 100-liter French oak quarter casks, the mouthfeel is thinner than expected. It’s like sinking your teeth into a slice of watermelon. There’s raspberry, Kola Kubes, and a touch of bitterness before a sticky finish. £140"
1486,"<price>34<rating>86<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 1995 vintage, 40%<review>The newest vintage from Knappogue Castle and, like the past two vintages, this one is from Bushmills. More maturity and oak influence when compared to the 1994. Floral, with creamy vanilla, toasted oak, honeyed malt, citrus fruit, and marshmallow. Soft, creamy finish with delicate oak spice. A clean, very drinkable whiskey, and my favorite of the post-Cooley Knappogues.
"
1487,"<price>53<rating>92<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch No. 2 Bourbon Cask and Rye Finish, 40%<review>Try this in your next Manhattan. Heather honey sweetness, Belgian waffles, cinnamon, rye spices, creamy vanilla, peppercorn, and dried porcini emerge after the 6-month rye cask finishing period. Sweet caramel oozes over the tongue, Highland toffee and Orkney fudge hold the spices in check. Banana candy and deep citrus acknowledge the Dufftown single malt component. The most accomplished Blender’s Batch to date. Emma Walker has nailed it. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
1488,"<price>180<rating>86<whiskey>Highland Park 24 year old 1981 Vintage (Cask #3252), 45.3%<review>A lush Highland Park, aged in a sherry cask. Ripe fruit (sultana, apricot, dark cherry pits), layers of sweetness (toffee, nougat, molasses) almonds, and juicy oak. Hints of vanilla cream, honey, heather and polished leather add dimension. This sherry contribution is clean, not overly sappy or waxy like others I have tasted. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)"
1489,"<price>125<rating>87<whiskey>Westland Garryana Single Malt (2016 edition), 56.2%<review>This holds real promise for the scotch lover. Interesting vanillin oak, peaty phenols, and adhesive bandage balance the generous, sweet malt foundation. Robust on the palate, but far from fiery, the mouth coating peat takes charge of the marshmallow-sweet malt, before dusty cocoa and dark chocolate win out across the long finish. Like other Westland efforts, this tries hard on many fronts and succeeds on some. It’s hard to deduce what the Oregon Quercus Garryana oak actually brings to the whole."
1490,"<price>40<rating>94<whiskey>Lot No. 40 2012 Release, 43%<review>Distilled from 90% rye grain and 10% rye malt, Lot No. 40 boldly mingles the galvanizing piquancy of distilled rye grain with the soaring floral fragrance of malted rye, and a fruitiness born of age. It begins with hard, dusty, earthy rye, and sour rye bread, followed by a trio of baking spices: cloves, nutmeg, and blistering ginger. A farm-tinged sourness fades into citrus fruit with velvet tannins. (Canada only)C$40"
1491,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #1, 45%<review>Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Soft and sweet, oozing caramel, honeyed vanilla, and gentle, ripe orchard fruit. Soft, gently sweet finish. Not the most complex of the three in this experiment, but it’s very easy-going and soothing on the palate. A nice pairing for a cigar, where the sweet notes will marry nicely with the cigar’s dried spice. Price is per 375 ml."
1492,"<price>406<rating>88<whiskey>Cardhu, 1997 vintage, 57.3%<review>Matured in a bourbon cask. Cardhu has always been a pleasant, but uninspiring, whisky to me. This is one of the best Cardhu whiskies I’ve tasted -- richer and more distinctive. (At this price, it had better be!) It’s clean and tight, with orange, tangerine, lemon gumdrops, ginger, delicate honey, butterscotch, and vanilla, with a dusting of powdered sugar. Straightforward, pleasing finish. (252 bottles)  £250"
1493,"<price>11824<rating>94<whiskey>Brora 40 year old Single Cask 1972 Vintage, 59.1%<review>Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. The finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7,000"
1494,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Dun Beghan Magilligan Irish Whiskey, 14 year old, 1992 vintage, 46%<review>Finished in a rum cask. Very creamy, with a soothing sweetness. Notes of vanilla, demerara sugar, nougat, and subtle tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, mango) coat the palate. All this is balanced nicely by resinous oak and a peppering of dried spices that linger on the finish. The rum finish, along with the 46% bottling strength, adds backbone and flair. One of the best whiskeys to come out of Cooley. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) 
"
1495,"<price>38<rating>88<whiskey>Compass Box Asyla, 43%<review>Gold color. Floral aromas balanced with a gentle vanilla sweetness, and soft fruit. Soft, rounded body. The palate delivers what the aroma promises in a very clean and balanced way. Pleasing finish. 
"
1496,"<price>21<rating>82<whiskey>Paddleford Creek Small Batch, 41.5%<review>No age statement, “charcoal filtered.” Hard candy/sweet-spicy nose with some wood edginess, stewed corn, and mineral notes; not particularly well-integrated. The thin body flashes vanilla and light caramel across the tongue as some hot oak fires things up. On the lean side, and like most such bourbons, the finish lingers, and flares at each swallow: oak, cinnamon, and that same mineral note. Not bad, but it needs more. Sourced whiskey."
1497,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Bellevoye Black, 43%<review>A good hit of woodsmoke, some coastal character, black cherry, and ground black pepper, but there is a sulfurous note with a hint of rubber gloves. The perfectly placid palate of citrus and caramel is disrupted by an angry swarm of pepper, which eventually dies away, leaving behind more smoke and hints of hazelnut. A mouth-watering finish of orange candy and pepper."
1498,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Kilchoman (Summer 2010 Release), 46%<review>This young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry, to be honest. I think it softened the whisky, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal."
1499,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Linkwood) 1973, 46%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Honey gold Aroma: Subtly complex. Floral (especially roses). Honeyed vanilla sweetness. Subtle notes of bourbon and bakers chocolate. Murray McDavid (distilled at Linkwood, 1973, 46%) cont. Palate: Nicely balanced and with great depth. Again the honey and vanilla, which marries beautifully with the floral, herbal, subtly fruity notes. Almonds and dried spice on the finish. 
"
1500,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch B517), 62.1% <review>As bourbon matures in new charred oak barrels over time, it approaches a perilous point when the oak dominates the flavor. To sip Elijah Craig at 12 years of age—at full barrel proof, without dilution or filtering—is to taste bourbon at its apex, so dangerously close to going over the crest of the hill, yet delivering a massive mouthful of incredibly robust flavors that drape leathery oak over a gooey caramel core, sprinkled with baking spice, while candied nuts and tobacco leaf notes appear on a drying finish dusted with cocoa. Number 1 in the 2017 Top 20 "
1501,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 'Connoisseurs Choice' (distilled at Caol Ila), 13 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%<review>An interesting contrast to the Signatory bottling reviewed above. While expressing a similar fundamental flavor profile, this one is a more polished affair and not as daring. It is fuller in body, nicely rounded, and expresses a sweeter foundation (less honey, more toffee and caramel). 
"
1502,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select, 45.2%<review>The same mashbill as its sister brand Old Forester, Woodford Reserve is an unknown combination from Brown-Forman’s Louisville and Versailles distilleries. There’s no age statement, but Woodford is around 7 years old. The key here is balance. One note never overtakes the other; nutmeg, mango, baked apples, cinnamon, blueberry pie, and vanilla seem to walk in perfect harmony. Then we find the gingerbread, caramel, and vanilla jumping into layers of smoke and spice."
1503,"<price>107<rating>83<whiskey>Southern Coast Single Malt Cask 3, 46%<review>What a difference a cask makes, say Southern Distillers, and they're not kidding. Just five casks have been made available so far, each one hand-crafted in traditional fashion by people who know what they're doing, and each one pushing out the envelope. This is the nuttiest and dustiest of the five and it wears its youth on its sleeve, but there are no feints and the whisky marks a step up in quality, with date, walnut, and golden syrup in the mix. A$110"
1504,"<price>43<rating>87<whiskey>Redwood Empire Emerald Giant Rye, 45%<review>Showcasing the sweeter side of rye, this has tropical aromas of papaya, guava, kiwi, and melon, along with candied oranges, Craisins, and aromatic spices: cassia, cardamom, sandalwood. The palate is sweet and spiced, with pineapple, blueberry jam, bananas, Fruit Stripes gum, and orange Creamsicle, finishing with chili pepper, dry oak, and a hint of flowers. A combination of 3 to 5 year old ryes made at Graton Distilling Co. and MGP Distillery. (54,000 bottles)"
1505,"<price>46<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Garioch 1797 Founder’s Reserve, 48%<review>The entry level, no age statement expression of Glen Garioch, offered at an unusually high ABV for a single malt in this price range.  Grapefruit , lively spice, vanilla, malt, and black pepper on the nose. Milk chocolate, chili, cooking apples, and something slightly savory on the palate. Citrus fruits and lots of spice in the relatively lengthy finish. An unusual and pleasing dram for the money. £32"
1506,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>The Busker Single Grain, 44.3%<review>
Very light whiskey, with lemon, honey, dried pear slices, ground ginger, and cracked black peppercorn. Matured in marsala casks and bourbon barrels, it’s light-bodied with lemon, lime zest, cream, and vanilla, and slowly adds toffee, spice, and a touch of red fruits before golden syrup and spice run through the finish. Works better on the rocks and in Highballs than as a neat sipper."
1507,"<price>18<rating>85<whiskey>Douhans, 40%<review>Coconut cream, orange peel, vanilla, and plenty of sweet grain permeate the nose and carry through to the palate, which is uncomplicated and youthful; a creamy, floral, banana confection touched with lemon. Light and simple—if you like this style of whiskey, this is a good option. (Walmart)"
1508,"<price>105<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan Edition No. 2, 48.2%<review>This limited release was aged in seven cask types—both American and European oak in a variety of sizes—from four Spanish bodegas: Vasyma, Diego Martin, Jose Miguel Martin, and Tevasa. Citrus fruits, ginger, black pepper, light smoke, and rubbery leather on the nose. Ultimately, carnations. The palate is rich, nutty, and sweet, with malt, toffee, sticky sherry, maraschino cherries, milk chocolate, and gentle spice. Long in the finish, with spices and creamy cocoa."
1509,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Single Cask #12274 (distilled at Ardmore) 1990 Vintage, 56.4% ABV<review>Ardmore whiskies I’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. Many have also been recognizably smoky, which is rare for a Speyside whisky. This one, aged in a first fill bourbon barrel, is true to its roots. It is a clean whisky, with a creamy, soothing maltiness throughout. The palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey, with anise, white pepper and a teasing smokiness. The thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. A very underrated whisky. 
"
1510,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Hellyers Road Original, 40%<review>Creamy lemon truffles, cereal notes, vanilla sponge, dry oak, with peppered steak seasoning. Creamy, sweet, buttery, soft honeydew melon, peach notes, and orange zest, with a soft late spiciness, though the impression is much more tame than the nose suggests. Buttery, mouth-coating finish with gentle spices on the core whisky from this Tasmanian distillery."
1511,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof Rye 8 year old, 61.1%<review>Think of an herb garden. It’s pronounced with herbs such as parsley, dill, and hints of basil and mint. Fruits develop (canned peaches and pears), followed by earth, floral, and oak. Then a medicinal note sets in, forming as cherry cough syrup, striking an unbalanced, astringent mouthfeel with hints of mint and salted chocolate. A drop of water softens the medicinal approach and returns the herbal, fruity, and earthy richness. Finishes medium with a hint of dill."
1512,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Kornog Sant Ivy 2018, 59.7%<review>The subtle sweet smoke, like singed rocks around a beach fire, becomes more pungent if left unattended. Underneath, aromas of sweet lemons, tropical fruits, lemongrass, and smoked olives abound. Juicy sweetness, with a real concentration of mango, papaya, and sugary boiled candies melds into flavors of vanilla and Battenberg cake. After a concluding rush of pepper, the smoky fumes permeate through the back end. Oh boy! Ridiculously good! €115"
1513,"<price>39<rating>83<whiskey>The Famous Jubilee, 40%<review>A tribute this time from Edrington Group in the form of this one-off blend of The Famous Grouse. The sherried element seems to have been upped as it shows lavish amounts of dark chocolate, black cherry, and a little treacle, with some orange peel and, with water, raspberry and heather.  The palate shows a hint of smoke and builds through rich flavors to a toffee-accented finish. Subtle and long. £25"
1514,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory), 57.6%<review>Bottled at 8 years of age as part of Exclusive Malts’ U.S. Batch 5, this is a relatively youthful expression of the peated Ledaig spirit produced at Tobermory distillery. The nose is full-on and vibrant, with seaweed, brine, peat, black pepper, and new leather. The palate opens with a big punch of spicy peat, then sweet cereal notes and more black pepper. Hot smoke and spice in the medium-length finish, with a hint of coal."
1515,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Cardhu Gold Reserve, 40%<review>Representing House Targaryen, this features its three-headed dragon on the label.

1516,"<price>32<rating>89<whiskey>Dewar's Special Reserve 12 year old, 43%<review>Gold-amber color. Toffee, fruit, and a wisp of smoke underpin floral aromas. On the palate, flavors are nicely balanced and harmoniously interwoven. Gently sweet toffee notes up front gradually yield to drier notes on the finish, with soft, delicate fruit flavors throughout."
1517,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Signatory 13 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1993 vintage, 53.2%<review>A nicely balanced Laphroaig, with a soothing malty sweetness layered in between the smoke, peat, tarry rope, and iodine. Underlying notes of vanilla bean, caramel custard, grist, anise, coconut, blueberry, and a dusting of cocoa add subtle complexity."
1518,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Deanston 12 year old, 46.3%<review>This non-chill filtered, higher-strength Deanston 12 year old replaced its ‘standard’ predecessor in 2009. It offers a nose of orange marmalade, shortbread dipped in honey, ginger, cinnamon, and vanilla. Salted caramel, milk chocolate, hazelnuts, fudge, and sweet oak on the soft palate. The finish is medium in length, with peppery oak."
1519,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>Metze’s Select, 46.5%<review>Old school spicy nose, almost archetypal scents of sweet teaberry, cinnamon, and spearmint hard candy, with a firm, warm alcohol backing. True in the mouth: I’m tasting just what I smelled, all on a full bed of corn sweetness, floating off into a warm finish. Could it be more complex? Yes, but it’s beautifully balanced, and not the over-oaked shellac that passes for mature bourbon these days. If this was under $30 a bottle, I’d marry it. (6,000 bottles)"
1520,"<price>98<rating>83<whiskey>House of Hazelwood 21 year old, 40%<review>A spicier character to represent 1920s Bombay (now Mumbai) yields an intriguing nose of cumin, dried apple, cardamom, and roasted coriander seed, walnut shells, dry meat from the tandoor, and aged cigars in Spanish cedar. A rather gluey texture with a dominant cinnamon note, interjected by spicy fruit from the European oak and gentle cloves. A short finish leaves a reverberation of spices and chicory root. The aromas are wonderful, but it comes unstuck with the mouthfeel. £75"
1521,"<price>115<rating>83<whiskey>Usquaebach Old Rare Stone Flagon, 43%<review>Hunter Laing blended this grand Highland whisky: an 85% malt-driven recipe of more mature stock. I liked its aromas of dripping caramels, dry peats, soft hay, and faint pepper balancing the resilient smoky character. There’s the juiciness of mandarin oranges, too. The blend is smooth and well-textured, beginning with sugared orange, malt, vanilla, and toasted spices which glide into clove and black pepper. The drying finish has spicy pepper, ground ginger, and lasting citrus."
1522,"<price>48<rating>81<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates Stout Edition, 40%<review>Cork’s Franciscan Well brewery borrowed some whiskey casks, but now Jameson has taken them back to make Irish whiskey aged in craft stout barrels. On the nose, roasted coffee beans, 70% chocolate, green apples, juicy cantaloupe, and a buzz of hops. The thick, creamy mouthfeel tastes of stout, with strong chocolate and coffee notes and a tight, spicy finish. Perplexingly experimental in results. A whiskey for stout drinkers? A stout for whiskey drinkers? Incomparable to other Jameson. Funny peculiar. €45"
1523,"<price>2750<rating>85<whiskey>The Macallan Masters of Photography 1996 (Release 3, Cask #10019), 55.5%<review>Light amber. A very clean, mealy, and creamy nose with real sweetness and a belt of vanilla before things settle into the realm of cooked fruits enlivened by masses of peppermint. The oak shows itself as hot sawdust and a little cedar. In the mouth, that sweetness continues to alternate between a prickly feel and sweet fruit syrups, while Macallan’s oily earthiness anchors it both on the tongue and to the distillery. 285 bottles."
1524,"<price>2750<rating>91<whiskey>The Macallan Masters of Photography 1989 (Release 3, Cask #12251), 56.6%<review>Dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. Lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. Wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. Sherry-soaked oak, dry leaves, currants, and ripe blackberry. Highly concentrated, but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. There’s a hint of smoke and Seville orange bitterness on the finish. My pick of the quartet. Excellent. 285 bottles."
1525,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey> Laws Whiskey House 4 year old Centennial Bottled in Bond Wheat Whiskey, 50%<review>Billed as one of the first bottled in bond wheat whiskeys, its nose starts pleasantly oily and tart, leading to notes of green tea, sassafras, licorice, and leather. The palate is grain-forward, offering spice, raspberry jam, sweet orange, and black pepper. A finish of chocolate, baking spice, and honey is balanced by light bitterness. A restrained but expressive wheater, with lots of character and flavors that linger. Opens up beautifully with water. (600 bottles)"
1526,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>St. George Single Malt (Lot 18), 43%<review>Plummy, earthy, and zingy with grapefruit and pine aromas, along with orange marmalade, raspberry, and hazelnut. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth, it has flavors of lemon cake, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and intense floral and fruity hops, as well as sweet plum and mocha notes. This whiskey’s beauty is in its delicate balance, although it may veer too far out of the middle lane for conventional palates."
1527,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Woody Creek Straight Rye, 45%<review>An enjoyable 2 year old from Colorado, the sweet stone fruit nose, laced with mint and herb garden, betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary. Still a touch hot and lacking some intensity, but pleasing clover honey sweetness on the palate and long, warming spice with a cocoa finish bode very well for the future."
1528,"<price>40<rating>89<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof 12 year old, 67.1%<review>Quite dark in color, turning cloudy with water. Don’t let that deter you. A thick, chewy bourbon, with layers of nutty toffee,
nougat, cocoa, and toasted marshmallow, peppered with cinnamon and vanilla. Oak and leather on the finish dry out the whiskey nicely. Not the most refined bourbon, but the flavors it delivers make up for it."
1529,"<price>53<rating>83<whiskey>Glenkeir Treasures (Ledaig, distilled at Tobermory) 9 year old, 40%<review>Distilled in February 2005. Earthy peat, brine, vanilla, cereal, and a hint of cinnamon on the confident nose. Finally, wood smoke. Lively in the mouth, with nutty spices and pipe tobacco, while peat briefly takes a back seat before reasserting itself. Ginger and peat embers in the medium-length finish. (Whisky Shop only) £35/500 ml"
1530,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>Barrell 25 year old Cask-Strength American Whiskey, 55.6%<review>Some whiskeys have already peaked at a quarter-century, but this one, distilled in Indiana and finished in sercial madeira casks, is at its apex. Caramel-covered peanuts, candied orange, fresh-baked bread, Toblerone, cinnamon ginger snaps, blueberry cobbler, black tea, and plenty of oak on the nose. The palate is supple and elegant, with peanut brittle, cherry cordial, milk chocolate, blueberry, horehound candy, cola, white pepper, ginger, roasted pecans, and refined oak. Leave plenty of time to enjoy the finish, with its subtle white pepper and dark fruit undertones."
1531,"<price>35<rating>78<whiskey>Short Mountain Shine, 52.5%<review>Does this belong here, at 70% cane sugar and 30% corn/wheat? The process sure looks like whiskey, so we’ll let it slip in. The aroma’s sweet, but with a solvent rim to it. For 105 proof, this is pretty smooth stuff in the mouth. There are notes of melon and green corn, and a wet hint of fresh grass before the burner kicks on at the finish. It’s a hot end on this one, but not unpleasant. "
1532,"<price>36<rating>93<whiskey>George Dickel Bottled in Bond 13 year old (Distilled in Fall 2005) Tennessee Whiskey, 50%<review>There’s so much peanut in this whiskey, it’s like standing in a JIF factory—but there’s also cracked corn, mixed berries, Coca-Cola, and fresh apples on the nose, along with weathered oak boards, and, when water is added, floral perfume. Powerful dense oak and cooked cherries, berries, and pomegranate on the palate, as well as cherry Popsicle and a heaping scoop of peanuts. The lengthy finish is rich with leathery oak, baking spice, roasted peanuts, and dark chocolate-covered cherries."
1533,"<price>400<rating>87<whiskey>Mannochmore 25 year old, 53.4%<review>Along with Auchroisk, Mannochmore is one of Diageo’s well-kept secrets. This 1990 distillate was matured in first-fill American oak hogsheads and European oak butts. Oily orange notes on the nose, plus vanilla, brittle toffee, and honey. The palate is substantial, rich, and sweet, with figs, sultanas, banana, and more honey, plus developing cloves. Raisins and plain chocolate in the long, spicy finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling. (3,954 bottles)"
1534,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila) 1989, 43%<review>Pale gold color. Aromas and flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, lemon grass, olives, and green peppercorns. Medium bodied, and slightly oily in texture. Long, dry peat smoke finish. Caol Ila is an Islay dram that Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Bowmore fans must become acquainted with. Although distllery bottlings are not available here in the U.S., many independent bottlers offer it. This expression is young, vibrant, and exciting."
1535,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Glengoyne 12 year old, 57.2%<review>A new, cask-strength Glengoyne without chill-filtering. Both features put this whisky in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. That classic clean maltiness which Glengoyne is known for is certainly in this whisky. With the addition of some water, the whisky really opens up, becoming fragrant, fruity (cherry pits, apples), along with hints of anise and almonds. A nice effort from the new owners."
1536,"<price>53<rating>81<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenburgie) 7 year old, 46%<review>Pale straw. An upfront and quite aromatic nose with hints of a florist’s shop—stems and blooms—with an underpinning of malt. A little gawky perhaps, which water accentuates. The palate, when neat, is clean and mixes those flowers and some stewed apple. There’s a little green chili heat (even when diluted). A punchy little number. £36"
1537,"<price>135<rating>84<whiskey>Old Hobart Overeem Sherry Cask Matured, 43%<review>One of the challenges we face with new whisky is that it is evolving quickly, and while we understand that, it's hard to keep up. But the upside is we have shorter memories and that means life's easier for the likes of Old Hobart. A year ago this malt was two-dimensional, overly sweet, and definitely a work in progress. The change is remarkable. Now it's balanced, the sherry and sweetness are in order, and the sappiness has retreated. A$130"
1538,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box No Name, 48.9%<review>Peatheads, listen up! Yes, there’s pine needles, zested lemons, honey, sanded wood, nutmeg, and cinnamon within this Islay-dominated blend, but it’s the billowing peat smoke that makes this special. It reeks gloriously of stacked fish boxes and heavy braided ropes on the pier. The dark fruit, baked lemons, cherry, clove, and cooked plum face entanglement in a labyrinth of shadowy stygian smoke. You could get lost in here for hours. (15,000 bottles)"
1539,"<price>70<rating>81<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Highland Park) 12 year old 1992 Vintage, 58.1%<review>Medium-bodied but viscous in texture. Clearly aged in a bourbon cask-there's plenty of honeyed malt and vanilla throughout. Hints of bourbon even peek through occasionally, along with some subtle peat. Soft melon mid-palate yields to dried spice, sea salt, bitter chocolate and herbal notes on the finish. Fairly dry for a 12 year old-particularly on the finish. Best served as an aperitif."
1540,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Castan Vilanova Terrocita Single Cask Single Malt (No. 73), 43%<review>Distillerie Castan lies northeast of Toulouse, and makes this peated whisky, disgorged from a white wine cask. The nose has pear, apple pie, and vanilla and it’s quite intensely spicy with cinnamon, pepper, and eucalyptus. A superb flavor trajectory beginning with sweet lemon bonbons, baked apple, cinnamon, and pepper, then baked orange desserts, ending on a hint of smoke. Lime zest, spices, and mild smoke to finish. (1,000 bottles)"
1541,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Union Horse Rolling Standard Midwestern Four Grain, 46%<review>This amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon, part single malt, offering a nose of sweet dried fruits —raisin and apples—heaped with earthy, leathery oak. The palate is enjoyable for its crème caramel sweetness and drinkability, but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed, overwhelming the medium body. A serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price. Corn, malted barley, wheat, and rye."
1542,"<price>60<rating>83<whiskey>Wolfburn Single Malt, 46%<review>The first release from Wolfburn distillery is 3 years old. Matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak quarter casks previously used by an Islay distillery. The nose is soft and belies its youth, offering vanilla, lemon, ginger, and light smoke. The early palate is grassy. Sweeter fruit notes soon develop with more vanilla and ginger, plus white pepper. The finish is quite long and slightly smoky. Much to look forward to as this ages!"
1543,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Arran Pomerol Wine Cask Finish (Limited Edition), 50%<review>Stylish, sophisticated. Fresh, honeyed floral, green grapes, kiwi, plum, and currant jelly. Hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, gently sweet finish. Pleasing sweetness to go with the fruit."
1544,"<price>63<rating>92<whiskey>Drumshanbo Single Pot Still, 43%<review>

After decades of consolidation, Ireland is experiencing a craft whiskey renaissance. Founded in 2014, The Shed Distillery delivers the first whiskey from the western province of Connacht in over a century. Polished creamy sweetness and aromatic spices herald this striking dram, which has been triple-distilled and then matured in first-fill bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Aromas of caramel, brioche, satsuma, and dried apricot draw you in, ushering in a luscious palate of pear, apple, and freewheeling spices bolstered by dried citrus, lime, and toasted coconut. Number 14 in the 2020 Top 20"
1545,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Compass Box 'The Spice Tree', 46%<review>The second generation of The Spice Tree. (This new expression sports a much larger tree image on the front label.) While the first bottling used inner French oak staves to impart additional oak influence, this one uses French oak barrel heads. This new bottling is also bolder, displaying more oak -- there are more dried spice notes and it’s more viscous and clinging on the palate. (It’s also less elegant than the original bottling.) Notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, bramble, and red currant give way to oak resin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and subtle lemongrass. A tactile, somewhat resinous, polished leather finish wraps it up. A nice whisky, but I really enjoy the subtler, more elegant nature of the original bottling better."
1546,"<price>4500<rating>97<whiskey>Black Bowmore 42 year old 1964 vintage, 40.5%<review>What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate, this is a thick, viscous, whisky with notes of sticky toffee, earthy oak, fig cake, roasted nuts, fallen fruit, pancake batter, black cherry, ripe peach, dark chocolate-covered espresso bean, polished leather, tobacco, a hint of wild game, and lingering, leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!"
1547,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Clyde May’s Straight Bourbon, 46%<review>This is a non-chill filtered bottling. Initially, it’s perfume-centric with highly floral notes until a grain neutralizer sets in, with hints of caramel and vanilla. Cornbread, honey, and slight hints of pepper, herbs, and tobacco. Finishes short with a mouthful of lovely sweet corn pudding."
1548,"<price>152<rating>92<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 30 year old 1984, 49.4%<review>The nose is bathed in aromas of lime, bergamot, lychee, and fresh pineapple cores. This is delicate, refined, and complex, with touches of fragrant spices and a calming influence of oak. A web of citrus strands, barley sugar, and toffee is shot through by wood spices and surpassed by a delicious butterscotch flavor that continues into the finish.  Effortless, relaxed, and brilliant whisky, and quite frankly, I’m not sure you could find better 30 year old whisky at this price. £106"
1549,"<price>215<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Glenugie), Cask #5156, 22 year old, 1975 vintage, 58.0%<review>The only sherry cask-aged Rarest of the Rare whisky reviewed here. Rich thick cut marmalade, combined with chewy toffee, sultana, and nuts. The oak adds spice, balance, and complexity. This isn’t a one-trick (sherry) pony. There’s a lot going on here. Spicy, resinous finish. One of the best Glenugies I have tasted. 
"
1550,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Brenne 10 year old 2016 Release, 48%<review>Brenne has a fruity, vinous demeanor unlike anything else on the whisky market, and this year’s bottling deploys a greater use of Cognac barrels. Ripe honeydew melon, poached pear, strands of lemon and mandarin, and warm, creamed rice pudding. Mandarin segments in watermelon juice liberally sprinkled with pepper, then some fudge-like sweetness emerges, barbed with fennel. The French oak spices persist into the finish, heaping on the pepper and licorice."
1551,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2010, 50%<review>Quantities of Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties were grown on eight Islay family farms during 2009, and the following year this grain was distilled, then matured in bourbon and French wine casks. The nose offers ginger, melon, malt, sweet (lit) pipe tobacco, freshly baled straw, resin, vanilla, and spice. Chewy in the mouth; oily, with toffee spices and youthful oak notes. The finish features oysters with lemon squeezed over them."
1552,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Restless Spirits Gullytown Double Barrel Single Malt, 46%<review>This American single malt is aged in two separate bourbon barrels—one new and one used. A malty, earthy nose of slate is followed by notes of coriander and orange peel, as well as iced tea, ginger, and dark chocolate. The palate offers espresso, bitter orange, more chocolate, and grilled pineapple. A long, rich finish of orange, mocha, black pepper, and pipe tobacco. Rich, malty, and flavorful—some enjoyable sipping here."
1553,"<price>82<rating>80<whiskey>BenRiach Horizons 12 year old, 50%<review>Not satisfied with trying different levels of peating and cask types, the folks at BenRiach are also utilizing triple distillation. This expression has spent three years in oloroso sherry butts, although for me there’s more a mix of honey and cream, and light orchard fruits than any overt fruitcake. The palate is clean and fresh and lifted. Good energy. £50"
1554,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Green Label, 43%<review>Just as complex as Johnnie Walker Gold, but fuller and more richly textured. (Not surprising, given that there are no grain whiskies in Johnnie Walker Green.) This is one of the finer vatted malts on the market. Its flavors are well-integrated. You’ll find creamy toffee and nougat at its core, which is then layered with notes of vanilla, mint, fresh brine, and even a hint of mustard seed. Excitingly fresh and vibrant on the finish. A whisky for both the blend and single malt drinker. And at $55, it is also fairly valued for an all-malt whisky."
1555,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey> Dewar’s White Label, 40%<review>Honey, fudge, a little melon and white grape, dry roasted spices, and peppercorn, but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon, lemon, lime, and some grapefruit acidity, before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times, some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean, juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat."
1556,"<price>20<rating>80<whiskey>The Antiquary, 40%<review>This venerable blend has a nose of mandarin syrup cake, vanilla cream, and cut hay, with chopped cilantro and other herbal top notes. Sweet and fruity, though verging on tasting of artificial sweeteners at times, there are malt notes and a developing butteriness, with sweet mandarin notes and sponge cake. It all hangs on a light structure but it’s less smooth on the finish, with a scratch of wood smoke."
1557,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Heaven’s Door Double Barrel, 50%<review>The additional year of aging in new American oak is readily apparent in this blend of American whiskeys. Dry, toasty, charred oak takes the lead before cherry cough drop, cedar, clove, eucalyptus, and toasted nuts emerge. The red and blue fruits are met with a jolt of spice that will delight rye whiskey fans, before delivering earthy, leathery, tobacco leaf on the finish. Big in oak flavors, but not overdone."
1558,"<price>82<rating>81<whiskey>Duncan Taylor, Octave (distilled at Aultmore) 2008, 52.7%<review>The recent official release of Aultmore means that malt lovers are finally aware of the distillery’s intense grassy/perfumed character, and it is these characters which are prominent here, alongside a very light sherried note in the background. There appears to be real complexity on the nose for such a young example, but water shows this to be the influence of the octave cask, which unravels slightly when water is added. Have it neat, and enjoy it a lot. £54"
1559,"<price>26<rating>89<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. XO Caribbean Rum Cask Finish, 43%<review>Rum-finishing specialists William Grant & Sons add to Ireland’s league of existing rum-finished whiskeys. The lush tropical fruit complexity is abundant with mango, passion fruit, dried papaya, and green apple on the nose. Red apple flavors dominate with Demerara sugariness, dried strawberry, egg custard, and toffee chews, before drifting off into sweeter, fruitier territory. Short finish with a shot of sweet nutmeg."
1560,"<price>60<rating>79<whiskey>Dry Fly Straight Bourbon 101, 50.50%<review>Lots of char and burnt sugar on the nose, leading to some sweet fruit on the palate, with coffee and mocha on the finish. Vanilla cream candies are overwhelmed by a woodpile of oak, drying tannins, and heat that lack balance. Multiple tastings with consistent results."
1561,"<price>190<rating>93<whiskey>Three Chord 15 year old Whiskey Drummer Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 58.95%<review>On the nose, figs, nuts, and integrated spice mingle with caramel-swirl brownie and tobacco barn; candy apple and grape Kool-Aid emerge with water. The palate has nutty, sweet, savory, and spicy flavors in abundance: dark chocolate-covered mint, Cherry Coke, cinnamon, pepper, allspice, roasted pecans, maple syrup, and polished oak. It’s consistent into the finish, which has cinnamon, black pepper, mint, dark chocolate, and lengthy varnish. Seamless to the last and, for a whiskey this mature, no water is necessary. (2,500 bottles)"
1562,"<price>37<rating>91<whiskey>W.L. Weller 12 year old Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>The nose feels dense and richly layered as cedary oak and sandalwood incense take the lead, while a deeper dive reveals toasted walnuts, licorice, and cocoa. The palate serves up plenty of sweet butterscotch, juicy grapefruit, and shaved coconut, before drying oak tannins sweep in, delivering coffee and dark chocolate cake on the finish. A supple mouthfeel and long finish enhance the overall delicious impression made by this bourbon. Shows best at full proof. Best Value"
1563,"<price>53<rating>81<whiskey>Fettercairn Fasque, 42%<review>While its regular stablemate Fior contains a proportion of peated malt, Fasque is unpeated, and the best comparison is with the now-discontinued 12 year old ‘1824’ house bottling. The nose is fragrant, with sherry, cherries, and vanilla. Relatively full-bodied, with a rich, spicy palate, focusing on Jaffa oranges and dark chocolate. It dries quite quickly to black coffee and spicy licorice, which linger in the mouth, along with a note of toffee. £35"
1564,"<price>350<rating>91<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1509 (Batch #3), 52.2%<review>The third batch in this series comprises twelve sherry butts distilled between 1989 and 1992, eleven American oak hogsheads from 1989, and eight refill American oak butts distilled in 1992 and 1993. Rich sherry, honey, and malt notes on the nose, with figs and citrus peel. Silky on the palate, with Jaffa oranges, raisins, ginger, and plain chocolate. Licorice, sherry, and spicy oak in the very long finish. (8,850 bottles)"
1565,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Kilchoman USA Small Batch (No. 1), 48.5%<review>Lemon curd on shortbread and sweet, salty smoke hit the nose to start, followed by stone fruit, fresh pears, citrus, and peppermint candies. In the mouth, it's ashy and oily, with oyster shell and cigar; add a few drops of water and suddenly it bursts into Technicolor—blueberries, juicy dark fruits, spiced chocolate, and vivid peppery spice. Explosive on the finish, with powerful notes of bitter chocolate, cinnamon, espresso, and lingering ash. (1,260 bottles)"
1566,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace French Oak Barrel Aged, 45%<review>Deeper, darker, more intense than the Barrel Head Aged expression. Toffee, pit fruit, Earl Grey tea, cinnamon, pencil shavings, and tobacco lead to a tannic, gripping finish. The French oak influence is tangible. Price is per 375 ml."
1567,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Crown Royal Single Barrel Whisky, 51.5%<review>This jaunty, rye-forward whisky from a mash of 64% corn, 31.5% rye, and 4.5% barley malt was distilled in an arcane Coffey still and spent seven years in new oak barrels. Flavors vary remarkably among barrels making each of these single barrel bottlings unique. This one exudes sweet floral perfume, vanilla, oaky tannins, sweet and sour sauce, spices, and basket loads of tropical fruits, all centered on soft banana candy. A long spicy, velvet tannin finish. (U.S. only) "
1568,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), 8 year old, 1996 vintage, 58.1%<review>The Islay character is most evident in the younger whisky expressions, before the oak has tamed them. This whisky is a perfect example: an uninhibited, incredibly powerful Caol Ila, thumping out notes of tarry rope, damp peat, kippers, and seaweed. Background spices (salt, pepper, ginger) add intrigue, while a firm foundation of vanilla malt struggles to provide soothing comfort. Extreme Islay whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)

1569,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>J. Rieger & Co. Monogram Oloroso Bota (2020 Edition), 52.5%<review>
Form a line, sherry lovers: This blend of 10 year old corn and 5 and 11 year old ryes is driven by its finishing casks, like many single malt scotches. Though the nose is reticent and hints at the luxe flavors, the palate is a sherry bomb: brown sugar, semi-sweet chocolate, raisins, hazelnuts, nougat, and figs, with sprinklings of spice and subtle saline. Drying tannin and mouth-puckering saltiness on the finish, with raisins and chocolate. The sherry is the point here, but it integrates splendidly with the muscular whiskey. (1,887 bottles)"
1570,"<price>110<rating>88<whiskey>Glenfiddich 18 year old Small Batch Reserve, 40%<review>This was aged in a mixture of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, followed by a final spell of marrying in wooden tuns. Dried fruits, dark chocolate, figs, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate yields rich caramel and toffee-apple notes, plus ginger, cloves, and medium sherry. More dried fruits, cookies, and a sprinkling of allspice in the slightly smoky, medium to long finish."
1571,"<price>55<rating>82<whiskey>West Cork Barrel Proof, 62%<review>I loosen up my shoulders and crick my neck, first left, then right: this is strong whisky. Creamed coconut, a little fudge, hints of nutmeg, unpeeled bananas, and quite a young grain character on the nose. Powerful: West Cork firing on all six. Sweet charred wood, caramel, macadamia nuts, and cinnamon toffee emerge unscathed. Settles down obediently with water: cinnamon toast and tasty caramels. This can handle plenty of water, though ultimately, the flavors still arrive at the same destination. (4,800 bottles)"
1572,"<price>13<rating>82<whiskey>Canadian Club Premium, 40%<review>Oh! The glory of new wood. Even dialed back from 6 years old to 5 this version pushes Canadian Club’s entry level mixing whisky into sippin’ territory. The century-old formula is unchanged, but brand new oak emphasizes the rye grain while injecting soft oak caramels and crispy bright barrel notes into the familiar, peppery, overripe dark fruit of one of the world’s longest continuously produced whiskies. A long gingery finish touches on sweet grapefruit and chili peppers."
1573,"<price>55<rating>96<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy, 66.35%<review>Just what the category was missing -- a stellar, young, barrel-proof rye whiskey. Hugely spicy, with piercing mint, fiery cinnamon, vanilla, coconut, and fennel. Underlying notes of caramel, honey, and Seville orange provide some civility. It has more zing and richness than other young rye whiskeys, and it lacks the tired woodiness of the majority of the older rye expressions on the market. A clean, powerful, vibrant whisky that is a must for any rye enthusiast."
1574,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Glendalough Triple Barrel, 42%<review>Three is the magic number: bourbon, oloroso, and canteiro-seasoned madeira barrels bring forth an intense whiskey that radiates summer warmth with unctuous raisin sweetness, candied orange peel, honey, ground cumin, peppercorn, and toasted oak. Peppercorn and oak char follow fruity-sweet flavors of apple, cranberry, cherry, and sultana. This impressive grain whiskey is more assertively spicy than their malts, but displays even greater depth and character than Glendalough Double Barrel. €48"
1575,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Scapa, 14 year old, 40%<review>A pleasure to drink, just like the 12 year old version that preceded it. A foundation of honeyed malt, with background vanilla, subtle cocoa, faint bourbon, salt, and diffuse spice on the palate. Light to medium in body, but fairly viscous in texture. However, a coastal freshness cuts through the viscosity, keeping the whisky lively. Some of the freshness of the previous 12 year old distillery bottling is sacrificed in exchange for more depth and fullness. It is neither better nor worse for this, just different.

1576,"<price>92<rating>84<whiskey>Paul John Classic Select Cask, 55.2%<review>Sticky, spiced-coconut desserts, grapefruit, clove, allspice, and crispy bacon on the nose of this NAS whisky matured in bourbon casks. Sharp with lime, grapefruit, and lemon zest that settle down to green fruits, Jell-O, and dry spices. Do dilute, as water lets the spices leap from the glass, strips down the acidic attack, and accentuates the fresh apple and cinnamon. It doesn’t need much water, but it’s eminently better with a dash. £63"
1577,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Forty Creek Resolve, 43%<review>A rich, full nose interweaves red wine, canned pears, smidgens of barrel wood, and dark maple syrup into a plush Christmas cake palate. Weighty and mouth-filling amid unsweetened breakfast cereal and mild tannins, balanced by candied fruit, prunes, crisp apples, and dried pears and apricots. Glowing peppery heat moves to the middle of the tongue before a long, spicy, and pithy yet creamy finish."
1578,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>The Exceptional Grain, 43%<review>The debut release from Don Sutcliffe's Sutcliffe & Sons, this small-batch blend of grain whiskies comes from several different distilleries including Loch Lomond, North British, and a 30 year old whisky from Carsebridge. The blend is married in first-fill sherry casks, which brings bright fruit to a fairly light whisky with notes of blackberry, vanilla, honey, light oak, and iris. Quite good for a grain whisky blend, but falls just short of being exceptional. (U.S. only)"
1579,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Belle Meade 10 year old Sherry Cask Finish, 53.2%<review>Whoa...this sherry-finished bourbon offers an up front impression you don’t find in American whiskey: marzipan meets ground-up raw almonds sprinkled over pistachio gelato. Then caramel, nuanced cinnamon, delicate vanilla, and a slight hint of campfire smoke. It’s supremely complex, with the third layer being honey, dried apricot, dried pear, figs, and prunes over a sublime nuttiness and rich caramel. The finish lingers with salted-caramel cashew. If this is the future of barrel-finished American whiskey, let there be more. (Jack Rose Dining Saloon private selection)"
1580,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Balblair 1989, 43%<review>Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas, along with cooking apples, sultanas, nuts, and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits, and becomes increasingly chocolate-y, with distinct cocoa notes, when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth, with lasting lively spice and vanilla."
1581,"<price>28<rating>82<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Uprising, 40%<review>Malt whiskey with a mashbill similar to a craft-brewed stout—think dark roasted malts—and then aged in new charred oak with an addition of toasted French oak. The nose is sweet young malt touched with chocolate. There’s an additional hit of cocoa at first taste, then heat, oak, vanilla, and more sweet malt, followed by a finish that’s increasingly chocolatey and dry. Young, and could use more complexity and maturing, but full of good flavors. Price is per 375 ml."
1582,"<price>30<rating>93<whiskey>Elijah Craig Kentucky Straight Rye, 47%<review>A welcome addition to the Elijah Craig family, this rye has rock-solid heft and flavor that doesn’t quit. The nose swells with cooked blackberries and raspberries, fruit leather, iced tea, cola, and stately oak. It’s chewy and viscous on the palate, with more berries and grapes (often jammy), well-integrated oak, dark chocolate, and lush spice. The finish rides a long way on peppery dark fruit, wet walnuts, dark chocolate, and rich oak. Editors' Choice"
1583,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>King's Crest, 25 year old, 40%<review>Amber gold color. Aromas of delicate fruit, coconut, vanilla and toffee, with delicate background oak notes. The flavor delivers what the aroma promises. It is nicely balanced, with a lingering dryish finish. 
"
1584,"<price>82<rating>81<whiskey>Singleton of Glen Ord 15 year old, 40%<review>Released in Taiwan in 2010, 15 year old Singleton of Glen Ord offers deep, smooth sherry and ginger notes on the nose. There’s vanilla, cocktail cherries, orange, malt, and dark chocolate on the palate. Long in the fruity then drying finish, cocoa powder, and finally, rather bitter oak. RM329"
1585,"<price>250<rating>78<whiskey>Spey Royal Choice, 46%<review>Hailing from the Speyside distillery, this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. A perception of bitterness beside dried peels. The palate is thick with stewing fruits, tinned prune, and burnt sugar, with a background note of wet draff. Water lifts things a little, but it's all rather sick and flabby. £150"
1586,"<price>69<rating>85<whiskey>The Dalmore Spey Dram, 40%<review>The Spey Dram is made up of 36 percent whisky matured in ex-oloroso casks and 64 percent from American oak. The nose offers fresh oranges, brittle toffee, cream, and ginger. The nutty palate reveals fresh fruits, and is significantly spicier than the other Rivers expressions, with ginger and even chili notes. The finish is long and notably spicy, with less chocolate than in the three other Rivers variants, ending with a touch of treacle. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
1587,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Ridgemont Reserve 1792 8 year old, 46.85%<review>The successor to Barton Brand’s Ridgewood Reserve 1792 bourbon. An improved successor, too. This bourbon is much more rounded than the Ridgewood, and has shed the aggressively dry, woody finish. The Ridgemont sports a nice silky texture. On the palate, gently sweet notes of vanilla, caramel, and candied fruit balance nicely with dry, spicy notes of mint, cinnamon, and green tea, with just a hint of tobacco on the finish. 
"
1588,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>FEW Alice in Chains All Secrets Known Tequila Barrel-Finished Bourbon (Batch 19H19), 50.5%<review>A fragrant, mellow nose of vanilla cream and root beer, with hints of lime, wood char, and oak. The palate offers racy red fruit, berry skins, desert herbs, chocolate, licorice, and oak tannins, with a minty, peppery note. The finish presents a new round of dry oak, peanuts, rich chocolate, cracked pepper, cedar, and red fruit. The tequila-barrel finishing creates an almost rye-like spiciness in this unusual, creative offering. (900 bottles)"
1589,"<price>135<rating>83<whiskey>Deanston 18 year old, 46.3%<review>This 18 year old was matured in refill hogsheads before a period of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is light and fruity with pears, melon, and mild vanilla, plus caramel and a hint of toffee. Rich and full on the textured palate, with big orchard fruits, honey, buttery spice notes, then emerging aniseed. Dries in the finish, with plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak notes, plus a sprinkling of chili heat."
1590,"<price>93<rating>90<whiskey>Mortlach Rare Old, 43.4%<review>The introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the Mortlach style. Stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes, wet Labrador, supple shoe leather, and varnish. A drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. The palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. Hefty but elegant. The distillery character is not only intact, but enhanced. £55/500 ml"
1591,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, 52%<review>Sweet, spicy nose, with sharp mint jellies and brittle sugar laid over the oak presence. Shifts in the mouth to no-nonsense rye: bitter, savory, dried grass, with the sweetness as a spark glinting through it all, while a mineral character plays as backbone. The finish is prickly and warming, with fleeting richness. A very lean rye overall, a bit challenging, a bit old school."
1592,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>J. Henry & Sons 5 year old Wisconsin Straight Bourbon (Batch 34), 46%<review>The nose offers a nice mélange of herbal and fruit notes, as pine sap, earthy forest floor, and menthol balance with sweet Bananas Foster and baked apple. More banana on the palate, plus juicy stone fruits sprinkled with cinnamon before a drying finish that nicely weaves cocoa, spices, oak, and saddle leather."
1593,"<price>39<rating>82<whiskey>Teeling Poitín, 61.5%<review>I'm really excited that new world whiskey makers and independents are challenging the way we think about whiskey. But there are concerns, too, such as flavored whiskeys, and white spirit sold as the finished article. Poitín is an Irish pauper's spirit made illegally, so legal definitions are patchy. It is normally made with potatoes. This is a mix of new make Irish single malt and new make Irish grain. It tastes like new make Irish whiskey. End of story."
1594,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Giant French Oak Barrel 19 year old, 45%<review>My favorite of the two [Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel]. Surprisingly sweet, with layers of caramel, butterscotch, nougat, and subtle creamy vanilla.  This whiskey defies its age. A blend of dried spice on the nose and the finish of the palate balances the sweetness. A very enjoyable (and drinkable) whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
1595,"<price>120<rating>95<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Special Cask Strength Bottling, 54.7%<review>As you’d expect, solid peat is the first thing out of the glass, but this isn’t just a peat beast. Underneath are honey, dried fruit, and malt. The palate is all about balance, with honeyed malt, raisin, and oak spice all complementing smoky peat. A lush mouthfeel makes you forget it’s cask strength. A pure love note in a glass from Compass Box to Park Avenue Liquor.  (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
1596,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Laphroaig Quarter Cask, 48%<review>This expression is aged for approximately 5 years in bourbon barrels before spending a final few months in quarter casks. Characteristic tar, engine oil, and ashy peat on the nose. Oily and full on the palate, with sweet grain notes, cinnamon, seaweed, hot peat, and black pepper. The finish is long and powerful, with persistent peat and chili, plus a sprinkling of sea salt."
1597,"<price>236<rating>91<whiskey>The Dalmore Distillery Exclusive 1991, 59%<review>Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined, polished oak on the nose. Honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. Fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. A long, spicy, citric finish. Finally, licorice. £150"
1598,"<price>430<rating>93<whiskey>Bruichladdich Legacy III 35 year old 1968 vintage, 40.7%<review>This gem is soft and seductive in personality. It is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. You'll find a bed of gentle sweetness, reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. A mélange of fruit (melon, black raspberries, strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. Fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. This Legacy III is more polished and rounded, and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. And the 40 year old, at $2,200 a pop, is also about five times more expensive."
1599,"<price>111<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Tùsail, 46%<review>Tùsail—apparently Gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition collection. It was distilled using floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley, once ubiquitous in the British brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. Oily on the nose, notably linseed, then becoming more floral. Cinnamon, ginger snaps, and faint new leather. Viscous on the palate, with poached pears, cloves, nutmeg, and polished oak. Drying, nutty oak in the finish. £76"
1600,"<price>322<rating>88<whiskey>Berry’s Own Selection (distilled at Jura) 1976, 55.1%<review>This expression of Jura is by leading London wine and spirits merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd, and was bottled in the company’s Berry’s Own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889. The nose offers sweet sherry and caramel, sultanas, cinnamon, and rum baba, with an elusive wisp of smoke. Full-bodied, very fruity on the palate, with mixed spices, pine cones, and old sherry notes. The finish is long, nutty, and luxurious. £200"
1601,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Sweet Peat, 40.8%<review>Created by blender George Harper, who worked on White Walker, this has nutty toffee, coffee grounds, caramelized sugars, roasted hazelnut in chocolate, an appreciable grain note, plus the titular gentle sweet peat smoke. Toasted oak, chocolate praline, sweet runny caramel, coffee, and a catch of smoke dissipate to leave the smooth flavor of creamy toffee penny candy. An uncut diamond with great potential set against the brilliance of Black Label. £30"
1602,"<price>589<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1978 (Cask #4004), 41.3%<review>The color is light gold, the nose is very sweet and delicate, with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in Glenfarclas. This is from a fourth-fill hogshead, which provides creaminess, toffee, a little hint of orchid, burnt cream, and grilled peach. Sweetly delicious. The palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding, with that creaminess continuing. All very summery and ‘up.’ Quite different, but appealing. £350"
1603,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Glendalough 13 year old, 46%<review>The oldest release yet under the Glendalough name, this bourbon cask whiskey brings forth a nose of lush caramels, malt, milky hot chocolate, nutmeg, with herbal notes hovering at the periphery. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and reassuringly malty. After an early spice kick, there is grapefruit, with mint eventually taking charge. Fizzy, effervescent candies pop on the palate and tongue. A medium-length finish, the mint diminishing to leave cinnamon and a little charred oak. A fine discovery."
1604,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Doc Swinson’s Cabernet Sauvignon Cask-Finished Bourbon, 46.2%<review>A profusion of nutty aromas: freshly shelled peanuts, boiled peanuts, and buttered pecan lead the way, with candied cherries and molasses on toast emerging on the palate. There are also heaps of dusty, drying oak throughout, helping to balance the oily texture. Finishes with chocolate-covered cherries, blueberry pie, more peanut, and drying wood tannins."
1605,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan 1998, 54.6%<review>This 1998 vintage triple distilled Lowland Auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks, which are rarely used for Scotch whisky maturation. The nose presents violets in fresh soil, honey, spice, developing citric fruit notes, and almonds. Quite full-bodied, fruity and zesty in the mouth. Lengthy in the finish, with spice, nuts, and oak. Becoming dry and gingery at the last."
1606,"<price>115<rating>87<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt & Grain Whisky, 46.5%<review>Delicate aromas of chamomile, marigolds, gardenias, peaches, apples, and vanilla undergirded by biscuity cereal notes transition seamlessly to an elegant palate of vanilla, green apples, malted milk balls, and fresh herbs. The finish has gentle spice that fades into warm chocolate with continuing creamy grain. A blend of Japanese and other whiskies that responds well to water."
1607,"<price>35<rating>85<whiskey>Ranger Creek .44 Rye, 47%<review>A new Small Caliber Series bottling, distilled from 100% rye. Nose gives rye dough, mint candies, and a push of rye oil and crushed grass. Punchy and perky on the tongue, hot and spicy young rye character with black pepper and bitter rye slicing through a sweet body; quite dynamic. Ranger Creek makes exciting whiskeys, for sure, and this one shows an increasing talent for balance. Price is per 375 ml."
1608,"<price>44<rating>82<whiskey>White Oak Akashi Meïsei Blended Whisky, 40%<review>Spicy and savory with dark soy sauce, the blackened bark of a hunk of roasted meat, peppercorn, fennel, and faint lemon zest. Lemon meringue pie and tangerine flavors; quite sweet, with lovely flowing spices throughout, and a few green notes, but when the creamy fudge comes in, the ride is over. Compared with the standard blend, this has greater balance, benefiting from the absence of the more abrasive spices and herbal aromas. Abrupt finish, leaving a hollow spiciness behind. £35"
1609,"<price>35<rating>90<whiskey>The Whistler Oloroso Sherry Cask-Finished, 43%<review>
Dried cherry, orange peel, and red fruits on the nose complemented by aromatic spices, toffee, hazelnut, plum jam, polished wood, macaroons, and a little oak toastiness. It’s thick and mouth coating, with toffee, fig, nutty chocolate, pepper, oak char, bitter cacao, and dark cherry. The blend has a 35% malt content and spent a minimum finishing period of a year in oloroso sherry hogsheads."
1610,"<price>135<rating>90<whiskey>Kilchoman Am Bùrach, 46%<review>Hand-rolled tobacco on the early nose, floral, with sweet peat smoke, vanilla, ripe apples, and raspberries heated over a wood fire. Smooth and mildly herbal on the palate, with spicy smoke and rich soft fruit notes, and lingering peat, cinnamon, and cocoa powder. Licorice, smoky fruit, and tannins in the finish. (1,350 bottles for U.S.)"
1611,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Castan Vilanova Roja Single Cask Single Malt (No. 69), 43%<review>Sebastian Castan only releases his whisky one cask at a time, and this variant comes from a single red wine barrel. A dark amber whisky with aromas of vanilla, toffee, peanut brittle, polished oak, dried orange peel, overripe strawberries, Brazil nut, and finely ground spices. Delicious, but a limited evolution of flavors, with dark toffee, clove, ginger, pepper, licorice, plum, red fruit, roasted nut, dark sugar, and chocolate brownies. (1,000 bottles)"
1612,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Benjamin Prichard’s Double Barreled Bourbon, 45%<review>Many distilleries have released bourbon finished in a second barrel, but it’s Prichard’s who was savvy enough to copyright the term “double barreled.”  As you’d expect, the nose is big oak, blending darker, more seasoned oak with lighter, new oak. The palate is unexpectedly balanced, with lush, sweet caramel in perfect sync with spicy oak, black pepper, clove, and cinnamon. That wonderful balance follows through to a medium finish that doesn’t leave you feeling like you’ve been chewing on a barrel."
1613,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Black Feather Bourbon, 43%<review>The nose begins with a whiff of new wood, but moves to orange peel, apricot, green banana, raisin bread, black tea, and raspberry Popsicle. The palate is youthful and syrupy in texture, with notes of milk chocolate, burnt almond, vanilla frosting, and chili spice. The finish is barrel-influenced but light and honeyed, with notes of milk chocolate, nuttiness, and spice."
1614,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Soldier Valley Omaha Beach Bourbon, 45%<review>There are nostalgic bubble gum notes on the nose—Bazooka and Big League Chew—as well as orange sherbet, strawberry shortcake, cherry pie, snickerdoodles, and milk chocolate. Sweet and fruit-forward on the palate, with grape jelly, cherry preserves, chocolate, cinnamon, clove, and a hint of rose water. It finishes a bit short and soft, rolling out spiced oak and a bouquet of candied violets. (700 bottles)"
1615,"<price>176<rating>89<whiskey>Old Hobart Overeem Port Cask Matured, 60%<review>Last year’s cask strength version was 55% and way too young. There is also a view that the early stages of maturation in port are not only inconsistent, but can be negatively wayward. No such problems here. This is no longer an ugly duckling but a young swan: rich fruitcake, fresh summer fruits, and a charcoal undercarpet that helps quash the overly sweet notes. This then is the world's most improved whisky. A$170"
1616,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Port Charlotte 10 year old, 50%<review>After many limited releases, we finally have a permanent age-statement expression of Port Charlotte, with a satisfying number of years under its belt. Distilled from Scottish-grown barley, it is matured predominantly in first-fill American oak casks, along with second-fill American and second-fill French wine casks. It is peated to 40ppm, in line with other Islay heavy-hitters, but the peat is never a blunt instrument, retaining sufficient restraint to allow other characteristics—maritime notes, the sweetness of caramel, coconut, and orchard fruits—to shine through. Number 4 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
1617,"<price>72<rating>87<whiskey>Haig Club, 40%<review>A confectioner’s delight; Fry’s Five Centres, lime, lemon, kumquat, iced buns, fresh mint, and crushed cardamom that matches the chocolate aromas. Those re-charred, rejuvenated casks are very much in evidence here. It has a gilded, satiny sheen, glistening with lemon drizzle cake, butterscotch, orange matchsticks, and banana bread. Incontrovertibly, it inhabits a signature grain style, but it fizzles out with a sticky, sweet aftertaste, like licking the spoon from the icing bowl. £45"
1618,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail ('Smith's Glenlivet') 21 year old, 43%<review>Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe red strawberries, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee. Some charred oak on the finish. This whisky has a gentle, soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included)."
1619,"<price>52<rating>89<whiskey>Glenmorangie Lasanta 12 year old, 43%<review>Following a decade in bourbon barrels, Lasanta is finished for 2 years in oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Caramel, milk chocolate, and hazelnuts merge on the nose with the spicy dried fruit and orange notes associated with sherry wood maturation. Spicy sultanas, and damsons on the full, sweet palate, with more caramel, milk chocolate, nutmeg, and oak. The finish is long and smooth, with dark chocolate and wood spices."
1620,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Rye, 47%<review>With a mashbill of 70% rye, 18% corn, and 12% malted barley, this rye doesn’t disappoint. Butter-toasted rye bread and vanilla, with hints of herbs and campfire smoke. Then fruit…a lot of fruit: pear, banana, pineapple, followed by a bevy of sweets—caramel, butterscotch, and toffee, mainly—with a delightful cinnamon bread finish. This skews more toward bourbon than the Indiana ryes, and that’s a good thing."
1621,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>SanTan Spirits Butcher Jones Cask-Strength Arizona Straight (Batch 9-2), 63.2%<review>Without water, most of the aromas and flavors are locked up, so taste neat and then add it generously. When you do, you’ll unveil toasted grain, nuts, apple peels, bran muffin, and vanilla on the nose, along with plenty of oak. The opened palate yields cinnamon and mint, dark chocolate shot through with orange flavor, toasted almonds, grain, and, again, plenty of oak. Warming and bittersweet on the finish, which has both coffee bean and cinnamon-pecan coffee cake: a winning combination."
1622,"<price>192<rating>88<whiskey>New Zealand's 2011 Vindication, 52.3%<review>A single cask, cask strength 16 year old malt from the demolished Willowbank distillery to celebrate the New Zealand All Blacks World Cup victory, and further evidence that New Zealand is back on track. This is whisky hitting its stride. Creamy and honeyed with a cracked lemon pepper undercoat, it's fresh, and very drinkable, with a delightful sugar and spice combo running through it. Oak only really makes an appearance in the finale. NZ$229"
1623,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Painted Stave Diamond State Bourbon (Batch 2), 47%<review>A coppery, auburn color betrays small barrels, in this case just ten gallons. The distinctive aroma of sassafras recalls rolling in a pile of autumn leaves, then quickly gives way to the apparent spice of a high-rye mashbill. The earthy and spicy qualities meld nicely, developing cedar box and sandalwood, wrapped in the sweetness of maple syrup, while the palate feels slick and buttery before a finish lingering with cinnamon and warm oatmeal cookie."
1624,"<price>93<rating>91<whiskey>Shelter Point 100% Rye, 59.7%<review>Before a regulation required British Columbia distillers to source their ingredients within the province, Shelter Point bought some 100% rye spirit from Alberta Distillers. Nine years later, it has developed flavors of halvah and honey, which caress blue clay, turning it sweet, floral, and fruity, then hot and spicy, with cloves, rose water, and more rye spices. Clean and crisp with deep complexity, it sizzles on the tongue, ending in hints of grain. (Canada only-CAD$125)"
1625,"<price>50<rating>94<whiskey>Larceny Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight (Batch C920), 61.2%<review>
Sweet grain-driven aromas dominate the nose: blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, orange marmalade on toast, honey-roasted peanuts, toasted coconut, brown sugar, and cherry cordial candies. The palate is equally expressive, chewy with peanuts and roasted pecans, milk chocolate, orange, cinnamon, ginger, white pepper, and big chunky oak, which turns mouthwatering on the lengthy, peppery, nutty finish. Though a proof this high can get unwieldy, it never shows a hair out of place.

1626,"<price>50<rating>76<whiskey>K5 Premium Spirit Whisky, 40%<review>From the Land of the Thunder Dragon comes this blend of 8 and 12 year old malts and grain from the Gelephu distillery. It’s clean, light, and fragrant with dried hay notes; like drinking chamomile tea in a tropical greenhouse. The thin flavors show custard tarts, cracker bread, and pencil erasers with a bitter aftertaste of burnt spices. So, not so great as a sipping whisky, but I’ve found it versatile as a base for summer cocktails."
1627,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Edradour Ballechin 10 year old, 46%<review>After eight no-age-statement releases of Edradour’s heavily-peated Ballechin, the brand finally comes of age as a core product. It is bottled at 10 years of age after maturing in a combination of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Earthy peat and fragrant spices on the nose, old leather, and faint toffee. The palate initially offers very fruity peat, then newer leather, aniseed, and plain chocolate, with lingering fruity peatiness. More plain chocolate and ginger in the smoky, medium-length finish."
1628,"<price>59<rating>86<whiskey>Clan Denny 2008 10 year old (distilled at Craigellachie), 46%<review>This bottling from Douglas Laing was distilled in January 2008, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in October 2018. Floral notes on the nose, with barley, vanilla, soft spice, and baked apple. Full-on orchard fruits and more barley on the palate. Soft and sweet. The finish dries, becoming slightly earthy and tannic, with black pepper. (371 bottles)"
1629,"<price>135<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box The Entertainer, 46%<review>This is a special bottling for London department store Selfridge's, but it represents a clever strategy by artisan Compass Box to set its own agenda by regionalizing its whiskies. This is a long way from the New York blend—indeed, creamier and sweeter than other recent releases. It has a honey heart, traces of cinnamon, and menthol in the mix, plus wispy smoke. There's some spice and peat late on, but in relatively subdued form. Very pleasant. £85"
1630,"<price>100<rating>80<whiskey>Belgian Owl Cask 4276140 5 year old 2012, 76.1%<review>Yep, you read that right. A whopping 76.1% ABV. Belgian Owl has matured its whisky in warm and brightly lit warehouses so the spirit sort of cooks. You have to add water and add water and add water until…darn it, you've gone too far. If you do manage to get it right—at about 46%—it offers nothing extra to what you get from the 46% version. Too much like hard work and really not worth the effort. "
1631,"<price>85<rating>88<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila) 15 year old, 40%<review>Amber gold color. An exciting aroma-classic Islay. It is very phenolic, reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln. Interwoven spice (especially pepper), seaweed, and sweet & sour notes add complexity. Light to medium in body, but quite oily. Nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, salt & pepper, all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. Lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. Yet another example of Caol Ila's fine pedigree. This bottling has great balance, and I especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. My only criticism is that it is a bit soft for Caol Ila. I would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% ABV, which would give it a bit more guts."
1632,"<price>76<rating>87<whiskey>Kilchoman Coull Point, 46%<review>This strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of Kilchoman’s recent bottlings, and also the sweetest. Intense and very forward, there’s baked apple, humidor notes, honeydew melon, fresh shellfish. Water brings out a putty-like youthfulness, so take it neat. The palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup), then the smoke folds itself over. A good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.(World of Whiskies UK Travel Retail only) £45"
1633,"<price>26<rating>90<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1997 Vintage, 43.3%<review>A bright and lively bourbon. Nicely balanced, too, with notes of caramel custard, red licorice, orange marmalade, golden raisin, and coconut cream, underpinned by crisp rye and tantalizing cinnamon. A gently sweetish whiskey -- not cloying in any way. In fact, it’s very drinkable. And it’s a whiskey that demonstrates great harmony between youth and maturity."
1634,"<price>550<rating>90<whiskey>The Balvenie 30 year old, 47.3%<review>A special Balvenie to honor Master Distiller David Stewart’s 30 years working at the distillery. This is a big and brooding dram. The aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak. It’s complex and richly flavored (sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish), with notes of honey, candied fruit, thick cut marmalade, vanilla, almonds, and prominent spicy oak notes. I’m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression, which I like. It finishes firmly dry, with notes of spice and tannin. While I enjoy this whisky a great deal, you might want to seek out the Balvenie 25 year old (which I rated a 93) while the odd bottle is still available. It is slightly more rounded on the palate, and less than half the cost."
1635,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>Glenmorangie Astar 2017 Release, 52.5%<review>Glenmorangie Astar returns after a five-year absence. Astar is matured in custom toasted casks made from slow-growing trees on north-facing slopes in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. The barrels harbor bourbon for four years before heading to Glenmorangie. That level of provenance doesn’t come cheap, which is why the original Astar was discontinued in 2012, just four years after its acclaimed appearance. The exquisite Glenmorangie aromas and flavors—floral, with rose hips and orange blossom—are dialed up to new levels of intensity, while the voluptuous and sweet palate exudes harmony and balance.

1636,"<price>37<rating>84<whiskey>Cody Road Bourbon (Batch 8), 45%<review>“Aged less than 4 years.” Sharp new oak (this is 30-gallon barrel aged), with hot cinnamon and sugar in the nose. Dry, and a bit hot up front, but its wheat comes through in a smoother, sweeter middle and a gentle, warm finish where corn finally appears. No real flaws here; it could be better integrated, but it has a rough appeal."
1637,"<price>28<rating>90<whiskey>The Dubliner Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>This just makes me happy. The nose brims with pure blossom honey, a dose of vanilla, whole peach, butter toffee, and an uplifting floral bouquet. A soothingly sweet and syrupy smooth concoction; this light-bodied whiskey of honey, caramel, and toffee feels like it should be dispensed with kindness in regular doses from a medicine spoon. The epitome of uncomplicated, easy-drinking, bourbon cask-matured whiskey."
1638,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1998 Vintage, 43.3%<review>Darker, more lush, and with less of the crisp, lively spice notes when compared to last year’s vintage. (Keep in mind that single cask bottlings vary from cask to cask.) The predominant component of the new vintage is its layers of sweetness (toffee, molasses, vanilla fudge, and candy corn), with underlying nougat and glazed fruit. An enjoyable, soothing bourbon, but I would like to see more spice and fruit to go with the sweet notes. This whiskey will work nicely after dinner (perhaps with a cigar?)"
1639,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>BeanBall Bourbon, 50%<review>Label: “BeanBall Bourbon – Tennessee Straight Bourbon Whiskey.” Believed to be from Dickel, but no confirmation; just the huge cracked corn component in the nose, which should be all you need. My, that’s tasty as it spreads like warm oil over the tongue, hot corn spirit spiked hard with oak. Good oak, dried corn, and a snap of mint in the finish. Nice selection…and interesting labeling in light of the recent Tennessee whiskey definition squabbles. Sourced whiskey."
1640,"<price>76<rating>83<whiskey>Tweeddale 14 year old Batch 4, 46%<review>This batch of 1,420 bottles was created with slightly older malts, a 16 year old grain from a refill hogshead and a 14 year old Lowland malt disgorged from an Islay cask. Sugar mice, dried hay, sharpened pencils, hints of lemon, with subtle smoke like the burning of a distant stubble field. Sweet cereal notes, black pepper, and ginger parkin build to a conclusion of Brazil nut, mocha, and chocolate ganache. (UK & Netherlands only) £45"
1641,"<price>110<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Invergordon) 28 year old 1987, 56.5%<review>Sweet top notes of brioche loaf with baking spices, but there are savory flavors of pastrami bark lurking deep in the glass. Flavors of golden syrup and butterscotch unfurl beautifully from within the thick texture at cask strength. Roasted spices explode, but as it dilutes, stewed fruits and sucked boiled candy notes are found. Water emphasizes confectionary elements and purple fruits, but kills the spices stone dead. Dry, spicy heat on the finish. (490 bottles) £85"
1642,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>1792 Full Proof, 62.5%<review>No age statement on the label, but aged for 8 1/2 years. Bottled at the same ABV as its entry proof into the barrel. Lush and mouth-coating. A pleasingly sweet bourbon, with caramel, nougat, and chewy toffee, mixed with ripe orchard fruit, golden raisin, and creamy vanilla. Soothing finish. A wonderful way to end a meal. (With a cigar, perhaps?) This is a beautiful bourbon and a great value given its quality, ABV, and price."
1643,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey> Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch B520), 63.6%<review>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch B517 was our Whisky of the Year in 2017, and this latest release continues the tradition. The nose exudes spice, rich chocolate, and caramel, followed by a palate that’s loaded with spice, herbs, vanilla, and more chocolate. Water enhances the spice, and also brings out an espresso note. A spice-filled finish is rich and chocolaty. Water enhances it all, but even without, it’s superbly balanced and rich."
1644,"<price>64<rating>91<whiskey>The Temple Bar 10 year old, 40%<review>Bright citrus, zested lime, grapefruit peel, crystalized fruits, malted biscuits, and oak, overlaid with dry spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon bark. A creamy, malty palate yields to an initial spicy base layer. When the spices step aside, there is dried orange, fudge sweetness, and chocolate orange. Tangy, concentrated orange, with spices fraying from the edges completes the finish."
1645,"<price>22<rating>80<whiskey>Midnight Moon, 40%<review>Unaged, triple distilled spirit, produced and bottled at Piedmont Distillers in North Carolina. Clean nose with hints of unripe honeydew, bond paper, and wet crushed chalk. Very soft on the palate, clean, with no burn at all. Slippery-smooth, a tiny bit sweet. Tastes like good vodka, really; not much grain here at all. Easy to drink, but…where’s the excitement?"
1646,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Tamdhu Batch Strength (#002), 58.5%<review>The first Batch Strength expression of Tamdhu appeared in 2015 and was also matured entirely in sherry casks and not chill filtered. Big, sweet sherry notes on the nose, with vanilla, sultanas, maraschino cherries, and Turkish Delight. Rich and full-bodied, with oloroso sherry, milk chocolate, vanilla, dates, ripe cherries, sweet oak, and allspice. The finish is sweet and long, with lingering, lively spices. A very quaffable, well-priced dram for sherry bomb lovers."
1647,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>Aberfeldy 21 year old, 40%<review>Similar in flavor to the Aberfeldy 12 reviewed below, but with more depth. There’s more orange rind in the marmalade notes, along with Clementine and coconut. The whisky finishes drier too, with a spicy flair. Still quite clean and nicely balanced throughout. A whisky for those of you who want a fun whisky that’s not heavy on the palate."
1648,"<price>140<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza, 46%<review>Following the Spice Tree recipe of 60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, and 20% Teaninich, Extravaganza’s core was matured for more than four additional years in light/medium toast, refill, and heavy toast hybrid casks of American and French oak. Finally, sherry-matured Glen Ord, Benrinnes, and Allt-a-Bhainne were added to the mix. The elaborate process is typical of maverick blender John Glaser, but it’s his results that count. Flavors of peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry translate into a delicious honeyed palate of caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit. Ginger and clove provide further rigor before a finish of incendiary spices. Number 7 in the 2017 Top 20

the northern edge of Toronto. Distinct notes of poached pears, marzipan, flaky halva, and cinnamon apple pie embellish sweet ripe cherries, nutmeg, and a vague earthiness. Oatmeal, dry grain, and hot pepper combine on a sweet, polished palate. C$100"
1650,"<price>239<rating>81<whiskey>Abhainn Dearg Single Malt Special Edition, 46%<review>The first spirit distilled at Abhainn Dearg is now 3 years old and legally Scotch single malt whisky. The distillery has celebrated with a single cask, non-colored, non-chill filtered release of 2,011 500 ml bottles. Apricots, crystallized ginger, candied peel, and papier-mâché on the nose. The palate features fresh fruit, spicy oak, honeycomb, and finally, toffee. Quite short in the finish, with more toffee, and a nutty note. £150"
1651,"<price>54<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes Manse Reserve, 43%<review>The youngest of the Manse Brae triumvirate, and also the freshest. Here is Rothes at its liveliest, with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels, dessert apples, and hot malted milk. On the tongue it is quite delicate, but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer, just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. Fantastic price as well.

1652,"<price>285<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut Greedy Angels 8 year old, 50%<review>Rejoice! Those greedy angels have left sufficient liquid behind in the Amrut warehouse for a new release. Chocolate ganache, dark fudge, rye bread, toasted fennel seed, overripe mango, lavender, and parma violet aromas. It’s divine: chocolate brownie, orange peel, espresso, bramble, candied fruit jellies, toffee, and blackened oak, with a finish of fruity chocolate. Repay such celestial avarice by acquiring some of this heavenly whisky for yourself. (180 bottles for the U.S.)"
1653,"<price>152<rating>86<whiskey>Tomatin Contrasting Casks Sherry Matured, 46%<review>Tomatin has released a limited edition (5,400) pack comprising two 350ml bottles, each containing a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. One was matured in bourbon barrels (see below); this one in sherry casks. Initially savory on the nose, then warm leather, sherry, and glacé cherries. Very smooth on the palate with soft spices, which increase in intensity. Black treacle and Seville oranges. Peppery treacle and old oak in the finish. £100"
1654,"<price>57<rating>88<whiskey>Tobermory 12 year old, 46.3%<review>This new core expression was launched in 2019 to celebrate the reopening of Tobermory Distillery after two years of remodeling. The whisky was matured principally in bourbon barrels, with a small proportion being finished in virgin oak. The nose yields honeycomb, vanilla fudge, orange blossom, and cinnamon. Quite full-bodied, with cloves on the early palate, apricots, and malt. Licorice, spicy dark berries, and more cloves in the finish. (£46)"
1655,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Arran Single Bourbon Cask (Cask 1801) 1996 Vintage, 50.5%<review>Fresh and clean, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, honey, caramel apple, and toasted coconut.

Dry, with a farmy earthiness, and like the scotch hogsheads it was finished in, bigger than life. Icing sugar, red wine, and floral perfume. WhistlePig was the original U.S.-bottled Canadian 100% flavoring rye and after 4 years flexing in Vermont its muscles are enormous."
1657,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Widow Jane 14 year old The Vaults Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 1), 49.5%<review>The nose is fragrant and well-integrated with the oak, offering candied orange slices, peach, and notes of dried red berries. The palate is smooth and has flavors of bright fruit, drying oak tannins, raspberry jam, and semi-sweet chocolate. The finish is lengthy, with more fruit notes as well as brown sugar, chocolate, and pepper spice. The oak flirts with being overdone, but creates a balanced and solid expression of well-aged bourbon.

1658,"<price>58<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank 12 year old, 50%<review>(Reviewer's note: This is a bottling exclusive to Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, IL.) Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown whisky. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout. A bold and satisfying Springer, with more character that the 175th Anniversary 12 year old distillery bottling that has been in circulation."
1659,"<price>48<rating>80<whiskey>Ledaig 10 year old, 43%<review>Sweet, ripe barley, balanced by damp peat, tar, and burning embers. Some spice notes (pepper, anise) linger on the finish. While enjoyable now, some of the flavors seem to behave more like individual solos, rather than harmony. I think they will begin to integrate nicely by the time this generation of Ledaig reaches its teens."
1660,"<price>110<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance Young & Feisty (distilled at Talisker), 46%<review>Douglas Laing has added a no age statement bottling of Talisker to its Provenance range, tagging it as “Young and Feisty.” It comprises whisky from casks #10227 and 10229. Lively and up front, with bubblegum, wood smoke, and black pepper on the nose. Developing ozone. Zesty soft fruits, emerging dark peat notes, and more pepper on the palate. The finish is quite short, nutty, and slightly metallic. Young and feisty indeed! £65"
1661,"<price>248<rating>93<whiskey>Convalmore 1977 28 year old, 57.9%<review>OK, confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever, a classic example of what long, slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature, bring out butterscotch, ginseng, honey, deepen the orchard fruits, and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance, it has finesse, and there’s not much left. £155(Not available in the U.S.)"
1662,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Artein, 46%<review>Artein is the third release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition range, with ‘artein’ being Gaelic for stone. The expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky, finished in ‘Super Tuscan’ wine casks. Briefly pear drops, then vanilla on the nose, with developing peaches and apricots, shot through with mild ginger. Viscous, mouth-coating, intense, dark fruits, spice, aniseed, and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. The finish is fruity, long, and herbal."
1663,"<price>120<rating>93<whiskey>Kilchoman STR Cask-Matured (2019 Release), 50%<review>This was distilled in 2012 and matured in 43 red wine casks that had been shaved, toasted, and recharred, hence ‘STR.’ The nose offers rich, creamy, medicinal peat, sea salt, vanilla, and loganberries. Sweet berry notes and caramel on the slick palate, then peat gathers momentum, with cinnamon and tangy citrus fruits. The finish features barbecue smoke, chili, and black pepper.

Imagine Dylan’s Candy Bar did a pop-up at Sephora and you’ll get the idea. The fruity flavor gives intense orange oils, sweet candy notes, warm caramel, and a fiery edge of peppery spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. This has everything I want in a grain whisky.

1665,"<price>1586<rating>92<whiskey>Balvenie 1992 vintage, 49.8%<review>Slightly oily on the nose, with old leather, ginger, and furniture polish. Ultimately, red berry notes. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, with polished oak, aniseed, and wood spices. The finish dries slowly with oak tannins, but a spicy fruit note never quite disappears. £1,200"
1666,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Ceran St. Vrain’s Taos Lightning Rye, 45%<review>Another MGP/LDI-sourced rye, which KGB Spirits then ages additionally at their Alcalde, New Mexico site; it’s tagged as a 15 year old whiskey. An oaky, sweet nose with hot cereal notes. The tongue impact is breathtaking: a hot, thick slam of spice, mint, and wood that cools to a long, sweet mint finish. A bit of water tames it a bit and brings out more oaky notes and more sweetness. Powerful stuff."
1667,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Company Discovery Series #1 Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 60.61%<review>Candy corn, butter, warm frosted buns, strawberry tart, and powdered sugar on the nose. The palate is spiced with cinnamon, clove, and roasted walnuts, as well as chocolate-covered cherries, raspberry cobbler, and a hint of coconut shavings. Length, depth, and heat on a finish of chocolate, caramel, and bursts of sweet baking spice. Deep and complex, balancing dark fruits, chocolate, spice, and tobacco. Powerful and subtle all at once."
1668,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Lagavulin Distillers' Edition 1991 Vintage, 43%<review>More polished and sophisticated than the comparably sweet and lush Lagavulin 21 year old also reviewed here. The pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. An array of complex ripe fruit, interwoven with notes of pot still rum, toffee, tar, seaweed, and brine on the finish. It seems logical to marry this big, smoky Islay whisky with an equally big, sweet, fruity sherry. In this case, the marriage works wonderfully."
1669,"<price>13500<rating>97<whiskey>Bowmore 46 year old (distilled 1964), 42.9%<review>There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice."

Drying in the relatively long finish, with subtle oak. Well worth the wait! (629 bottles) £210"
1671,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>High West Light Whiskey, 46%<review>This is a batch of 100 barrels of MGP light whiskey, an American whiskey using higher distillation proofs and used cooperage. It reminds me of 1980s Crown Royal, with floral vibrancy, honey, and a slight hint of chocolate, followed by licorice, allspice, and vanilla. Its spice hits early and often with balanced black licorice. Blackberry, blueberry, and ginger come down the final stretch for a nice medium-length finish. Sourced whiskey. (Distillery only)"
1672,"<price>33<rating>88<whiskey>1792 Sweet Wheat Bourbon, 45.6%<review>Barton 1792 distillery’s first-ever wheated bourbon, where the wheat replaces rye as the ‘spice’ ingredient (similar to Weller and Maker’s Mark). A sweet and fruity whiskey, with vanilla wafer, cotton candy, caramel custard, blackberry, and ripe peach. Soft oak spice and polished leather on the finish keep the sweetness in check. Very gentle in personality; a great starter bourbon."
1673,"<price>3000<rating>94<whiskey>Royal Salute 62 Gun Salute, 43%<review>Named after the gun rounds fired on Royal anniversaries at the Tower of London. Heightened sherry tones with dark Madagascar chocolate, Brazil nut, fondant cream, and faint espresso indulge the nose. One heavenly sip reveals a velvety smooth whisky, thick and sticky, all revolving around the chocolate and nut, with a little support from dark fruits. You can chew over this for hours as the finish soft-pedals the main themes. A work of genius."

There’s also orange blossom, pecans, cedar chest, and tobacco. Aromas and flavors unfold in layers, with rich oak, roasted pecans, and vanilla whipped cream juxtaposed against peppery spice, blueberry-cinnamon crumble, and sweet tea. Water reveals new depths."

This release comes from its previous incarnation as part of DCL. The elegant, mature nose shows an ‘Old Speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley, cacao, cigar humidor, and potpourri. The palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches, while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
1676,"<price>25<rating>89<whiskey>Wild Turkey Russell's Reserve 10 year old, 50.5%<review>Amber chestnut color. Mature aromas of oak, vanilla, toffee, and leather.

1677,"<price>24<rating>80<whiskey>Deveron 10 year old, 40%<review>This expression from Macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015. The nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft malt. The palate yields new-mown hay, toffee apples, and quite sweet oak. The finish is medium in length and softly spiced. (France only) €21"
1678,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>John Jacôb Handmade Whiskey, 40%<review>This 100% rye whiskey was distilled at Fremont Mischief, and aged in oak. The flinty-minty rye spice blows right out at you, with a ripple of oaky vanilla. Beautiful youthful rye spirit, with crackling rye spiciness, sweet floral notes, and hints of horehound candy. The finish is a bit disappointing — fading somewhat quickly — but mainly because the rest of it's so good. Great price for mellowness in this category, too."
1679,"<price>120<rating>79<whiskey>Highland Park 19 year old 1986 vintage, 53.8%<review>Rich and viscous in texture. Sappy waxed fruit, maple syrup, and nougat. Becoming quite nutty with emerging notes of damp peat, dates, plum and blueberry. The sherry is fairly dominant and masks some of the whisky's subtleties. After dinner with a cigar, perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Beltramo's.)"
1680,"<price>169<rating>85<whiskey>Limeburners Sherry Cask, 61%<review>Brace yourself: the marauding alcohol vapors will slap you across the chops within inches of the glass. The finishing vessel, a small sherry cask, exudes sweet red fruits; Fragola Fabbri candied strawberries, stewed apples, and brandy characteristics. Diving in neat, become immersed in a sweeping intensity of fruity plum, crabapple, and fig. Taming with water unlocks flavors of honey, caramel, green fruits, and vanilla, though it retains that plum leitmotif throughout. Finish of black pepper on stewed fruits. A$220"
1681,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey>Jameson Bow Street 18 year old Cask Strength, 55.3%<review>This whiskey finishes its maturation at Bow St., Dublin, the first time this former distillery site has been involved in any whiskey production since 1975. A beautiful balance between toffee, spice, and oak, this has aromas of concentrated citrus, polished oak tables, caramels, and nut brittle. A supremely smooth concoction of dark nutty toffee, vanilla, pepper, clove, and oak. The strength is epic. Fabulous, rewarding special occasion stuff."
1682,"<price>110<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection Ledaig 1993 St-Joseph Wood Finish, 45%<review>Distilled in May 1993, this bottling is of the Ledaig heavily-peated variant of Tobermory single malt. Aged for 19 years, it was ‘finished’ for 40 months in wine casks from the St-Joseph AOC in northern Rhône. Pickled beetroot, emerging caramel, and distant log-fire embers on the nose. Voluptuous and fruity, notably spicy—pepper and ginger—plus mulled wine notes. Quite lengthy in the finish, with lingering spice. Peatiness is most evident here. 2,200 bottles.  "

Sweet fruit tempers the herbaceous and mineral palate; layers of cooked berry, Coca-Cola, cherries, lemon oil, and peanuts create a silky, rounded profile, all tied up with generous oak. Finished in Black Bird Cider Works hard cider casks."

With a minimum of 40% malt, this fine blend has a rather perfumed nose of fresh mint, green apple, sliced melon, and tropical fruits. The soft candy sugar and butterscotch palate builds, with layers of malt, cherry laces, gingerbread, and pfeffernüsse leading to a ginger and spice finish of significant length. Highly accomplished. £26"
1686,"<price>100<rating>79<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Craigellachie) 1996, 52.7%<review>Craigellachie is one of Scotland’s most interesting distilleries: its worm tubs providing a deliberately sulfury new make whose aromas flash off after maturation to reveal a deeply floral, pineapple-accented palate. Here, sadly, an inactive cask has meant that cabbagey sulfur has not been fully worked out. The fleshiness of the mature spirit is emerging, but this should have been kept in cask for another five years or so. Lacks balance and maturity. £60"
1687,"<price>200<rating>82<whiskey>Signatory 'Mosstowie' (distilled at Miltonduff), 27 year old, 1979 vintage, Cask # 12759, 54.1%<review>A pleasing malt all around, if not overly complex or challenging. Clean, full malt foundation (the Lomond still is obvious), vanilla, and butterscotch with soft fruit and balancing dry oak spice that lingers on the finish.

1688,"<price>29<rating>87<whiskey>Redemption High Rye, 45%<review>Sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout. Vanilla and caramel meet burnt oak and charcoal smoke, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, and a lot of coffee. Hazelnut and salt water taffy jump in for a quick note just before a medium finish with a hint of smoke."
1689,"<price>30<rating>71<whiskey>Peaden Brothers Genuine Corn Whiskey Moonshine Fox 382 Special Edition, 50%<review>The nose starts with sweet corn, cornmeal, yeasty bread, and black pepper, with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind. The entry is soft and round, with dry cornmeal, bran flakes, and yeasty bread. Unfortunately, the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper. Everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish. The heart of this whiskey is interesting, but it could benefit from a much tighter cut. (distillery store only)"
1690,"<price>99<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie Companta, 46%<review>Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of whiskies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. Spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate."
1691,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace, 45%<review>Effervescent, tingly mouthfeel, but the flavor begins after the initial warmth, with hints of caramel apple, pumpkin pie, apricot, and a slight hint of caramel popcorn. Then it’s pumice, apricot, and marmalade, followed by salt water taffy, cinnamon, and a big burst of nutmeg. A long finish offers a hint of peach pie."
1692,"<price>815<rating>85<whiskey>Old Pulteney 35 year old, 42.5%<review>Just 450 cases of this veteran expression from Old Pulteney have been released, offered in non-chill filtered format after maturation in a mixture of bourbon casks and Spanish oak sherry casks. Light fruit notes on the nose, notably tangerines, plus vanilla, lemon, and sea salt. Orchard fruits, spicy sherry, worn leather, and cocoa powder on the silky palate. Spicy and drying in the finish, with mild oak tannins."
1693,"<price>30<rating>79<whiskey>Dark Corner Moonshine, 50%<review>White whiskey, amazing legs on the glass. Classic white dog nose: green corn, estery fruits, a bit sharp, but not burny hot. Clean taste of corn spirit, no off flavors, and very well-mannered for 50%, unaged whiskey; I can hold this on my tongue easily, and there are some good bits of sweet candy as it rolls off. Nicely done."
1694,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Douglas of Drumlanrig (distilled at Caol Ila), Cask #6616, 1985 vintage, 25 year old, 53.9%<review>Soft and gentle (for Caol Ila, that is), thanks to the 25 years of aging. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation, along with coal tar, licorice root, and olive, with a hint of brine, juniper, unsweetened dark chocolate, and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). Very nice. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
1695,"<price>101<rating>88<whiskey>Paddy Centenary Edition, 43.2%<review>This marks the biggest identity change since Clark Kent morphed into Superman; the plodding Paddy brand has been reshaped for this limited edition into a young and feisty pot still whiskey. It's meant to recreate the taste of 100 years past, which begs the question: what happened? This has raspberry, violet, and pear, but there's a mysterious stranger at the heart, a pepper and oily center: a bit like a gypsy in a wedding dress. But it scrubs up well. €75"
1696,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2017-01 “Tommy’s Batch,” 64.25%<review>At 6 years, 4 months, and 6 days, this is beautiful. Honey, cinnamon, and marzipan are the opening trifecta, preparing you for roasted-nut wonders: almond, walnut, and pecan. Then it’s complex crème brûlée, balsamic vinaigrette, salted caramel, molasses, maple syrup, and hints of toasted pine nuts, leather, and anise. With an eyedropper of water, it becomes a caramel bomb. In both cases, long finishes await, with hints of caramel."
1697,"<price>50<rating>94<whiskey>Stagg Jr. Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (13th Edition), 64.2%<review>This kicks off with a bounty of dark fruit—dark berries, cherry cough drops, and currants—coupled with heaps of vanilla, mocha, and rich oaky notes. Big and brawny on the palate, it pours bold and viscous, the blueberry and blackberry fruit balanced with the sweet-bitter notes of burnt sugar and pipe tobacco. The flavors harmonize beautifully, culminating in a finish of dark jam, coffee, and semi-sweet chocolate."
1698,"<price>87<rating>90<whiskey>Port Charlotte Islay Barley 2008, 50%<review>Robust Port Charlotte character, with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me, PC comes fully of age here. £55"
1699,"<price>55<rating>91<whiskey>Grand MacNish Double Matured 15 year old Sherry Cask Finish, 43%<review>Rather luxurious aromas of orange peel, walnut, stewed fruits, fleshy plum, peach pit, sherry fruit, gentle oak, and wood spices. Spiced marmalade, dark Seville orange, plum, vanilla, and plump raisin; this lays down a rich blanket of flavor, though it’s slit open by a piercing blade of spice. I like the subtlety of the sherry influence and the mouth-coating finish of orange peel, ginger, and spice."
1700,"<price>99<rating>90<whiskey>Glenfarclas 17 year old, 43%<review>Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. A femme fatale of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act."
1701,"<price>317<rating>87<whiskey>Samaroli ’S Peaty 2017, 45%<review>Encompassing more than just Islay malts, the youngest liquid in this is from 1995. Malt loaf, peat barns, heavy salty smoke, hazelnut latte, roasted fennel seed, star anise, and sooty embers. This one could set the smoke alarms off. Good weight in the mouth, with pears in chocolate, clove, aniseed, vegetal notes, and deceptively less smoke until the powerfully intense finish of spice, soft fruit, cocoa, and seemingly eternal smoke."
1702,"<price>20<rating>77<whiskey>Texas Crown Club, 40%<review>Porridge, butterscotch, and a little dust on the nose. Rosewater and some spice on the palate, but the floral notes are out of balance. Hot peppers, slightly pulling, and a bit mealy on the tongue, then a pleasing earthiness. The label says “ultra premium,” the taste says “not so much.” The best feature is the pepper, which will bolster ginger ale and cut through cola because this is not really for sipping."
1703,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Bone Snapper X-Ray 4 year old Reserve Straight Rye (Batch 2), 55%<review>This pours punchy, vivid, and somewhat youthful with sparks of white pepper, cereal grain aromas, and an impression of menthol and alpine herbs. At full proof, it opens with a fiery flurry of sizzling spices, as cinnamon hearts candies meet sweet candied apple and dense fruitiness—raisin and fig—that evolve to grilled pineapple and melon. (914 bottles)"
1704,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Drayman’s Highveld Single Cask (Cask No. 10), 47%<review>The man behind this whisky is an acclaimed craft brewer, and on the strength of his early efforts this intriguing distillery is going to be winning plaudits from the world of whisky before too long. This single cask bottling steps over the hurdle of youthful sappy barley at its core, thanks to a big dose of wine-influenced spirit, which is liqueur-like; rich, full, and heavily berried. The killer, though, is the way the whisky goes up through the spice gears. €48 (Not available in the U.S.)"
1705,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Knob Creek Single Barrel Reserve (No. 3405), 60%<review>Think caramel bomb. Once you pass the crème brûlée, caramel chew, and other variations of the confectionary, vanilla custard, pumpkin, toasted pecan, raisins, light German chocolate cake, praline, tobacco, cigar box, sandalwood, and earth surface. It’s mouth-coating, covering every inch, tingling from the palate’s roof to the back of the neck. The incredibly long finish sits there with caramel. The only knock here is that caramel can be overwhelming, but it’s also bourbon’s staple note. (New Hampshire only)"
1706,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Lot No. 40 Cask Strength Third Edition, 58%<review>Bottled at natural cask strength and without an age statement, this is clearly all-rye whisky with its lilacs, cloves, and baking spices. Strong hints of caraway point directly to rye, yet suggestions of antiseptic, black licorice, and butterscotch take this iconic dram in new directions. A handful of vocal fans have demanded cask strength, though this Lot 40 begs for water."
1707,"<price>35<rating>81<whiskey>Belgian Dark Strong Style, 45%<review>Nose is tight, closed, what’s there is like a raisin bun; softly sweet pastry and dried fruit. Gentle in the mouth, warming but not hot; still like the pastry, but with oak framing and some nuts and a hint of anise. (375 ml.)"
1708,"<price>160<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Strathisla), 36 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.5%<review>This whisky starts out rich and lush-both in aroma and on the palate, with notes of fig cake, candied fruit, and sticky toffee pudding. Citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine)-a characteristic that emerges with many older whiskies-cuts through the heft and lushness of this whisky, contributing complexity, balance and drinkability. The whisky continues to evolve, serving up notes of almonds, exotic spice, and polished leather on the finish. An excellent example of what a mature, Speyside whisky should taste like. 
"
1709,"<price>30<rating>84<whiskey>Tap 357, 40.5%<review>Nose is full of a wonderful, authentic maple syrup smell with a warming background of whisky. The maple’s there in the mouth, too; not overwhelming, and blending well with the whisky. There’s a good balance here, for what it is, and the finish is clean. If you like maple, this is going to do it: it’s not cloying or thick, and could make a great cocktail with — really — bacon."
1710,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Kaiyō Mizunara Oak, 43%<review>Mizunara oak is the modern signature of Japanese whisky, and Kaiyo- whisky enables inquisitive imbibers to savor the spice, incense, and sandalwood flavors of this rare wood for an attractive price. Distilled and matured in Japan, the casks then undergo a three-month ocean voyage from Osaka to Liverpool before bottling to encourage further flavorsome interactions. Ground spices, vanilla sponge cake, honey, brown sugar cubes, and scents of aromatic woods and incense. Pastry, egg custard, and allspice flavors, followed by a wave of vanilla creaminess and a lengthy finish with fading spices. Number 14 in the 2019 Top 20 "
1711,"<price>936<rating>90<whiskey>Convalmore 36 year old, 58%<review>The last official Convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. Old, and fascinating. (2,980 bottles)"
1712,"<price>261<rating>89<whiskey>Rosebank 21 year old 1990 (Diageo Special Releases 2011), 53.8%<review>2011 saw the first expression of Rosebank appear in Diageo’s annual Special Releases series, and just 5,604 bottles are available worldwide. The bottling is comprised of whisky matured in refill American oak and refill European oak casks. Floral and mildly herbal on the nose, with cereal and tropical fruit notes, along with a hint of damp soil. The palate is somewhat tart, with oranges and pepper, while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. A lovely example of a much-mourned malt. "
1713,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Myths & Legends I, 46%<review>Two parcels of whisky of varying ages from the same Northern Highland distillery were blended together in this expression. Floral on the nose, with ginger biscuits, malt, vanilla, and peach blossom. The palate is voluptuous, with sweet orchard fruits, more malt, and cinnamon spice. Nutty, with cocoa and oak in the ultimately drying finish. (4,394 bottles)"
1714,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Ardbeg Auriverdes, 49.9%<review>This year’s Ardbeg Day bottling is named in tribute to World Cup host Brazil’s national colors: Auri (Gold) and Verdes (Green). Very restrained to start: grassy, sweet with vanilla pod, shoreline, and smoke wrapped in a woolen blanket. The palate shows more smoke, light chocolate, Ardbeg oiliness, and soot. It’s fresh and charming, but ultimately is a quarterfinalist beaten on penalties."
1715,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Ohishi Sakura Cask-Finished, 42.7%<review>
This second batch was sherry matured before a 27–month sakura cask finish; it’s intricate and contemplative. Cherry lozenge, caramelized sugar, black currant, strawberries with cream on puff pastry, rose petal, vanilla icing, apricot, coriander seed, and white pepper, though the aromas can be quite fleeting. The palate glides through gentle honey, strawberry, tingling spices, caramel, stone fruit, light cherry, and hints of red apple. Utterly charming: the Hello Kitty of whiskies. (1,062 bottles)"
1716,"<price>1500<rating>96<whiskey>The Macallan 29 year old 1976 Vintage (Cask #11354), 45.4%<review>Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured, complex, and quite deep, with notes of toffee, ripe pit fruit, raisin, apple pie, dried spice (cinnamon, clove, ginger, and mint), and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional, multi-faceted Macallan!"
1717,"<price>300<rating>95<whiskey>Ardbeg 19 year old Traigh Bhan (Batch 2), 46.2%<review>
The early nose offers hand-rolled tobacco, ginger, black pepper, and fragrant woodsmoke. Medicinal notes, brine, and lemon develop in time. Sweet peat smoke, tropical fruits, toffee, and aniseed on the palate, with smoked haddock and a suggestion of tar. Iodine, black pepper, and sea salt in the lengthy finish."
1718,"<price>140<rating>93<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 14 year old Bottled in Bond (Fall 2020 Release), 50%<review>
Oak-forward and earthy, the nose is dominated by dark cigar wrapper, leather, grain bin, and dry autumn leaves, with overripe peaches and plenty of toasted pecan and walnut lurking just beneath. The palate is full-bodied and chewy, yet displays the softness you’d expect from such a well-aged wheater, as the flavor marries alluring caramel-and-maple sweetness with mixed nuts to achieve perfect balance."
1719,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Royal Brackla 12 year old, 40%<review>As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
The nose offers warm spices, walnuts, malt, peaches in cream, honey, vanilla, and a slightly herbal, earthy note. Quite robust on the palate for its strength, with spice, sweet sherry, and mildly smoky orchard fruit. The finish is relatively long, with cocoa powder, citrus fruit, and ginger."
1720,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Edradour Madeira Finish, 11 year old, 59.6%<review>A mélange of sugared almonds, toffee, sultana, and citrus peel. Firm on the palate, with a nutty, spicy oak finish. Nicely done. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
1721,"<price>68<rating>93<whiskey>Alberta Premium 20 year old, 42%<review>This has the classic sweetish, oily, floral, leathery nose of 100% rye grain whisky. A luxurious, creamy, medium-weight dram with caraway rye bread, restrained but hot peppery spices, vague citrus notes, and hints of cedar setting goal posts for punts of sweet and vaguely floral barley sugar, nail polish (in a good way), caramel, barrel wood, well-aged lumber, dark rye bread, ripe apples, milk chocolate, and baking spices. $90 CAD"
1722,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Oak Cross, 43%<review>Compared to Asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. The nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove."
1723,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Springbank Refill Sherry 17 year old, 57%<review>Even with a refill sherry cask, bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie, red raspberry preserve, red currant. But there’s honeyed malt for balance, along with suggestions of
coconut macaroon, marzipan, brine, and glazed ginger to keep things interesting. Distinctive. (U.S. exclusive)"
1724,"<price>100<rating>96<whiskey>Jameson Pure Pot Still Limited Reserve, 15 year old, 43%<review>Antique gold. It’s the only 'pure pot still' whiskey produced at the Midleton distillery that’s available in the U.S., and its impact on the whiskey is enormous. Its flavors continue to evolve and are perfectly balanced with notes of lush fruit, toffee, fudge, almonds, and vanilla. It finishes long, with mature oak notes that linger. More seductive and not as bold as Jameson Gold. This is the definitive Irish whiskey-it's as simple as that! It will satisfy both Scotch and Irish whiskey drinkers. Don't come whining to me several months from now because you didn't get a bottle! Buy it now while you still can."
1725,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Eades “Double Malt” Highland (Second Edition), 46%<review>Consists of two whiskies: half 10 year old Clynelish (finished in Chateau Lafite casks) and half 10 year old Ben Nevis (finished in Grenache Blanc casks). The classic chewy, nutty toffee notes of Ben Nevis are prominent throughout, while Clynelish’s spicy, briny notes become more prominent mid-palate, peaking on the finish. The two work well together, with the brine and spice cutting through the thick toffee. Bright, berried fruit (from the finishing) adds an additional dimension prominently throughout. Some oak resin kicks in on the finish to keep the whisky from becoming too sappy sweet."
1726,"<price>37<rating>86<whiskey>Pinhook Bourbon Country Straight Bourbon, 47.75%<review>The nose is a medley of bananas and cream, cinnamon-covered apples, and saltwater taffy, with an undernote of new wood. A rich, creamy palate offers dried orange slices, marmalade, dried figs, mince pie, and vanilla cream. The finish has notes of baking spice, vanilla, more dried fruit, and a peppery back note. Delightfully sweet and with good texture following through nicely on the finish. Youthful, but balanced and enjoyable."
1727,"<price>80<rating>95<whiskey>High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram (Act 3), 49.3%<review>This is High West Rendezvous Rye finished in port and French oak barrels. It is a campfire pour. An arsenal of smoke, spice, and sweet, alternating back and forth. Just when you think the nuance ends, pronouncements of chocolate, cinnamon, plum, pepper spice, and barbecue. Its complexity hits a homerun, offering honey, red fruits, and citrus to a lingering, tickling, spicy finish. A must have. Sourced whiskey."
1728,"<price>195<rating>88<whiskey>BenRiach Authenticus 25 year old, 46%<review>Though sounding more like a character out of Asterix than a whisky, Authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding BenRiach portfolio. It’s the smoke that you notice first, typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It’s not a bludgeoning smoke however, because BenRiach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words, it has maturity. The key here is balance and harmony. £124"
1729,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Glendalough 7 year old Black Pitts Porter Barrel Finish, 46%<review>Like two people talking at once; one telling you about the malt biscuit, orange cake, and honey, the other espousing dark chocolate cookies, cocoa powder, and black fruits. It’s an articulate dialogue, not an argument, and they find consensus. Substantial dark chocolate, black fruit, honey, mixed peel, roasted peppery spices, and praline are a treat for the taste buds. Active spices and bitter chocolate conclude the conversation. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)"
1730,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Ledaig 1998 PX Cask Finish, 55.7%<review>Part of Distell’s Malt Collection, this 19 year old offering of Tobermory Distillery’s peated spirit was finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose yields smoky caramel, raisins, and coal soot. Full-bodied, with blackcurrant, toffee, hot asphalt, and black pepper. Black pepper, peat, and chewy oak in the medium-length finish."
1731,"<price>175<rating>86<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Glenglassaugh), 1986 vintage, 20 year old, 55.3%<review>The ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. This whisky is a mouthful: fruitcake, roasted chestnuts, burnt raisin, candied orange, molasses, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, wax, and a hint of clove. An incredible amount of sherry, but it’s not cloying. The flavors are clean, complex, and well-balanced.
"
1732,"<price>58<rating>86<whiskey>Kilkerran Work In Progress 5 Bourbon, 46%<review>The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38 "
1733,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>High West Campfire, 46%<review>This hybrid of bourbon, rye, and blended malt scotch is the dusty trail made liquid flesh. Smoke and cooked meat up front, balanced by sizzling rye spice, red fruit, and dark chocolate. Seaweed, salt spray, and peat are happy to share the spotlight. Barbecue ribs dry-rubbed with paprika, chili powder, and clove, with a smoldering finish. Hot, powerful, and beguiling. A great improvement over earlier releases (2016 batch)."
1734,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Octave The Huntly 1998 19 year old, 53.3%<review>This is really intriguing, with the vitality of fresh green shoots in spring, fresh-mown lawns, snow peas, pencil shavings, dragon fruit, beet chips, and the exotic scents of a spice market. The taste is gentle with lime, herbal notes, cream soda, generous buttery caramel, and some boisterous spices that loiter into the finish. A highly enjoyable bottle: one to dissect, discuss, and digest."
1735,"<price>91<rating>82<whiskey>Master of Malt Reference Series II, 47.5%<review>This laudable effort of comparative whiskies explores the effect of age by combining four parcels of stock in different proportions. The older whiskies produce an enticing nose of marmalade-encrusted ham on the bone, grist, and worn sandpaper. It’s sugary sweet with ripe melon before the sherry takes control and dishes out cherry candy and papaya. Held in the mouth, it develops layers of creamy latte and milk chocolate as the fruit fades. More to get your teeth into here. £54"
1736,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Slaughter House American Whiskey, 44%<review>Blend of 5 and 9 year old whiskeys aged in American oak and finished in Papillion (a French oak-aged red wine) barrels. There’s something to this, with orange zest, rose petals, honey, vanilla, and cotton candy. Then, a contradictory array of flavors abruptly changes the conversation. Think smoke: charcoal, campfire marshmallows, cinnamon, with hints of white pepper and tobacco plug. Its medium-spicy finish captivates me, even though palate and nose seem to be two different whiskeys. Very interesting. Sourced whiskey."
1737,"<price>88<rating>85<whiskey>BenRiach Maderensis Fumosis (Madeira Wood Finish) 13 year old, 46%<review>Sounds more like a disease than a whisky. A peated version of BenRiach, with the tarry smoke melding nicely with toffee, bramble, and rhubarb. Lingering earthy smoke on the finish and slightly tannic, with subtle fruit. Good mouthfeel on this one."
1738,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>anCnoc Cutter, 46%<review>Part of anCnoc’s Peaty Collection, Cutter has been distilled from malt peated to 20.5 ppm. The result is a dram with a nose of ashy peat and medicine cabinets, backed by vanilla and canned apricots. Rich peat on the palate, with citrus fruit and crème brûlée. The slightly oily finish is long and bonfire-like."
1739,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Exclusive Blend 1991 21 year old, 46%<review>From whisky connoisseur David Stirk's Exclusive Malts Single Cask Cask Strength range, this is a blend made with 80% malt, and it shows. This is a beauty. It's also a ‘traffic light’ whisky, with the sort of whisky rancio associated with the oldest whiskies up front, peaches and cream and pureed fruit in the center, and changing to oaky spiciness late on. Whisky with body, depth, and balance, which morph seamlessly. Very good indeed."
1740,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Forty Creek Confederation Oak Lot 1867-I, 40%<review>Vague fruitiness, barrel notes, and corncobs on the nose turn to lush caramels, with a plush mouthfeel punctuated by hints of rye spices that become more assertive as notes of cloves meld into candy cane on a long, spicy, then pithy finish. There is more fruit in this special Canada 150 edition of Confederation Oak—sweet ripe apples and tart gooseberries. A masterful example of blending."
1741,"<price>45<rating>95<whiskey>High West Rendezvous Rye (Batch #10), 46%<review>A blend of two whiskeys; a 6 year old made from 95% rye and a 16 year old made from 80% rye.  These are very high percentages; a straight rye whiskey only needs to contain 51% rye to meet the definition.  It was very clever to marry the vibrancy of a younger whiskey with the depth of a mature whiskey.  Thanks to the high rye content, this whiskey is very spicy, with cinnamon, crisp mint, and fennel.  Underlying sweet notes of caramel, molasses, vanilla, macaroon, cocoa, and candied fruit provide a calming effect and enhance the whiskey's complexity.  But in the end, the rye is the victor, emerging with a vengeance and giving the whisky a bold, warming, spice finish."
1742,"<price>68<rating>89<whiskey>Tweeddale 12 year old Batch 3, 46%<review>Alasdair Day is on a mission to build a new Lowland distillery in the Borders of Scotland. While we wait, the next batch from his grandfather’s cellar book is a pale, golden dram with a delectable nose of lemon meringue pie, spring blossoms, peach pit, candy floss, and Valrhona Ivoire white chocolate. This is more-ish whisky: like spooning into panna cotta. Pear syrup, white chocolate, and a sizzle of toasted muffins dissipate into a mild ginger and gooseberry finish. £40"
1743,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Four Roses Mariage Collection (2009 Release), 57-59%<review>A combination of 10 and 19 year old bourbons from two different recipes. Very spicy, but no excessive oak (given the 19 year old component). Still, there’s definitely more oak than last year’s release, and maybe more than I would like for balance. Along with the cinnamon, cool mint, cocoa powder, and nutmeg, there are caramelized sugars and bright citrus notes. This is a tight whiskey -- not heavy and lethargic, like some 10-plus year old bourbons can be. The flavors are crisp and vibrant, all the way to its polished oak, tobacco-tinged finish."
1744,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Jefferson’s 10 year old Batch 18, 47%<review>Whiffs of whole cloves quickly turn to cedar shavings, acetone, menthol horse liniment, corn syrup, and German rye bread. Brighter and fresher than other 100% ryes, but somehow a bit muddied with a grainy, earthy, wet-clay mealiness. Searing spices turn rye drinking into an extreme sport. Leather, peppermint, sweetish rye grain, and firewood gradually emerge. A blistering finish pulls like tannic black tea, while underlying rye grain notes drift along forever."
1745,"<price>47<rating>94<whiskey>Ardbeg 5 year old Wee Beastie, 47.4%<review>

The youthful age statement may take many scotch drinkers by surprise, but don’t let double-digit bias prevent you from enjoying this exciting yet easy-drinking peat bomb. Salt water and seaweed, smoke and sweet peat tussle on the nose, while vanilla, fresh berries, and ample nuttiness spread out and take hold. The structured, balanced palate is creamy, nutty, and spiced, showcasing brown-sugar bacon, smoked salt, milk chocolate, pepper, and well-integrated oak, all wrapped up like a cigar with flakes of ash and sustained smoke. This precocious youngster shows more complexity than some whiskies twice its age, making it a remarkable find. Number 6 in the 2020 Top 20"
1746,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Lagavulin 11 year old Offerman Edition, 46%<review>Saline, smoke, seaweed, and iodine mingle with biscuity shortbread, lemon, bubble gum, bright berry fruit, and wafting floral aromas. The palate glides silkily from lemon, orange, and soapy-floral flavors to almonds, hazelnuts, drying oak, and hints of ginger, with peat smoke and salt weaving throughout. Sweet, then bitter on the finish, showcasing cigar ash, leather, and polished oak. Actor Nick Offerman, who collaborated with the distillery on this single malt, could hardly be described as reticent, but his whisky has a sweet shyness that works well in the glass"
1747,"<price>228<rating>87<whiskey>Miyagikyo 1999 single cask, 61%<review>Herbal-style Miyagikyo, with light balsa wood opening into macaroon and peach stone. The sense, especially with water, is of early autumn unfolding. The palate is very soft, with the assured boldness of character typical of the distillery, but tempered with a subtle undertow of persimmon and peach. Sweet and lush, but with delicacy. €169"
1748,"<price>22<rating>84<whiskey>PennyPacker, 40%<review>A straightforward bourbon with no flaws. Nicely balanced flavors of fruit (mandarin, apricot, pineapple), gentle sweetness  (honey, vanilla, caramel), and soft spice (cinnamon, mint). Gentle finish. Nice enough to drink straight in a pinch, but it comes across as more of a mixing bourbon to me."
1749,"<price>22<rating>85<whiskey>Sir Edward’s Smoky, 40%<review>This blend delivers just enough peat turf to live up to the name, without alienating the peat phobics. A pleasant nose of chocolate hazelnut, pecan nut, dried tropical fruits, and gentle wood and peat smoke.  Orange, toffee, banoffee pie, Kola Kubes, and a little spiciness. Plenty of flavor even if the mouthfeel is a little thin. A short finish with a spicy flare and a few lingering smoky embers. (Total Wine exclusive) Price per 1.75 liter"
1750,"<price>40<rating>94<whiskey>Lot No. 40, 43%<review>Corby’s latest Lot 40, this one undated, comes from the same distillation batch as the 2012 release, but with a couple of extra years in wood. The familiar flavors are all there: dustiness, sour rye, hard wet slate, floral notes, exotic fruits, sweet spices, and biting white pepper. Over these, time has sprinkled licorice root, dried dates, oatmeal porridge, vanilla, hints of bike tires, and mango peels. Flavors remain fully integrated with faint tannins underscoring a long sour-rye finish. Value Pick."
1751,"<price>74<rating>84<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Caledonian) 29 year old, 47.7%<review>As young a Caledonian as you’ll find; I found the nose rather underdeveloped. Crystallized lemon slices, green banana, solvents, dry grasses, and a sniff of nail polish remover. In the mouth, lemon flavors, saccharine sweet honey, and banana dipped in melted chocolate, while the alcohol nips at the tongue. A good trajectory redeems its character, leaving deep throbbing spice notes in the finish, with bitter citrus at the fringes."
1752,"<price>43<rating>86<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Lossit, 43%<review>The stills ran cold in this lost Islay distillery at Ballygrant in the 1860s. Excitingly acrid smoke on the nose: like fireworks or the smoking muzzle of a rifle mingled with summer lemons and crunchy green pear. Poached pears in cream, greengages, and peppercorns meet a stealthy, sour gooseberry takeover. Fades to a chalky, sour fruit plateau before a chili heat finish."
1753,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Sea Fog Straight Rye, 45%<review>Distilled in 2014, this is the first rye from Rhode Island’s Newport Craft Brewing and Distilling. Lemon and potpourri start things off on the nose, followed by appealing notes of dried seaweed, seashells, licorice, peat, and wood char. The palate is rich and full-bodied; along with the finish, it offers lemon pie, espresso, herbs, more peat, and barrel char. Bold, spicy, and earthy, but also refined and balanced at the same time. (1,110 bottles)"
1754,"<price>47<rating>86<whiskey>Timorous Beastie 10 year old, 46.8%<review>Soft and floral with perfumed lavender soap, peach, green apple, and parma violets. It floats in the mouth, dispensing flavors of sweet apple, custard, tangy tangerine, hard candies, green plum, marshmallow, and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished, but there’s an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday, rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. £35"
1755,"<price>151<rating>93<whiskey>Ballantine’s 21 year old Golden Zest, 40%<review>Perhaps the most alluring name ever given to a whisky, this has a nose of bright, zesty, potent clementine with vanilla sponge cake, fudge, heady floral scents, toasted coriander seeds, and peppercorn. Citrus drives the palate, but it’s sweet and tangy, and arrives with vanilla, fudge, toffee, and twinkling little flights of spice. Brilliant blending and the tastiest exploration of Ballantine’s signature notes to date. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
1756,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead's, (distilled at Blair Athol), 1989, 58.1%<review>Pale gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a holiday spice cake-ginger, cinnamon, honey, and a touch of citrus fruit. Medium bodied, but it coats the palate-there's some viscosity here. The flavors are rather soothing and very much like its aroma, with a malty sweetness throughout and a lingering finish.
   Style: Highland single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $80s. Limited availability. 
   The owners of Blair Athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the U.S. For this reason it can be rather difficult to find, only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. This particular expression is a very good example from this distillery."
1757,"<price>225<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila 25 year old, 59.4%<review>A rounded and mature affair. The 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. All the classic Caol Ila notes are stillthere-mustard, seaweed, olives, damp peat, salt and pepper. A touch of vanilla wafer, anise, smoked almonds, and tarry rope add complexity. Those of you who prefer Ardbeg 17 over the 10, and Laphroaig 15 over the 10, will be attracted to this whisky when compared to Caol Ila's younger siblings. But at $225, it's an expensive date, isn't it?"
1758,"<price>140<rating>87<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at BenRiach) 17 year old 1997 (cask #144744), 54.3%<review>BenRiach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here, we have an unpeated, non-barrel finish release. The nose is inviting, with Honeycrisp apple, toffee, malt, and a touch of oak. A very flavorful entry presents lush toffee, apple, malt, and ginger. The spice increases in the mid-palate, as well as the heat, but we don’t get much added complexity. A long, flavorful, and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky. (U.S. only)"
1759,"<price>585<rating>91<whiskey>Redbreast Dream Cask 32 year old, 46.5%<review>Bursting with hawthorn, red currant, cherry, pomegranate, baked sugar sweetness, roasted spices, cardamom, dark honey, and plum pudding. This pot still whiskey from 1985 is mouth drawing with fruit flesh and skins, tasting of stewed fruits, baked orange, apple, and pomegranate, with a very fine shimmer of spices that sparkles on the tongue. Adding to their canon of single cask Redbreast releases, this is absolutely smashing. €500"
1760,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>Often overlooked by collectors because it’s not as high in alcohol as most of its siblings, it’s superior to last year’s release, which I felt brandished more oak on the finish than needed. Caramel, rhum agricole, golden raisin, and dried citrus segue into polished oak, along with a wisp of honey and cinnamon on the finish. Well rounded and subtly complex. An exceptional bourbon. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016."
1761,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Tasters’ Selection Barrel-Proof Straight Rye (Selection #004), 63.8%<review>Part of the Tennessee Tasters’ Selection series, this rye was matured in barrels located at the top of barrel house #1-05 in Lynchburg. The nose offers custard, coffee cake, bitter orange, orchard fruit, spice, and toasty oak. Candied apple and orange fill the palate, along with black cherries, cinnamon bread, and pepper. Green apple, dark chocolate, and raisins mark the finish. Water or ice recommended. (Available at the distillery and in Tennessee only)"
1762,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel #17E866), 55.3%<review>Exudes a tantalizing and heady aroma of baking spices, crème brûlée, and toasted oak, with Nilla Wafers and Jordan almonds lending confectionary notes. The oily mouthfeel and chewy viscosity are powerful yet balanced, as the lovely caramelized sweetness of grilled pound cake meets blackberry, lemon oil, ginger, and flickers of allspice. Focused and seamless in its rich tapestry of flavors. Editors’ Choice"
1763,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>Arran Premium Bourbon Single Cask (Cask 2096), 52%<review>This U.S.-exclusive Premium Bourbon Single cask #2096 contrasts nicely with its sherry cask-matured sibling, and offers vanilla, cocoa powder, malt extract, ripe bananas, and spicy sultanas on the nose. The palate is smooth and spicy, with ginger snaps and developing butteriness. The finish is medium to long, with chili notes and citrus fruits at the last. "
1764,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Abraham Bowman Pioneer Spirit Virginia Whiskey (distilled 1993, bottled 2011), 69.3%<review>Distilled at Buffalo Trace in Kentucky but aged mostly in Virginia at the A. Smith Bowman distillery. This is a bold, hearty bourbon: not elegant or refined, rather a bit mean and moody at times. Sweeter, gentler notes of vanilla, caramel, nougat, mocha, and candied fruit wrestle with more aggressive tobacco, leather, and damp forest floor notes. Warming, cinnamon-tinged, gripping finish. A rewarding whiskey for those with an adventurous soul."
1765,"<price>48<rating>72<whiskey>Feisty Spirits Better Days Bourbon, 44%<review>Aged for “at least” one month, this bourbon is a collaboration with the band Fierce Dead Rabbit. Better Days is pale gold and noticeably cloudy. On the nose it’s paste, yeasty bread dough, and wet pavement. On the palate it is all over the place with raw oak, cinnamon, almond, and black pepper. There's no balance and no integration. The finish is short, hot, and dry. As whiskey ages, it goes through odd, awkward phases, and that's where this one is."
1766,"<price>110<rating>88<whiskey>Arran Malt 16 year old, 46%<review>As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish."
1767,"<price>27<rating>85<whiskey>Wigle Wheat White Ash (Small Cask Series), 46%<review>Wigle’s also doing a series of finishing experiments with the addition of honeycombed wood chunks to their organic wheat whiskey; this one uses white ash. Sweeter nose than the straight-up wheat whiskey (see below); mouth is cleaner, and the astringency I noted on the end is ameliorated. All a matter of degrees though; quite similar to the regular wheat whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
1768,"<price>19<rating>87<whiskey>Sadler’s Peaky Blinder Blended Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>Named after the infamous gang that weaponized their flat caps by stitching razor blades into the peaks, this whiskey threatens a nose of raisin, banana bread, Irish soda bread, beer mash, and dark honey. A lightweight mouthfeel, with dried apple, baked goods, oat bars, vanilla extract, and pancakes slathered with maple syrup, a spicy swallow, and a finish of burnt fruitcake. An easy-drinking whiskey."
1769,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Pike Creek 21 year old European Oak Finish, 45%<review>After blending, 21 year old Canadian whisky was finished in French and Hungarian oak barrels for added zest. This brought hints of nutmeg and candied Christmas cake fruits to berries, green fruits, pineapple, kiwi, spearmint, lush caramels, exotic wood, charred firewood, applewood, and lovely clean barrel notes. Glowing heat, leather, tobacco, furniture polish, and a creamy body. Beautifully complex, peppery, and balanced. (Canada exclusive) $100 CAD"
1770,"<price>100<rating>96<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle 15 year old Family Reserve, 53.5%<review>Sometime recently, the source of this whiskey changed from the now defunct Stitzel-Weller distillery to Buffalo Trace. No matter. This whiskey is still the best of the Van Winkle line. It’s crisp, clean, vibrant, impeccably balanced, and nicely matured. Complex fruit (bramble, candied citrus), caramel, coconut custard, maple syrup, fresh spice (vanilla, warming cinnamon, nutmeg, a dusting of cocoa powder) on a bed of nougat. Outstanding! (Editor's Choice)"
1771,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Tomintoul 16 year old, 40%<review>The ""Gentle Dram,"" it says on the bottle’s label, and it certainly is one of the gentler whiskies in Speyside. It’s a fragrant whisky too with a firm malty foundation, fruit gum drops and caramel. Subtle notes of almond and anise helped keep my interest, as did its soft, subtle wood spice finish. Very easy to drink too!"
1772,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Tommyrotter Napa Valley Heritage Cask Bourbon, 47.5%<review>A bowl of sweet, fresh cherries greets you on the nose, the result of the Napa cabernet cask-finishing, and it melds well with notes of lemon zest, chocolate, and a hint of smoky charcoal. The palate delivers more cherry as well as strawberries, which combine with marshmallow and whipped cream, and the finish has plenty of length. It’s a bouquet of chocolate and berries, with impressive subtlety and complexity."
1773,"<price>38<rating>87<whiskey>Pinhook Bohemian Kentucky Straight, 47.5%<review>
The initial herbal, grainy, and slightly grassy nose betrays some youth here, but there is still a lot to like, as roasted nuts, floral aromas, and nicely integrated toasty oak come to the rescue. A medium-bodied palate delivers lots of sweetness that smacks of honey and pureed pears, remaining fresh and lively with gentle spice on the finish."
1774,"<price>120<rating>94<whiskey>Chivas Regal 18 year old Ultimate Cask Collection First Fill French Oak Finish, 48%<review>An auld alliance renewed, this gorgeous whisky packs spicy aromas of peppercorn, star anise, and cardamom seeds, mingling with toffee squares, plum jam, dunnage earth, and dried sprigs of heather. Rich fruitcake, jellied fruit, and bramble, then spices course through the mouth: chili heat, black pepper, and raw ginger. Final phase has chocolate praline, growing milky, nutty, and soothing. Exceptional lengthy finish with reignited spices. Chivas 18 goes electric. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
1775,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>High West Valley Tan (Batch #3), 43.5%<review>Wheat has been swapped for oats in this release, but the agenda remains the same, a very primary whiskey with grain at the forefront and just a hint of oak roundness to the surprisingly creamy palate. Fresh flour, violet candies, hints of clove spice, and persistent sweetness, the palate gives the impression of warm breakfast cereal laced with banana and lemon, a testament to the quality of the distillate."
1776,"<price>63<rating>84<whiskey>Balblair 2002, 46%<review>This 2002 expression of Balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. It is naturally colored and non-chill filtered, in line with the rest of the Balblair range, and has been matured in bourbon barrels. Fizzy lemonade, banana skins, and violets on the nose, with soft caramel developing in time. Fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate, with ripe apples and vanilla. Long, floral, and lively in the finish. £40"
1777,"<price>400<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984, 50.7%<review>Surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate, but also oozing with character. Best neat."
1778,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>High West Campfire Barrel Finish, 46%<review>A blend of bourbon, rye, and peated single malt Scotch whiskies. This is an adaptation of the original release that spent additional time in Hungarian and French oak barrels. The finishing produces a creamier, smoother, more rounded, more mature, and improved version of Campfire, showing notes of honey, vanilla, dark berries, soft mint, and smoke. Distinctive and unique."
1779,"<price>190<rating>90<whiskey>Tweeddale Last Centennial, 52.2%<review>A limited edition cask strength blend of four single casks by Alasdair Day released to mark 100 years since the last entry in their blender’s historic cellar book. The nose has warm caramel, whole orange, and a dry, grassy, and gristy note. Rich orange envelops the mouth with golden caramel, shortbread, and underlying spices of ginger and pepper. Takes water well and retains its character; lots to like here."
1780,"<price>285<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich 1973 vintage, 40.2%<review>This one is my favorite of the four distillery-bottled Bruichladdich whiskies reviewed here. It still quite lively and nicely balanced for such a mature whisky (and reminiscent of the previous 1970 vintage in this respect), with some floral notes and brine emerging from its fruity, vanilla, truffle, nougat foundation. Still, it maintains an air of lightness and freshness throughout, with a pleasingly dry, subtly spicy finish that lingers."
1781,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Old Masters Freemason Whisky, 40%<review>Originally created by Lombard for the Freemasons, this has a flavorsome nose of dark chocolate chip cookies, light spices, coconut macaroons, malt, and bright, fresh bananas. The palate is light and unobtrusive, with honey and malt reinforced by the spices running underneath. A shift develops to some later cocoa and chocolate notes, and the mocha finish fades gracefully. A finely balanced concoction, and you will rarely find this quality and flavor for the price"
1782,"<price>69<rating>83<whiskey>The English Whisky Co. Chapter 15 Limited Edition, 46%<review>Here, talented distiller David Fitt shows us his latest expression of heavily peated whisky. The nose has jalapeño and bell peppers, with pungent peat smoke that catches at the back of the throat. The smoke is sooty coal dust buoyed with some sweetness, but without a medicinal edge to the phenols. Sipping brought lemon bonbons, herbal elements, and some burnt toast character. It swells out in the middle before relenting, leaving a quenching, sweet finish and a smoky aura. £45"
1783,"<price>80<rating>93<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach), 11 year old,k 1993 vintage, 60.7%<review>Full-flavored, confident, and very dynamic. Bright fruit, teasing toffee, complex spices, cereal grain, and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. Think an 11 year old whisky can’t be mature or complex? Think again! A Speyside powerhouse! (Available in the Chicago area.) 
"
1784,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Bushmills Black Bush, 40%<review>This is the whiskey that introduces the American journalist to Belfast drinking culture in Colin Bateman’s Divorcing Jack. The sherry cask maturation is the key; mouthwatering autumn fruits plucked from the trees, cinnamon-apple cobbler, and cocoa-dusted raisins. A smooth, glistening dram from the North Antrim coast; weighty and fruity, the sweetness turning to raisin chocolate bars. There is a lot to bite on. It slips away reluctantly, leaving a long, dark sweetness behind it. One glass is never enough."
1785,"<price>1000<rating>96<whiskey>Yamazaki Mizunara Cask 18 year old (2017 Edition), 48%<review>When whisky lovers talk about the grandeur of Japanese whisky, the enlightenment they desire can be found within this bottle. A refined luxury evocative of toasted marshmallow, sweet incense, butter-soft caramels, oak spices, and ground cinnamon. All the hallmarks of mizunara are here. Concentrated sweet citrus, so intensely fruity on the palate; the mouthfeel is rapturously silky with touches of mango, dried apricot, and gentle but resilient spices."
1786,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Clyde May’s Straight Rye, 47%<review>Generous proof and just 3 years of age mean this is no wallflower whiskey. Peppermint, white flowers, leather, and Pine-Sol aromas turn gingery on the palate, revealing bold rye spice, root beer, licorice, cinnamon sticks, and pine boughs. Good intensity, if a touch brash."
1787,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Cuatro Series Oloroso, 46%<review>The nose opens with savory notes. Richer, more fragrant and profound sherry than is present in the Fino or Manazanilla expressions. Full-bodied, with big, musty sherry notes and Seville oranges on the palate, plus lots of spice. Gum-tingling spices, with sultanas and dates in the finish."
1788,"<price>32<rating>78<whiskey>Quincy Street Bourbon Spring, 44%<review>Plainly states it’s “aged four months in a small oak barrel.” Tame nose; working hard to pull out anything other than alcohol heat, some fresh-cut wet wood, and wet cereal. Quite hot, with lots of wet oak sawdust and sweet cinnamon that rocket right into the finish. Reminds me of a young teenager, running around, shouting at inappropriate moments, and very excited. Too young and hot right now. Put it back in the barrel; maybe a larger one. Price is per 375 ml."
1789,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>Last Mountain Private Reserve, 45%<review>Distiller Colin Schmidt is earning his blending chops honestly, using sourced whiskies to keep the cash flow positive while his own distillate matures. Sweet burned wood underpins rich dried fruit, hints of crisp oak, butterscotch pudding, and sour gooseberries. Hot pepper and cinnamon enliven a syrupy mouthfeel as the palate broadens into warm, clean earth and dry, weathered barn board. A long, lingering burn finishes in tingling ginger ale and candied citrus peel. (Distillery only) C$50"
1790,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 10 year old, 50%<review>Very powerful and quite different from the 10 year old, 46% bottling reviewed below; this tastes as if it is taken entirely from bourbon oak-aged Springbank. There’s fresh brine, creamy vanilla, honey, and coconut throughout, and it lacks the waxed fruit nature of its sibling. Mouthcoating in texture, with a long appetizing briny finish. Very clean -- and quite polished too, for such a powerful whisky. My choice of the three."
1791,"<price>239<rating>85<whiskey>Octomore Islay Barley 2009, 64%<review>An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150"
1792,"<price>65<rating>83<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Stratheden (batch 2/2), 46%<review>Slabs of plain chocolate, Kendal mint cake, vanilla essence, and malt with a dry, dusty character makes this suggest itself for an after-dinner occasion. The palate is very sweet; sugarplum, caramelized brown sugar, flapjacks, bramble, and pink rhubarb before it finally coagulates into a thick Horlicks maltiness. There’s an impressive trajectory of flavor here, though the mouthfeel is nothing special and dilution doesn’t enhance it to any real degree. Dry and malty finish."
1793,"<price>171<rating>89<whiskey>Cragganmore 20 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 55.8%<review>
Cream, vanilla, and fresh orange juice feature on the early nose, followed by a slightly herbal note. Ultimately sweet and floral, with nougat. Luscious sweet orange notes on the palate, with toasted cereal, before dry wood spices appear. The finish is relatively long and nutty, with a sprinkling of pepper."
1794,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan 15 year old Fine Oak, 43%<review>This is my favorite of the three. For about $20 more, you get a richer, much more complex whisky than the 10 year old, and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. This 15 is drier than the 10, with lovely floral and spice notes (cinnamon, coriander, dried orange peel, lavender, rose), balanced by honey-laced complex fruit, and a dry, dark chocolate/orange marmalade finish."
1795,"<price>79<rating>88<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Gold Label Reserve, 40%<review>Beeswax candles, wafers in vanilla ice cream, dried apricots, a strand of garden bonfire smoke, dried-out wedges of honeydew melon, and fruit shortcake cookies. The palate revels in barley sugar, active spices, lime, orange, and grapefruit peel, and it’s beautifully weighted with fudge and vanilla sponge cake. A mouth-clinging finish saturates the taste buds with sweet, honeyed fruits."
1796,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Tobermory 21 year old, 53.8%<review>Like its Ledaig stablemate, this Tobermory is offered non-chill filtered at cask strength. Finishing occurred in manzanilla sherry casks. Orange marmalade, nutmeg, and developing vanilla on the nose. Full bodied, with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices, aniseed, and developing tannins. Lingering in the finish, with spicy plain chocolate. Ultimately, the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note."
1797,"<price>62<rating>92<whiskey>Wilderness Trail Settlers Select Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Barrel Proof Rye, 48.5%<review>Orange, banana, and nutmeg lead on the nose, along with a subtle note of cigar box. A smooth, chocolaty palate melds with maple syrup, caramel, allspice, and more tobacco. Water brings out heat and more spiciness, with orange and chocolate notes reprising on a long finish. The ABV here is lower than most barrel-proof whiskeys, but make no mistake: this one can stand up to the best of them."
1798,"<price>106<rating>81<whiskey>Kornog Sant Ivy 2016, 59.1%<review>Lemon lozenges and chewy warm cookies, with muscular, brutish smoke characteristics; like standing too close to the open doors of a peat kiln. The palate begins with gooseberries; very sharp, sour, and acidic, the blistering alcohol rolling through like a steamroller, while ginger and pepper fly about like sparks off a grindstone. It is enjoyably mollified through dilution to suggest sponge cake, citrus, chocolate, and tobacco notes. The consummate Kornog can be divine, but this is hard core. €100"
1799,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. Special Reserve 12 year old, 40%<review>This blends bourbon and oloroso cask-matured elements drawn from every style of Irish whiskey. A mouthwatering dram with warm, creamy toffee, ripening yellow banana, wood spices, toasted coconut, spiced stewed apple, and cinnamon sticks. A delicious sip reveals a smooth medley of malt, chocolate, gentle spices, Brazil nut, and dried fruit, which sidles into a long finish of chocolate-covered raisins and deep, resonating spice. No reservations; this is special."
1800,"<price>600<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie 25 year old, 43%<review>This is the oldest regular bottling from Glenmorangie. It offers peaches in cream, honey, and almonds on the elegant yet relatively substantial nose. Tropical fruit on the smooth, full palate, with cinnamon, chocolate cake, and a long finish of dried fruit and tangy oak. Expensive compared to the 18 year old, which scores closely."
1801,"<price>265<rating>88<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Clynelish) 21 year old, 52.5%<review>Distilled in October 1995, this single cask was aged in a refill hogshead (#10206). Primrose, ginger, cedar spice, and malt on the nose, with a hint of salt and background heather; complex. Slightly oily on the palate, with orchard fruits, milk chocolate, a suggestion of brine, and developing cloves. Dries quite rapidly in the finish, with more cloves and light oak tannins. (190 bottles)"
1802,"<price>89<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank Rundlets & Kilderkins, 49.4%<review>Springbank has released a limited edition of 9,000 bottles of whisky distilled in November 2001, matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins), and bottled in January 2012. The small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity, with coal smoke, cloves, young oak, and caramel on the rich nose. The palate is big and bold, with a sprinkling of salt, then more youthful wood, milk chocolate, and honey, while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57"
1803,"<price>200<rating>82<whiskey>Talisker, 20 year old, 59.7%<review>Style: Highland (Isle of Skye) single malt scotch Color: Antique amber Aroma: Toffee, cookies fresh from the oven, waxy ripe fruit, bonfire smoke and damp peat, with background notes of pepper, brine, smoked kippers, and a hint of seaweed. Palate: Similar to its aroma. Full-bodied and quite thick in texture. Dry, smoky, peppery finish.

1804,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig Càirdeas Cask Strength Triple Wood (2019 Release), 59.5%<review>This was first matured in bourbon barrels, then in quarter casks, and finally in European oak oloroso casks. The nose is rich, with iodine-soaked peat, barbecued meat, almonds, toffee, vanilla, and orange. More peat, then orange on the palate, with cigar smoke, dried fruits, cloves, and sea salt. The finish is lengthy and spicy, with orange peel and dark chocolate. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
1805,"<price>350<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park 21 year old (November 2019 Release), 46%<review>This latest release comprises the contents of nine first-fill European sherry-seasoned oak hogsheads, eight bourbon barrels, and nine refill casks, all laid down in 1998. Hints of warm machine oil and herbs on the nose, with pineapple, barley sugar, and white pepper, plus a touch of heather and faint smokiness. Slightly bitter on the palate, with wood spices, while fruitiness lurks in the background. Peppery oak char and coal in the finish."
1806,"<price>120<rating>86<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol lla) 2000, 54.4%<review>Identifiably Caol Ila, with that light juniper note, lime, and very calm smoke. This sense of control continues as it opens very slowly into vanilla/cream with a little hint of salt, then fresh lychee. It is hot, so do water as this introduces a massively salty retro-nasal effect under which is this sweetly gentle mid-palate. Lovely balance."
1807,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Manhattan Moonshine Prohibition-Style Whiskey, 47.5%<review>It’s hard to stand out in a sea of fairly bland moonshine, but Manhattan Moonshine manages to by moving beyond corn in their mashbill, with oat, rye, spelt, and malt. The result is an unaged whiskey that’s light, slightly sweet, and a symphony of cereal grains. The addition of the honey note from the oats is spot on and helps unite the grain flavors. A dash of spice creates balance and drives a dry finish. This is a wonderfully crafted and unique whiskey."
1808,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Laphroaig 10 year old Cask Strength (Batch 010), 58%<review>Bottling at cask strength, with only ‘barrier filtering’ to remove particles of char, rather than the standard chill-filtration process, gives the whisky greater integrity, with heightened aromas and flavors, and a satisfyingly sinewy mouthfeel not found in the standard 10 year old. Classic ‘burning hospital’ notes feature on the nose, along with peaty malt, vanilla, lemon, and brine. Charcuterie and cocoa powder add to the effect on the palate, before phenolic, medicinal, and sweet malt notes bring things to a close. A must-have Laphroaig that represents a big step up in intensity. Number 7 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
1809,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Pure Scot Virgin Oak 43, 43%<review>Bladnoch master distiller Ian MacMillan’s blend is worth seeking out for its appealing freshness; green apple, caramel, shaved oak, toasted whole-grain bread, warm pastries, and dried peels. The palate is awash with bright flavors of honey, walnut, barley sugar, gingerbread in custard, orange taffy candy, and a little spice. It squeezes out more juicy peel oils the more you taste. The conclusion has sweet honey, gingerbread crumbs, and a citrus intensity."
1810,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Tyrconnell 16 year old Oloroso & Moscatel Cask Finished, 46%<review>Sweet sherry with a heady spring floral intensity, lemon, honey, and graham crackers, yet delicate as a dandelion seed in a summer breeze. The palate is seductively sweet, with honey, effervescent lemon sherbet, caramel, and spices, showing a little more of the wine, fruit, and hints of citrus. Distinctively different, the finish is initially drying, then the fruit returns with a grapefruit peel sharpness. Terrifically good dram. (18,000 bottles) Editors’ Choice"
1811,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1979 Vintage, 43%<review>Amber color. Lush, rich aromas of rummy toffee, nuts, vanilla, with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. On the heavy side of medium in body, and silky. There are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee, caramel, marzipan and dates), becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. Long, dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit. 
"
1812,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Bowmore 16 year old 1989 vintage, 51.8%<review>No frills here, just pure, unadulterated Bowmore. This Islay whisky speaks of its location in a very pure and natural way. I find invigorating brine, seaweed, green olive, and fishnets, along with the classic Bowmore peat smoke. All these flavors are softened by gentle vanilla and honeyed malt, while background tropical fruit add complexity. 
"
1813,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Auchentoshan 12 year old, 40%<review>This staple bottling is aged primarily in bourbon barrels, along with a modest portion from sherry casks. The nose yields tropical fruit, hazelnuts, caramelized sugar, and cereal notes. On the palate there’s barley, vanilla, coconut milk, a hint of sherry, light oak, and ginger. The medium-length finish offers black tea and black pepper. An ideal stepping-stone from bourbon to single malt scotch. Best Values"
1814,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>Barrell Cask Strength Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 025), 56.7%,<review>
This basks in beautiful baking spices—clove, nutmeg, and cinnamon—with toasty oak and candle wax hinting at its maturity. The palate is wonderfully dense with fruit, including flavors of marmalade, strawberry jam, and bright tropical fruits, woven with more spice. Even with water the richness and viscosity stand tall, as more caramel and butterscotch emerge. The spellbinding finish is long, sweet, and nutty. Editors' Choice"
1815,"<price>200<rating>85<whiskey>Glenfarclas 27 year old 1981 Vintage (Cask #128), 53.4%<review>When I toured Glenfarclas in May 2008, George Grant told me that, while it is usually not their policy to stray from aging their whisky in sherry and bourbon oak casks, they have done some experimenting. One of these experiments, aged entirely in a port cask, has finally been bottled. The nice thing about Glenfarclas is that it is a rich spirit and can stand up to a good dose of port wine (or sherry for that matter). The port notes are lush, with ripe fruit (plum, red grape skin, caramelized apricot, prune) and dates complementing the whisky’s malty, maple syrup foundation. The 27 years also impart a good dose of polished oak for balance. Not as complex as other Glenfarclas whiskies of this age, but this is certainly a solid, enjoyable change of pace for Glenfarclas. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"

The palate is chock-full of rich fruit—blackberry jam, plums in syrup, black cherries—and luscious dark chocolate, with well-integrated oak, leather, maple syrup drizzle, and overtones of herbs. It’s consistent into the finish, with cooked fruit, leather, mint and other herbal flavors, and plenty of chocolate. (2,500 bottles)"
1817,"<price>36<rating>83<whiskey>High West Silver OMG Pure Rye, 49.3%<review>It seemed a good idea to revisit OMG after High West had four years’ experience under their belt. The wet grain and green apple are still there, with the bitter fringe of rye crisping things nicely. Pure rye High West spirit, no oak, and you see where this may go. A smooth, almost creamy entry—smooth for the proof—and the rye takes over, though grainy sweetness refuses to quit. More polished now. Hope there’s plenty in wood."
1818,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Dusko Fine Whiskey, 40%<review>A dull stewed-fruit note with polished apples, pink blancmange, rose hip, and a dash of spice, but not a very demonstrative whisky. The body is light and flimsy, even for a 3 year old blend, and the palate offers the return of that sweet pink blancmange, light caramel, and the sweetness of candy cigarettes. It crosses the line with late sugary sweetness and a short peppery finish. Life’s all about choices."
1819,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenanace (distilled at Longmorn) 11 year old, 46%<review>Pale straw. Light but intense, with some pollen, dusty fruits, baked apple. Water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime. Performs much better in the mouth, and although hot, shows good distillery character with some cooked peach, quince jam, and yellow plums. A decent lunchtime dram. £50"
1820,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Spirit Hound Single Barrel Straight Malt (Barrel 66), 45%<review>Floral with some hoppy aromas to start, as well as lemon curd, vanilla, banana Runts, ripe pears, and amaretto. On the palate, gentle oakiness underpins banana pudding, whipped cream, spiced plum, amaretto, ginger candy, peaches, and chai spices of cardamom, clove, and cinnamon. Well-structured and delicate—add water sparingly."
1821,"<price>800<rating>93<whiskey>Michter’s 25 year old Bourbon, 58.1%<review>It packs a beautiful nose, with arcs of chocolate, vanilla wafer, cherry, caramelized brown sugar, baked pears, crème brûlée being torched, and coconut. These notes become concentrated and are complemented by cola, tobacco, spice, toffee, and pepper. Then hazelnut and vanilla coat the mouth, sitting there for a couple of minutes until the end—a supremely long finish. What complexity!"
1822,"<price>159<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts At Anchor in a Cove 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia), 46%<review>The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes this 22 year old expression of Glen Scotia, matured in a bourbon barrel that provided 304 bottles. The nose offers soft spices, orchard fruits, and a faint hint of ozone. Richly fruity on the palate, with mandarin oranges, vanilla, and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish is gingery and warming, with light smoke, aniseed, and plain chocolate at the close. £100"
1823,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marchesi di Barolo Wine Cask-Finished, 46%<review>Baked plum desserts, sweet cherry, star anise, and dark vanilla on the nose, with an enticing freshly toasted spiciness. Caramel, plum, pomegranate, and rawhide shoelaces shift into a concentrated fruitiness as allspice and pepper well up, yielding a sweet core of graham crackers, marshmallows, and creamy vanilla, with hints of chocolate. Bruised fruit and throbbing spices characterize the finish on this laudable example of wine finishing. (1,020 bottles)"
1824,"<price>130<rating>93<whiskey>Chivas Regal 18 year old Ultimate Cask Collection First Fill Japanese Oak Finish, 48%<review>A blast of exotic spices, followed by sweet oak, juicy tangerines, bosc pear, sandalwood, petitgrain oil, and vanilla seeds; it’s that junction of oak and spices where the mizunara has worked its magic. The palate is medium in weight with caramel, hazelnut, and a collision of orange and active spices, with the mizunara continuing to influence the flavor of the finish. The cooperage may be arduous but it’s worth it. (Global Travel Retail)"
1825,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Peat Elements of Islay, 59.3%<review>Roasted spices, more peat than smoke, coastal breezes, lemon creaminess, bacon-flavored chips, and carbolic soap. Disarmingly, it starts with lemon, apple, and honey before, brilliantly, the pepper and chili heat slams into you like an Acme grand piano falling from the sky. Bitter chocolate notes, velvety cocoa, and dry orange peel, with morning-after cigar smoke, settling ash, and roasted meat juices. Seriously impressive delivery of flavor from Oliver Chilton, who has concocted a versatile dram at a terrific value. £35"
1826,"<price>17<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Five Star, 40%<review>It begins innocently enough. Ripening strawberries, cotton candy, and fudge on the nose, but with an undertow of devil-may-care spiciness. Soft mandarin citrus, vanilla fudge, sponge cupcakes, and a decent wedge of malt form the core of the palate; the spice is disappointingly mild considering the potential of the first sniff. Sweet and syrupy finish. Still, solid enough to make your world better at the end of a hard day."
1827,"<price>95<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan Edition No. 3, 48.3%<review>The third release in Macallan’s annual Edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of European and American oak casks. Figs and apricot jam, vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit, Bit-O-Honey, then creamy milk chocolate. Milk chocolate persists through the long, fruity finish, with attendant sweet oak."
1828,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>Glendalough 13 year old Mizunara Cask, 46%<review>Precious few distillers outside of Japan are resourceful and determined enough to lay their hands on virgin mizunara oak to cooper their own finishing puncheons, let alone allow you to experience its flavors at such a reasonable price. Stone fruit, Quaker oats, comb honey, and sandalwood aromas are followed by ripe melon and tropical fruit flavors trailed by cocoa. Fragrant spices contribute to a sublime balance, with spicy chocolate, coffee grounds, and menthol to finish. This is a rare gem among Irish whiskeys. Number 18 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
1829,"<price>44<rating>83<whiskey>Lord Elcho 15 year old, 40%<review>The eldest son of the 5th earl of Wemyss, Lord Elcho was supportive to the Young Pretender. Proportionally, more sherry at play here. Plum skin, chunky raisins, blackcurrant, and fainter sweetened cocoa and coffee bean notes. The palate is a little hollow at first, then proffers barley sugar, rich shortbread, baked apple, linseed, and toffee, though the flavor development plateaus. Water picks out sweet clementine notes. Given the choice of expressions, I prefer the vibrancy of the Young(er) Pretender. £26"
1830,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Garioch 1797 Founder’s Reserve, 48%<review>Butterscotch, vanilla, pepper, and citrus fruit emerge on the nose. A nutty, peppery palate features orchard fruits, chile spice, and a subtle meatiness. Lemon and oak tannins in the medium-length finish."
1831,"<price>85<rating>93<whiskey>Remus Repeal Reserve Straight Bourbon (Series IV), 50%<review>The nose is fruity and deep, with cherry cough drop, grape candy, strawberry jam, buttered pecans, iced tea, dusty baking spice, and a hint of tobacco barn; water brings out fresher fruit, plus toasted grain and brown sugar. Mouth-filling and chewy, the palate has dimension and more berries and cherries, sweet with syrup; water focuses the profile on nuts and chocolate. The finish has peppery oak, chocolate-covered coffee bean, and nuts, with quickly fading dark fruit."
1832,"<price>7500<rating>92<whiskey>The Dalmore 40 year old, 42%<review>This was initially matured in American oak bourbon barrels, then spent 7 years in 30 year old Matusalem sherry butts before 2 years of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose yields orange marmalade, wood resin, toasted brioche, and cocktail cherries. Apricot fruitiness on the early palate, then vanilla, ginger, and treacle. The finish is medium in length, with orange peel, fennel, and gentle spices. (750 bottles)"
1833,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street New York Blend, 45%<review>The original Great King Street blend was all sweet lemon and spice. This is something else again. This is a gutsy, urban wise guy of a whisky, rich in peat, with distinctive malty flavors—all in all, closer to a malt than a blend. That's because of the high malt content, and only the rounded edges and soft finish are gilded by grain. Some fruit and spice emerge through the peat, but the smoke's what you remember—a master class in blending."
1834,"<price>75<rating>80<whiskey>Laphroaig Cairdeas Madeira Cask, 51.6%<review>The annual Cairdeas release aims to show Laphroaig in a new light. Initially I thought this too sweet and cask dominated, with the distillery battling against the wine—fresh red fruit and seaweed is a test, even for the best chef. Add water and give it time though, and there is this lightly exotic, herbal, hazelnut-like element. It lacks depth and the tarry thump beloved by many Laphroaig lovers, but is an interesting departure."
1835,"<price>38<rating>96<whiskey>Sazerac Rye, 18 year old, 1983, 45%<review>Deep amber color. Bold and surprisingly youthful aromas, and quite vibrant for its age-huge spicy notes (mint, cinnamon, vanilla, anise, freshly ground pepper), with rich toffee, caramel and background fruit. Rich, enveloping body. Enormous in flavor, with youthful dynamic spices (mint, cinnamon, vanilla, pepper), wrapped in rich toffee and molasses, tamed by mature oak and leather notes. The flavors intensify on the palate, ultimately reaching a crescendo. The boldness of the spices and maturity of age dovetail perfectly. Its finish is very satisfying and seemingly eternal. 
"
1836,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>Usually the sleeper of the Collection. Toffee mixed with cinnamon, mocha, añejo rum, golden raisin, dried citrus, and tobacco, with firm leather and oak on the finish. Last year’s release was more balanced and a great expression of the brand, but I’m afraid this release is a little heavy on the oak; particularly on the finish. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
1837,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Troy and Sons Small Batch Moonshine, 40%<review>Distilled from an almost extinct strain of heirloom corn (Crooked Creek), this is a fully aromatic white whiskey: fresh white corn, crisp apple, and pear float high over the liquid. A soft mouth—not overly hot—brings the fruit, but the corn is a solid underpinning. There’s a dry, almost mineral component to the finish. No flaws, interesting flavors, and nicely integrated for an unaged spirit. "
1838,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Meyer’s Blend Supérieur, 40%<review>Fresh, sharp citrus with lighter elements: floral notes, orange macaroons, and wisps of cotton candy. Lemon peel, tinned mandarin, and tangy grapefruit on the palate, with deeper notes of lemon curd, gooseberry, confectioners’ sugar, and a minor spice note. This delivers a narrow spectrum of flavor for a blend."
1839,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Twelve Five Rye, 47.5%<review>Nose of sweet dried grass and cinnamon, echoed on the palate with supports of sweet, oaky vanilla. The finish develops some doughiness, then finally an oaky spice heat that lingers pleasantly, the most interesting part of the dram. Well-made (at Cedar Ridge, in Iowa) and clean, if not exceptionally complex. A good flask whiskey for a hike. Sourced whiskey."
1840,"<price>78<rating>87<whiskey>Glenrothes, 1994 Vintage, $43%<review>Very bright and lively, with a nice balance of flavors. Zesty fruit (lemon, peach, ripe pineapple, golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla, light honey, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a hint of coconut). Gently dry, delicately spicy, dried citrus finish. Light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner, but it should stand up well enough after dinner, too. This is a nice whisky, but it shows a lighter, more elegant side of Glenrothes. It doesn’t express the rich, opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 Vintage, for example."
1841,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey (Batch 1), 47%<review>A special batch of Stranahan’s, aged in Hungarian oak. The distillery is doing a lot of experimenting with aging their whiskey in different wine barrels. I really like how this one turned out. Nicely sweet, with honey-drenched fruit, golden raisin, cotton candy, caramel apple, Jordon almonds, and grape skins. Good grip -- and a little funky -- on the finish (nothing too assertive, though) which cuts through the sweetness. Not a polished whiskey, but certainly an adventure! (Available only at the distillery.)"
1842,"<price>164<rating>90<whiskey>Stauning Peated Whisky 2nd Edition, 55%<review>A star is born. Stauning is a fledgling Danish distillery whose whiskies are 4 years old. Much as I support new world whiskies, many of them are works in progress. This is, though, the most exciting release since Glann ar Mor of France hit the scene. It's very peaty, rich, fruity, and full, and it's nearly flawless, with few indicators of its youth. This is hard to find, but make a note to snap up the third edition. 895 Krone/500 ml"
1843,"<price>307<rating>90<whiskey>Springbank 21 year old 2014 release, 46%<review>The latest limited release of 21 year old Springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose, which follows up with succulent tropical fruits, toffee, and a whiff of earthy peat. The palate is complex, confident, and oily, with dry sherry notes, almonds, figs, vanilla, wood smoke, and a hint of the sea. The lengthy finish boasts caramel, cinnamon, brine, and soft peat. £182"
1844,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Mortlach 16 year old Distiller’s Dram, 43.4%<review>One of three Mortlachs introduced in 2018, this has much to live up to, as the classic Flora & Fauna Mortlach was also 16 years old. The whisky has been aged entirely in sherry casks. The nose offers malt, gingersnaps, baked apple, and a delicate savory note. Quite full-bodied, with toffee apples, gammon, and old leather on the palate. Cocoa powder and tinned peaches in the finish. Editors’ Choice"
1845,"<price>106<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park 'Hjarta' 12 year old, 58.1%<review>Rich, deep, and muscular on the nose and palate -- and very polished. Notes of caramel/butterscotch-coated citrus (lemon, Clementine) honeyed tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), peaches and cream, creamy vanilla, and ripe barley, along with more subtle smoke, cut grass, and ginger. Firm, dry, resinous grip on the finish keeps all the sweetness in check. Rather expensive for its age, but not for its quality. Very impressive for a 12 year old! (Available only at the Highland Park distillery, their on-line shop, and in Scandinavia.) £65"
1846,"<price>164<rating>87<whiskey>Celtic Cask Deich 10, 46%<review>Following bourbon cask maturation, this spent a further 4 years in red wine casks from Domaine Des Anges. It has a gentle, coastal brininess of smoked eel with apple relish, seashells, lemongrass, with beet root and black fruits. This is a real chewer; toffee bars, raisin, juiced apples, and raspberry. The smokiness builds powerfully and unrelentingly. After a final catch of smoke, the finish has lush mint toffees. A mighty, peaty Irish whiskey from you know where. (351 bottles) €150"
1847,"<price>313<rating>89<whiskey>Glenturret The Brock Malloy Edition, 46.8%<review>Cask # 328 was filled at Glenturret on December 16, 1986 by stillmen Hugh Malloy and Chic Brock. After 28 years of maturation, it has yielded 240 bottles. It is exclusively available online at thefamousgrouse.com. Boiled fruit sweets, heather, hazelnuts, old oak, and musty bung-cloths on the nose, plus slight mint. The palate is rich and fruity, with honey, rum, vanilla fudge, and ginger root. Spicy milk chocolate and coconut in the lengthy finish, with non-intrusive oak. Classic Glenturret. £200"
1848,"<price>195<rating>92<whiskey>Edradour Port Wood Finish, 1983 Vintage, Cask #04/0544, 52.9%<review>One of the first wood finishing efforts under Edradour’s new management. Very creamy in texture, with notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, fruit cake, raisin, and burnt almonds. All this sits on a bed of dry, minty, resinous oak. The flavors dovetail nicely, with a soothing, satisfying finish. The port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating. 
"
1849,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Connemara Turf Mor, 58%<review>Connemara is the peated Irish whiskey from the Cooley distillery, and this one is their (and Ireland’s) smokiest offering yet. This is the first time I ever detected dung (albeit subtly) in a whiskey — and only on the nose, thankfully. It’s curiously intriguing. The style of peat used, along with the youth of this whiskey, has a distinct impact of the whiskey’s flavor. It’s sweet and smoky, which works well. Throw in some bacon fat, diesel oil smoke (like at a boat dock), anise, ginger, honeyed malt, barley, lime, and pear. Underneath all that peat lies what seems like a fairly young whiskey, because it is very brisk and vibrant, but not excessively so. Bonus points for distinctiveness."
1850,"<price>900<rating>83<whiskey>Glenglassaugh, 44 year old, 1960 vintage, 41.7%<review>Very frail. Don’t add any water to this whisky, as its flavors seem to crumble. It’s a subtle whisky too -- one has to tease the flavors out of it. But when you do, with some focus, you’ll find fragrant notes of dried spice, malty vanilla, citrus peal, and elegant floral notes. Surprisingly, the whisky is not overly dry and woody on the palate. The initial impression of this whisky is that it’s too tired and past its prime. With continued exploration and patience, its subtle pleasures emerge."
1851,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Pendleton 20 year old Directors’ Reserve (2017 Release), 40%<review>Joining the core Pendleton lineup, with a new edition expected each September. Past releases of Director’s Reserve have been irregular, perhaps because a local rancher killed the buzz when he bought the entire first batch nearly a decade ago. A luxuriously creamy body coats your palate with mild vanilla, butterscotch, restrained white pepper, and nutty plum pudding. Pencil shavings punctuate a medium finish. Less complexity than its age predicts."
1852,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Four Roses Single Barrel (Barrel #87-6L), 50%<review>A fuller-bodied, sweeter encounter than Barrel #55-6F reviewed below. More rounded and even-keeled throughout, too! Chewy toffee, rummy molasses, and nougat, with underlying notes of dark, berried fruit, accentuating spice, and supple leather. The heavyweight of the group.

1853,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Balvenie 12 year old The Sweet Toast of American Oak, 43%<review>Matured primarily in bourbon barrels for 12 years before a 3-month finish in slow-toasted virgin American oak barrels from Kelvin Cooperage in Kentucky. Honey, vanilla, cloves, dried fruit, and lively oak on the nose. The palate features citrus fruit and more cloves, with milk chocolate, honey, walnuts, and lots of wood spice. Raisins and black tea in the medium-length finish. (30,000 bottles)"
1854,"<price>180<rating>89<whiskey>Wemyss Malts The Rockpool 1995 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 57.2%<review>A very solid and sound Bowmore with saline notes, some dried hot pepper, and masses of menthol, which give a buzzy, nose-cleaning effect. The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended."
1855,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Maple Wood Finish, 47.2%<review>Finished in toasted maple wood. I love the nose on this: complex notes of rum, golden raisin, maple syrup, nougat, polished leather, and warming cinnamon. The love continues on the palate, but toward the finish the flavors turn a bit aggressive (leather, tannins), which somewhat tarnishes an otherwise exciting, well-orchestrated whiskey."
1856,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>The Tyrconnell Original, 43%<review>Repackaged at a higher strength, the nose is grassy, with lemon zest, hints of apple and pear, vanilla seeds, almonds, and fresh florals. Light honey and summer fruits, barley notes, and vanilla, becoming juicier over time with base notes of whole spice, before serving up a lemon-and-honey lozenge finish. Very assured, this double-distilled single malt is a must for your Irish whiskey shelf. Best Value"
1857,"<price>108<rating>87<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 1992 21 year old HH9452, 55.7%<review>There’s little quality Port Dundas being bottled, so don’t pass up the opportunity for this one. It evokes aromas of grated milk chocolate, grilled pancakes, apricot, mango, and poached pear Jell-O, with spice notes of ground cumin, cinnamon, and nutmeg. This is simply delicious: a honey pot of sticky sweetness. A rich, cask strength grain whisky with notes of mandarin and candied jellies. A dash of water enables the sweet, creamy flavors to swirl around the mouth. £64"
1858,"<price>105<rating>81<whiskey>St. George Royal Marriage, 46%<review>Released to celebrate the wedding of Prince William and Kate, it’s a combination of casks, with the standard unpeated and peated English whiskies mixed with malt matured in a mix of casks. The nose is nothing special, but the whisky is something else again. It’s initially bold, spicy, and assertive, but swim over the first waves and there’s a calmer, fruitier heart here. Another big step forward for an increasingly confident distillery. "
1859,"<price>88<rating>90<whiskey>The Lakes The Whiskymaker’s Edition Colheita, 52%<review>

Dhavall Ghandhi’s latest one-off creation uses casks that held colheita (single vintage aged tawny port). Fragrant and appealing, with spices, apple jelly, pink Turkish delight, plums, warm coffee grounds, Seville orange peel, forest honey, and cedar boxes. Flavors of cherry, toffee, pepper, clove, and an early surge of high alcohol, it develops a creamy mouthfeel with cranberry, sultana, and sweet cinnamon buns, finishing with leather, tobacco, and prune juice. £65"
1860,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Glenrothes 10 year old, 40%<review>Quite youthful on the nose, with barley, vanilla, and finally nectarines. Smooth and medium-bodied, with floral notes, custard, and milk chocolate. A relatively short finish, with sappy oak."
1861,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Chivas Regal 18 year old, 40%<review>It rarely gets better than this. Vanilla, almond slice, toffee, pencil shavings, sweet oak, and mild wood spices on the nose. Effortlessly smooth and delicate, this warms up gradually, with malt, dark fudge, leather, raisin, and tobacco notes before the wood spices, oak, and chocolate take center stage, ending with a warm, lengthy finish. This must be master blender Colin Scott’s most preciously guarded recipe. The man’s a genius!"
1862,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Old Hickory Blended Bourbon, 40%<review>A blend of two MGP bourbons, 11% 2 year old, 89% 4 year old. Simple sweet corn nose, with some cinnamon and hard candies; hot for 40%. Underwhelming for a whiskey named for President Jackson; warm and sweet, though with some oak-based bitterness at the fringes. Stays sweet through the finish. Not flawed, but not well thought-out either. Might be the blandest MGP juice I’ve ever had. Sourced whiskey."
1863,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Chicken Cock Beer Barrel Select, 45%<review>Dried orange and apricot, cherry hard candy, and vanilla frosting on the nose, along with cantaloupe, peanut butter, and grainy notes of seed corn. The palate is light, spiced, and oak-driven, with more corn, peanuts, chocolate sauce, and orange oil, plus vanilla, iced tea, citrus oil, lemon, spice, and chili pepper. The finish offers more heft, but is light, though with some interesting elements on offer."
1864,"<price>71<rating>90<whiskey>Santis Appenzeller Cask Strength Peated, 52%<review>Two years ago I included this at a London whisky and music festival for 1,000 cool and trendy young music fans. This was the star of the show. When it says “peated,” it means sooty, charcoal-like church incense, with smoked meats and salami. It's intense, unforgettable, and not unlike a big smoky Swiss cheese. Up there with Balcones and Corsair, IMHO (that’s “In My Humble Opinion.” I'm down with the kids, you see). €55"
1865,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Koval Single Barrel Four Grain (Barrel 897), 47%<review>Oat, malt, rye, and wheat are the four organic grains (like you, I was instantly curious); nice amber color. Hot and sweet (with a hint of dill) on the nose, rafting in on a thick oak plank. Sweet grain, cut wood, and lingering heat make this good, but I'm looking for more complexity. There's no clear handle to this one, no “I'm bourbon,” or “I'm malt,” which is intriguing, but it's just...good, not inspiring. Odd complaint, but there you are."
1866,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Barrell New Year 2018 Limited Edition, 55.6%<review>Quince, coconut, raspberry, and chocolate walk into an array of breads—sourdough, cornbread, Lebanese pita, and pumpernickel rye. Soon a sweetness develops over earthiness. Think hazelnut latte paired with rich lentil soup, followed by jalapeño cornbread and honey. Its strength never shows, but that promise in the taste is not followed in the finish, which is shorter than expected. If the finish held up, it would be a much stronger whiskey."
1867,"<price>131<rating>91<whiskey>Glenfarclas 175th Anniversary, 43%<review>First things first — congratulations to the Grants of Glenfarclas on attaining their 175th anniversary. To celebrate, they have vatted together a cask from 1952 with one each from the following five decades — and released it at an exceptionally reasonable price! The nose has a lift of struck match immediately followed by cedar, pomegranate, blackberry jam, and Seville orange. There’s a thick caramel toffee sweetness to the palate alongside the classic ’Farclas depth where dried, but sweet, fruits repose. Recommended. £80 (Dave Broom) (Value Pick)"
1868,"<price>43<rating>88<whiskey>Johnnie Walker The Spice Road, 40%<review>Somebody at Diageo has been taking a lot of interest in the Johnnie Walker range of late, what with the revamp of the core range and now a regular stream of special releases. This is the first of a series for Travel Retail only, but it takes the Johnnie Walker themes — vanilla, spice, and honey, with wispy peat and smoke — and adds savory spice to the earthiness. But there are some very young notes in this. "
1869,"<price>175<rating>91<whiskey>Four Gate Split Stave by Kelvin Cask-Finished Bourbon, 57.8%<review>A straight bourbon that was finished in barrels made with alternating charred and toasted staves. There’s plenty of wood char and pencil shavings on the nose, along with dry leaves, pine needles, tea leaves, orange peel, clove, nutmeg, cedar, sandalwood, menthol, and licorice. It’s chewy and, naturally, quite oak-forward in the mouth, with complex flavors of spice, dark cherry, black tea, and herbs—mint, licorice, sassafras, and cinnamon. More spice, semi-sweet chocolate, tea leaves, and well-integrated oak into the finish. (2,700 bottles)"
1870,"<price>35<rating>79<whiskey>Stouted, 45%<review>Small barrel-type aromas: sharp, fresh oak and hot grain, but also cocoa hulls and coffee grounds. Tastes youthfully hot, and chocolatey, and sweet, and the oak is raw and forward. More chocolate than stout, I think. (375 ml.)"
1871,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>Eades Islay 'Double Malt', 46%<review>Consists of 60% Bowmore and 40% Caol Ila. Bold, youthful, and somewhat medicinal (as would be expected), with peat smoke, tar, pebbles on a beach, and boat docks. Additional flavors of smoked olives and exotic pepper add intrigue, while honeyed malt notes soothe the palate and provide balance.
"
1872,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label Speyside Origin, 42%<review>Using Cardhu and Glendullan, among other Speyside single malts, to focus on Black Label’s orchard fruit attributes, this has a nose of apple pie, vanilla sponge cake, caramel, and aromatic pan-roasted spices. Sweet and spicy with a glossy mouthfeel, it yields flavors of Fruit Pastilles, vanilla cream, sharp apple, currants, and baked sugar with a gentle undercurrent of spice. Ginger and pepper with jellied fruits and hints of citrus to finish."
1873,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Brenne 10 year old (2017 Release), 48%<review>Rich, supple cognac aromas fit for twilight sipping on a blustery afternoon: cooked apple, prune juice, cinnamon, pecan pie, walnut, and white pepper. A luscious palate of marron glacé, nutmeg, dusty cocoa, prune, toffee apple, nutty dark chocolate brownies, black truffle, and clove. A more rounded, darker, and better-balanced whisky than the restrained 2016 release with its taut, citrus grip. Brenne has found its sweet spot."
1874,"<price>64<rating>89<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Kiln Embers, 46%<review>This is so much more than a pumped-up version of Peat Chimney; this has sweet smoke from singed green wood twigs, light honey, peach, all balanced with TCP-soaked bandages. Nothing harsh or off-putting, it’s just a delight. Sweet honey, orange, generous malt, and caramel, but it’s the smoke coiling its way throughout that makes the greatest impression on the palate and finish. These blended malts tend to move quickly, so grab one while you can. Perfect for winter drinking. (12,000 bottles) £42"
1875,"<price>576<rating>80<whiskey>The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 2005 9 year old (Cask #6587), 57.5%<review>Drawn from a refill barrel, this is Balvenie all eager and bright at the start of its journey. It’s like an excited kid eating pancakes and runny honey (with a squeeze of lemon juice) at breakfast on her first day of school. There’s a hint of malt, a little peachiness, and a hint of the richness that will develop resonance in time. It’s lovely—I’d be happy to drink a couple—but way overpriced. The score has to reflect that. £400"
1876,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Chattanooga 1816 Cask, 56.8%<review>More nose than on the Reserve (see below); no surprise. Sweet spicy candy, alcohol heat, and oak. The spicy candy—clove, cinnamon, allspice—blooms in the mouth, firing up oak and corn, with a meaty fullness and a warming finish. Quite a bit more complex and interesting than the Reserve. Sourced whiskey."
1877,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Aberfeldy 16 year old, 40%<review>Aberfeldy distillery has added a 16 year old expression to its core range, positioned between the existing 12 and 21 year old variants. This newcomer has been finished in oloroso sherry casks, and the result is a pleasing if undemanding dram with a fresh, sweet, sherried nose, featuring orange, honey, and ginger. Smooth on the palate, with more oranges, marzipan, then milk chocolate and gentle spices. Nutty spice, increasingly bitter orange, and dark chocolate in the finish. £62"
1878,"<price>149<rating>93<whiskey>Glenlivet Enigma, 60.6%<review>Part of Glenlivet’s mystery series, the concept is to have drinkers form their impressions with no information about the whisky’s age or cask maturation, although those details will be revealed at year’s end. The nose has notes of lemon curd, melon, fresh peaches, bitter orange, and baked apples. A nimble, creamy palate offers marshmallow, toasted almond, marzipan, and lemon iced tea. The finish has length and vibrance, with crème brûlée, cinnamon, and a tropical note. A delicate, enchanting whisky."
1879,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength (Batch C), 59.1%<review>Cherry, raisin, aniseed, ground pepper, and fruitcake on the nose. The taste experience builds to a spicy clove and pepper fistfight, and while there are glimpses of red apple, it takes time for the spiciness to subside and the other flavors don’t ever really get a chance. Even the chocolate notes on the finish are harried by the spices. Dilution delivers much more enjoyable flavors. (252 bottles)"
1880,"<price>530<rating>91<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1970 (Cask #140), 57.1%<review>Another first fill sherry butt, giving its typical reddish-brown hue. This runs more into the clove, cassia, and allspice area than just dried fruit. While maturity is obvious, and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness, it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. The distillery has fought back against the cask, and while still crepuscular in nature, there is a rich, concentrated, and mellow glow at its heart. £345"
1881,"<price>57<rating>84<whiskey>Liberty Pole Peated Bourbon, 46%<review>Heat and peat dominate the nose—this is young and fiery, with rubber, bonfire, cedar chest, charred corn, and apple aromas. The palate continues to burn, though with a nice amount of grilled meat, red fruit, and flavored tobacco notes, especially when water is added. Unfortunately, the smoke is not so well-integrated and it shows on the finish, which has a cloying sweet ashiness."
1882,"<price>40<rating>73<whiskey>Koval American Oat, 40%<review>Very similar to the Midwest Wheat in aroma, with a slight additional tanginess…but that could be from sensory deprivation. Drier in the mouth, with a slight medicinal character to it that increases as the finish goes on; like a high school chemistry lab storeroom, or a bottle of fresh aspirin. "
1883,"<price>345<rating>87<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 25 year old, 46.8%<review>Distilled in March 1992, this single cask expression was matured in a refill hogshead (#1266). The nose yields heather in bloom, a hint of machine oil, vanilla, orange fondant creams, and a wisp of sweet wood smoke. Smooth on the palate, with creamy orange notes, gentle spice, and, ultimately, soft peat smoke. The finish is relatively long, with Jaffa orange, black pepper, and drying oak. (209 bottles)"
1884,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>High West Yippee Ki-Yay (Batch #19C27), 46%<review>This blend of straight ryes finished in vermouth and syrah barrels now includes some of High West’s own whiskey, distilled in Utah. The nose is fresh and herbal, with spearmint, tarragon, dill pickle, fresh celery juice, and a candied note of orange Kool-Aid. Fruit, nut, and spice flavors temper some of the wild herbaceousness of the palate: blueberry jam, peanuts, cinnamon, and dark chocolate. Lengthy finish, with more dark fruit, nuts, spice, and oak."
1885,"<price>77<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Nectar d’Or 12 year old, 46%<review>Nectar D’Or is aged in bourbon barrels for 10 years, before 2 years of finishing in sauternes wine casks. The nose offers apricots in syrup, honey, walnuts, and ripe green grapes, while the oily palate yields citrus fruits and honeyed cereal notes, along with white pepper and wood spice. The finish is long and oaky, with a fleeting return of apricots."
1886,"<price>550<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Twenty Something, 46.3%<review>This 23 year old expression was released for the Ardbeg Committee. It includes whisky matured in sherry and bourbon casks. Sweet asphalt, bonfire smoke, lemon sponge drizzled in iodine, and background cinnamon on the nose. Succulent, sherried, and chocolate-coated orchard fruits on the oily palate, with vanilla and sweet peat. The peat dries slowly in the finish, with developing licorice, kippers, and peppery oak"
1887,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Exclusive Regions Single Grain (distilled at North British) 10 year old, 50%<review>The nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it, like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. In addition to acetone, there is orange fondant and the smell of new Legos. Soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy, soft peaches, and pineapple, but it’s all swept aside by a Tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. Finish of Gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)"
1888,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Adnams Rye Malt, 47%<review>Rye has been farmed for centuries in England, and this sustainably-minded brewer and distiller uses grain grown by company chairman Jonathan Adnams on his farm close to the facility in Southwold. Rye takes the lead in this 75% rye and 25% malted barley whisky, matured in new medium-toast French oak casks for a minimum of 5 years. Creamy and spicy on the nose, it’s slightly nutty, with hints of mixed peel, graham crackers, hazelnut, and nutmeg. A thick, malty mouthfeel of toffee and cinnamon finds harmony between the sweetness, crisp rye, and fresh green edge of the spices. Number 20 in the 2019 Top 20 "
1889,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 11.1, 59.4%<review>
Made with barley malted to 139.6 ppm, distilled in 2014, and matured 5 years in first-fill Jim Beam, Jack Daniel, and Heaven Hill casks. Citrus fruit and unripe bananas on the nose, and in time, clean pine notes. Vanilla, salted caramel, chewy orange, and prickly woodsmoke on the palate. Lively, prickly, prominent peat, a suggestion of honey, and more citrus fruit in the lengthy finish. (30,000 bottles)"
1890,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Corsair Wildfire American Malt, 50%<review>Distilled from hickory-smoked malted barley. The nose leads with dark barbecue smoke, mulberry, orange peel, cedar chest, and winter campfire. Earl Grey tea, tobacco leaf, orange oil, and black pepper dominate the palate, along with a great deal of thick, heavy smoke. A lot of new wood character and slightly rough around the edges, but compelling. The sort of whiskey you’d find in a crumbling tower deep in the woods."
1891,"<price>26<rating>95<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2000 Vintage (Barrel No. 1), 43.3%<review>Very elegant, bright, and silky smooth, with honey-kissed summer fruits, subtle tropical fruit (papaya, coconut, pineapple), gentle caramel, sweet corn, and soothing vanilla, along with a dusting of cinnamon, nutmeg, and crisp mint. Pleasing, gently spicy finish. The most impressive aspect of this whiskey isn’t its variety of flavors (they are fairly traditional for a bourbon this age), it’s their integration and remarkable balance! It’s also perilously drinkable. I can’t speak for the other barrels, but if you can track down some bottles of Barrel No. 1, buy two! You won’t be disappointed. Let me also note what a great value this whiskey is, compared to the way other premium American whiskeys are being priced."
1892,"<price>110<rating>93<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 11 year old Bottled in Bond (Spring 2018 Release), 50%<review>Fruit bliss. Filled with apple, pear, dried apricot, and peaches, it then offers floral and rich caramel notes. Chocolate fried pie, pumpkin pie, and vanilla custard follow over a creamy mouthfeel. Then nuts set in, including roasted almonds, salted walnuts, and pecans. Honey and malt appear toward the end for a long and wonderful finish with a light hint of cinnamon. Editor’s Choice"
1893,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>James E. Pepper 1776 Straight 100 Proof, 50%<review>Classic rye notes of orange and pepper spice along with vanilla custard. A full mouthfeel presages a palate of lemon meringue pie, whipped cream, caramel, baking spice, and herbaceous notes of pine and dill, but also tropical flavors, melon, and peach. A lengthy finish that’s full and rich, offering chocolate and reprising the tropical notes of pineapple and orange on the back note. Quite powerful, solid, and reliable."
1894,"<price>84<rating>87<whiskey>Tweeddale Single Lowland Malt 14 year old, 46%<review>This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose, with potato skins, salt, and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity, caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty, with orange sherbet, along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50"
1895,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 10 year old (distilled at Glen Grant), 40%<review>This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose, with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight, offering more fresh fruit notes, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke."
1896,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Glen Scotia 2003 Campbeltown Malts Festival Rum Cask Finished (2019 Release), 51.3%<review>The nose has sweet smoke and more prominent aromas of banana, vanilla, guava, papaya, jasmine, hibiscus, and citrus oil, with some salinity and chalky minerality. The palate is consistent: intense tropical fruit—guava, mango, coconut—plus hazelnut, smoked almonds, milk chocolate, and salty kelp. It finishes with smoked nuts, toasted tobacco, chalky minerality, dry oak, and persistent fruitiness. Lots to unpack here, and it develops beautifully with water—take your time."
1897,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Lagavulin 8 year old, 48%<review>Light in color it may be, but this is no wimp. The nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt, but it’s also sweet, which allows it to be fresh, lively, yet balanced. The palate delivers some menthol, bay laurel, more brininess, a hint of malt, and Parma violet. Everything remains very breezy, with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic."
1898,"<price>16<rating>78<whiskey>Southern Shine Apple Pie Moonshine, 50%<review>Even though it has more alcohol than Southern Shine’s straight ‘moonshine,’ the nose is fairly evasive, with subtle cinnamon apple. The entry is much sweeter than expected, with caramel, cinnamon, and apple, but manages to be well-balanced by the base spirit, which adds pepper spice and enhances the cinnamon. The apple notes flirt with artificiality but end up reading as dried apple. The finish is long and maintains the cinnamon-apple spice well, but is a tad hot."
1899,"<price>1100<rating>93<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Odyssey, 40%<review>Jim Beveridge delivered these aromas of toffee apple, peach, and rich berry fruits by working with European oak casks. The smoke is timid, with hints of background salinity. The finely structured mouthfeel is where this triple malt whisky truly shines: the polished smoothness is exceptional. The flavor journey begins with honey, citrus, and swirling melted chocolate, building to a fire of squeezed orange oils, dry fruits, and pecan nuttiness before concluding with rich espresso, dark caramels, and plain chocolate. Immaculate."
1900,"<price>212<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Rosebank) 21 year old, 50%<review>The Glasgow-based independent bottler Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has been responsible for quite a number of releases from the ‘lost’ Lowland distillery of Rosebank, and this one was distilled during January 1990 and bottled in April 2012. The nose is pleasingly floral and fragrant, light and gently honeyed, with a suggestion of barley in the background. The palate features spicy, sweet orange, herbs, and a slightly contrasting note of citrus fruit. Spices persist into the warming, lightly-oaked finish. £135"
1901,"<price>152<rating>92<whiskey>Lagavulin Feis Ile (2013 Release, Distilled 1995), 51%<review>Though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage
warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized
nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and
layered, with Latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive,
tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is
touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99"
1902,"<price>17<rating>81<whiskey>Ethan Knoll 8 year old, 40%<review>A mild nose with hints of caramel and dry grasses just vaguely suggests the flavors that wait in the glass. The sweetness of navel oranges and slow-developing peppery notes lead into the classic Canadian combination of caramel, cloves, ginger, and white pepper. Earthy vegetal tones, almost like riverweeds, and a strong but pleasant bitterness are glazed with creamy Mackintosh caramel. Dusty grain and pepper fade quickly in a shortish finish."
1903,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 13 year old Glen Elgin 2006 Single Cask (Cask No. 9800011), 54.1%<review>A bit reticent on the nose, with light aromas of jasmine, freesia, coconut, vanilla, and hints of kiwi, pineapple, and strawberry. The palate is oily and highlights more coconut, pineapple, vanilla, and strawberry, plus lemon, sandalwood, and mingled spices. On the finish, crushed nuts top a chocolate and vanilla malted milkshake, and lengthy oak caps things off. (156 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
1904,"<price>148<rating>90<whiskey>Old Pulteney 18 year old, 46%<review>This replaces the 21 year old expression. Initially matured in bourbon and second-fill American oak casks, and then in Spanish oak oloroso butts. Rich, warming aromas of cinnamon, honey, oak, and milk chocolate. The chocolate darkens on the full palate, with contrasting ripe pears and crème brûlée. A hint of brine, along with citrus fruits and light oak in the lengthy finish."
1905,"<price>99<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan Concertmaster, 40%<review>An effusive offering of dark fruits: cranberry, blueberry, and black currant. This is a beautiful marriage of the spirit and the port cask finishing, showing applesauce, aged oak, macaroons, and dry aromatic spices. Black currant holds sway on the tongue, yielding to caramel, ground ginger, a second burst of juicy blueberry, with a hot finish evoking strips of dried tropical fruit and flashes of ground pepper. Rewarding and flavorsome."
1906,"<price>245<rating>85<whiskey>Chichibu On The Way, 58.3%<review>Lifted, quite estery and delicate, with fruit blossom, preserved lemon, and light minerality. It needs water; when added, out burst blossoms, brioche, and fondant icing. On the palate, there’s a frothy pink party going on: marshmallows, flowers, raspberry, and cream. Water adds silkiness, while the finish throws out yuzu, then tightens in the manner typical for a young whisky (it’s 3 years old). Not only on the way, but getting there. ¥25,000/700 ml"
1907,"<price>145<rating>91<whiskey>Mars Komagatake Limited Edition Japanese Single Malt (2019 Release), 48%<review>If whisky were a warm hug, this would be it. The sweet nose is rich with a lovely fruitiness of satsuma, Seville orange marmalade, yuzu, and vanilla. This carries a velvety texture rippled with an orange-flavored effervescence; apricot jam, sweet orange, sherbet, fine spices, ground ginger, and hot pepper. If this well-made example is an indication of the Mars Shinshu house style, they are getting a lot of things right. (10,000 bottles)"
1908,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Chattanooga Straight Rye Malt (Batch 20G05R2), 49.5%<review>If you’re searching for the perfect whiskey to pair with ribs, look no further. Chili powder spices of paprika, cumin, black pepper, and dried chiles leap out of the glass, along with tea leaf, dark berries, dark chocolate, and candied orange peel. The palate, chewy and textured, stays consistent with savory and spicy notes of Spanish chorizo, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, red pepper flakes, blackberry, raspberry, and orange peel. It finishes short but satisfying, with more chili powder, black pepper, and smoked almonds."
1909,"<price>175<rating>88<whiskey>Tomintoul 27 year old, 40%<review>Very similar in flavor profile to the Tomintoul 16, reviewed below, but better. The longer aging has provided extra character and depth. Also, on the palate, the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the whisky’s finish is longer and a shade drier. It has aged gracefully, with no excessive woodiness. A whisky that reveals its charm slowly and subtly.

1910,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Kooper Family Rye Blend of Straight Rye Whiskeys, 45%<review>

Sweet citrus pervades throughout, starting with fresh orange and lime zest on the nose, as well as honey, cotton candy, coconut flakes, brown sugar, and a hint of bubble gum. Orange and lemon slices on the palate, along with a sprinkling of lime zest when water is added; toasted wood, cinnamon, and pops of fresh ginger add some excitement. The finish is short and a touch thin, retaining some gingery spice."
1911,"<price>179<rating>86<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Seven Stars, 45%<review>This is the second release from this tiny independent Swedish distillery and it takes a confident step forward from the first, though it's not the finished article yet. The youthfulness is there but there's much to admire, too: citrus notes, mainly lemon, some melon, tropical fruit (mango, perhaps?), and some soft orange fruits make for a gentle, almost blend-like whisky. Late saltiness and a touch of pepper ensure it's not cloying, and distinctively Swedish. Very encouraging."
1912,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>The Maltman (distilled at Ben Nevis) 17 year old, 49.3%<review>This 17 year old independent bottling of Ben Nevis has somewhat unusually been matured in a fino sherry cask, rather than the more common oloroso or PX.   The nose offers initial milk chocolate notes, then a whiff of cold roast pork and oak. In time, strawberry and mango aromas appear. The mouthfeel is pleasingly full, decidedly gingery, with caramel and dry sherry. Spicy, mild sherry and raisins in a long, lively finish."
1913,"<price>110<rating>92<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Sankt Claus, 53.2%<review>Handpicked from over 100 casks, this is a belter! Puréed prune, dunnage, black licorice, clove, coffee bean, and raisin-studded chocolate. It’s like scorched earth after a wildfire. There is a syrupy, dark rum-like sweetness, a medley of cinnamon, cocoa, raisin, and vanilla essence. Water flushes out some gentle smoke and adds smoothness, but by god, it’s wonderful neat. The best yet from Spirit of Hven. (294 bottles) 975 SEK"
1914,"<price>1735<rating>91<whiskey>Benromach 1977, 56%<review>This 39 year old was matured in a single refill American hogshead. Orange Jujubes on the early nose, with vanilla, honey, and linseed. Big, sweet, soft fruit notes on the palate, with pipe tobacco and a hint of background peat smoke. Aniseed and ginger develop, along with the merest hint of old oak in the persistently fruity finish. £1,250; Not available in the U.S. (225 bottles)"
1915,"<price>77<rating>83<whiskey>Double Barrel Laphroaig/Mortlach, 46%<review>This is one of the more intriguing of the Double Barrel series, because while the others either complement each other or don’t,
this has a depth to it that you need to look for. At first it’s all Laphroaig, and the peat and sea burst out of the glass. But just as you’re asking yourself what the point is, the fruity notes of the Mortlach cushion the whole landing and let you down gently. Impressive. £48"
1916,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>House of Hazelwood 25 year old, 40%<review>Toasty granola, rye crackers, barley sugar sweetness, and Murray Mints make for a balanced nose on this top-of-the-range blend representing the art deco elegance of 1920s Shanghai. A gloriously thick texture of rich citrus blossoms bolstered by toffee, lime, pineapple, tropical fruits, and vanilla sugar. Mr. Kinsman has engineered methodical and well-paced complexity here, with emergent little lights of spiciness. A long-lasting, deep orange buzz and dimming spice round off proceedings. A precious joy indeed. £115 Travel Retail exclusive"
1917,"<price>45<rating>91<whiskey>The Whistler 7 year old The Blue Note, 46%<review>Voluptuous, fruity nose of lemon meringue pie, Conference pear, and fudge, with floral top notes balanced by aromatic spices. The flavors are focused around orange, pear, and lemon, infiltrated by caramel and hectored by some abiding spice notes of ginger, clove, and pepper. Late gains made by honey and nougat at the end. Lemon sherbet and aniseed frame the conclusion. Superb sourced single malt from Boann Distillery."
1918,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>GlenDronach 14 year old Virgin Oak, 46%<review>Initially matured in recharred puncheons, then transferred for an unspecified period into virgin American oak casks. The nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee, vanilla, clementine, and wood varnish. More icing sugar, with orange and fudge on the palate, plus wood spice and an herbal note. Fruity through the finish, while spice builds, with a hint of aniseed at the close. An interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich GlenDronach style."
1919,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Deadwood Straight Bourbon, 40.5%<review>Vivacious and fresh aromas of raspberry, licorice cookies, brown sugar, herbal tea, and toasted oak. The palate falls a little short of the setup, with a light body and some youthful heat driven by oak. Nevertheless, orange and lemon peels, roasted pecans, caramel, blackberry, nutmeg, and black pepper punch through the wood, demonstrating a well-executed, if simple, bourbon."
1920,"<price>230<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Rogues’ Banquet, 46%<review>With its nose of honey, green apple, lemon, and fragrant spices, this kicks off Compass Box’s 20th anniversary celebration. Blended by lead whisky maker James Saxon, it has an unctuous, luxurious texture, malty and sweet, with dark toffee, gingersnaps, cinnamon, lemon zest, dried tropical fruits, and vanilla cream. The gentle spices ebb and flow, finishing on a last hurrah of dark cookies and vanilla. (2,400 bottles for U.S.) Collectible"
1921,"<price>261<rating>92<whiskey>Redbreast All Sherry Single Cask, 59.9%<review>First you think you love Redbreast, and then they go and release a triple-distilled single pot still sherry single cask from 1999. Coffee beans, chocolate buttons, nougat, wet leather jackets, macaroon, and black bananas. A sweet sherry baptism of fresh fig fruit and dark toffee, with blackened char wriggling delightfully under the tongue. Thick and oily, a savory tone surfaces, closed by coffee and heavy clove. Chicory coffee and licorice finish. Epic: extroverted northern cardinal to the chirpy European robin. (576 bottles, The Whisky Exchange only) £180"
1922,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 'Connoisseurs Choice' (distilled at Bladnoch), 13 year old, 1991 Vintage, 46%<review>Subtle elegance, creamy, and extremely drinkable. Mouthwatering fruity notes (lemon, lime, tangerine, passion fruit) marry well with notes of fresh-cut grass, vanilla, and honey. Very clean too and nicely balanced! When I drink a Lowland whisky this good, I am saddened by all of the Lowland distilleries that have gone silent over the past 25 years, knowing what we have lost. 
"
1923,"<price>90<rating>79<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Sonoma-Cutrer Finish, 43.2%<review>This is pot still Woodford Reserve bourbon finished in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay wine barrels. (It’s the second iteration in the Master’s Collection, following the Four Grain release.) The wine influence is immediately obvious-it is sweet and fruity on the nose and palate. Notes of caramel apples, toffee pudding, butterscotch, toasted pecan, and peach crisp. Polished oak finish. I’d like a little less sweetness-or a little more of something to balance it, like more dried oak spice. 
"
1924,"<price>43<rating>84<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Classic Selection Benachie, 43%<review>Benachie, formerly known as Jericho, was an Aberdeenshire distillery built southeast of Huntly that existed from 1822–1913. A dark amber dram with a nose of marmalade, ground almond, cherry lips, and vanilla essence. Attractive, but not overly aromatic. Cooked plums after a peppery rush begin an attenuated flavor journey, exiting with a spicy finale."
1925,"<price>68<rating>88<whiskey>Mars Iwai Tradition Yamanashi Wine Cask-Finished, 40%<review>This carmine dram has a soft, mellow nose of raisin, earthy red wine notes, wet slate, prune flesh, stewed rhubarb, caramelized brown sugar, and maple syrup. It’s fruity rather than sweet on the palate, but it seems held back at 40% ABV without a heavier mouthfeel, showing date, red plum, sultana, fudge, red velvet cake, brown sugar, and peppery spice, with a raspberry and spice finish."
1926,"<price>49<rating>87<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon, 40%<review>This light-hued bourbon is bright and airy, with tropical fruit aromas of papaya and lychee, vanilla, and sweet lemon curd. While not especially bourbon-like it’s interesting and super-likeable for its Bit-O-Honey candy and pleasingly nutty notes. Last reviewed in 2011."
1927,"<price>59<rating>82<whiskey>Moon Harbour PIER 1, 45.8%<review>Named for the Port de la Lune, of course, the crescent arc of the Garonne flowing through Bordeaux. The company expects to start single malt production in 2017 in their new distillery, but meanwhile enjoy this Sauternes cask finish with its white grape, light honey, floral, and peach aromas.  Flavor delivery is all up front; peach syrup and soft toffees, with some burnt spices on the finish. A character of its own, certainly not an imitator."
1928,"<price>66<rating>84<whiskey>West Cork Sherry Cask Finish 12 year old, 43%<review>Prune juice and some fresh cream on the nose. The sticky palate delivers flavors of apple juice, tangerine, and gooseberry. The spices get popping, growing peppery, but despite the ripe fruits, it could benefit from more sweetness. The long spicy finish is redolent of aniseed throat lozenges. It would have been fascinating to taste the unfinished whiskey or a version after a longer sherry finish."
1929,"<price>60<rating>72<whiskey>Distillery Select 'Croftengea' (distilled at Loch Lomond), 9 year old, 1997 vintage, 45%<review>Quite pale in color. Very youthful and naked, with damp peat, leafy smoke, charred oak, and black licorice, pears in honey and vanilla-tinged barley. Quite an eye-opener for a non-Islay whisky. It’s a little green and ornery. Certainly an entertaining whisky, but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out, meld the flavors together, and add depth. 
"
1930,"<price>40<rating>93<whiskey>Old Ezra 7 year old Barrel Strength, 58.5%<review>Dripping with butterscotch and marzipan, this is a gorgeous mix of confections and spice. The toasted sweetness of coconut macaroon cookies and graham cracker pie crust meets clove, orange peel, teaberry, and a seductive sandalwood note. A whirlwind of spices grabs hold of the tongue, sinking slowly into creamy nut butters, earthy tannins, and toasted pecan. The persistent sweet caramel and fruit handle generous water without yielding, just revealing ever more flavor. Editors’ Choice"
1931,"<price>174<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Glen Scotia) 'Strawberry Ganache,' 46%<review>This single cask variant of Glen Scotia has been matured in a sherry butt for 21 years, and the cask yielded 833 bottles. Fruity on the nose, with sultanas, cherries, marzipan, and milk chocolate. The palate showcases overripe oranges, sherry, and plain chocolate, with a tang of brine. Drying in the finish, with pepper, licorice, and subtle smoke. £110"
1932,"<price>952<rating>84<whiskey>Port Ellen 32 year old, 52.5%<review>A mix of two types of cask, both refill. Typical Port Ellen on the nose, very clean, precise, and austere, hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. Though there are hints of apple and almond, it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. With water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. The palate starts with Darjeeling tea and roasted fruits, then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. As challenging as ever, and actually a bit too dry. £600"
1933,"<price>95<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg Alligator, 51.2%<review>Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old, except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). An aggressive whisky — even for Ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too, with coal tar, soot, bourbon barrel char, espresso, cocoa, licorice root, smoked fish, and a hint of ginger. There’s a nice creamy vanilla underbelly to balance the aggressiveness and (at least partially) muzzle the Alligator."
1934,"<price>28<rating>86<whiskey>Highwood Ninety 5 year old, 45%<review>In June 2013, flooding washed away most of Highwood’s finished whisky. Although barrels in the warehouse went unscathed, new releases such as this one have been limited. Too bad. Initial nose tickle erupts into sweet caramel and rich black fruits. Hot pepper trickling down your throat leaves a lovely hot burn followed by waves of sweet saltwater taffy. Yes, it’s slightly salty. Weighty and mouth-coating, this whisky feels big and full in the mouth. (Alberta/British Columbia only.) C$28"
1935,"<price>85<rating>95<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master's Collection Four Grain, Batch #2, 46.2%<review>Batch #1, while a very good bourbon, didn’t quite seem to reach its potential. The flavors were there, but were not integrated and as cohesive as I would have hoped for in a four-grain, pot-distilled bourbon. Batch #2 has realized this whiskey’s full potential. The flavors I expect are all there, and they are more tightly integrated and polished. It really does taste different than any other bourbon on the market. I particularly enjoy its silky, creamy, nutty sweetness, which is balanced nicely with dry spice notes that peak on the finish. It’s very soothing and enjoyable. A whisky for bourbon and scotch drinkers alike. 
"
1936,"<price>38<rating>82<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Mosby’s Spirit, 40%<review>The second craft rye I’m revisiting. Mosby’s is still 100% organic rye and unaged, but the nose is more fun: some green pear and melon esters in there with the grassy rye spice. It’s nicely smooth on the tongue, delivers exactly what the nose promised, plus a shot of fresh-cracked black pepper…and a much longer finish these days. Greatly improved; a good white whiskey."
1937,"<price>67<rating>91<whiskey>Spade & Bushel 12 year old Double Barrel, 42.3%<review>Lemon and lime, grapefruit peel, fondant, and pine needles, with the softness of marshmallows and musty spices. Lemon peel, zested lime, pear, honey, and vanilla flavors, with gentle spice supporting the citrus and stubborn black pepper growing in confidence to play a greater role. Mouthfeel is silky and light, becoming creamy. The finish buzzes with spices and hints of baked citrus. €60"
1938,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Gooderham & Worts 49 Wellington Blended, 49%<review>This blend of rye, barley, corn, and wheat whiskies starts big on the nose with caramel-donut glaze that dissolves into buckwheat honey, then sweet orange marmalade. Spices are ever-present, but restrained, while a creamy sweet breadiness prevails throughout. Cereal notes on the palate are awash in honey sweetness. A soft yet tightly integrated whisky with depth and complexity. 100 CAD"
1939,"<price>105<rating>80<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glenallachie) 1992, 47.9%<review>There is something very bedtime drink about this Glenallachie, without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. It’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. The palate is simple, with some fresh apple, pear juice, and a lightly sour edge. The draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. With water, pears come through, making it similar to a tequila blanco. All rather delicate. £63"
1940,"<price>40<rating>75<whiskey>Arran Robert Burns Single Malt, 40%<review>This Robert Burns World Federation Arran Single Island Malt is the Calvados or Poire Williams of the whisky world. There's no age statement on this whisky, but it has the classic aromas and flavors of sweet pears prominent in very young distilled spirits. The vanilla notes, along with its pale color, suggest a used bourbon cask. I suppose one could treat it as an aperitif, and possibly chill it down or serve it on the rocks."
1941,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1992 Vintage, 43% ABV<review>A very fragrant, fruity whisky (orange, tangerine, plum, nectarine) with interwoven notes of honeyed malt, toasted oak, vanilla, and subtle anise. I love the creamy, mouth-coating texture of this whisky and its soothing finish. All the vintages of Glenrothes that have been released over the years are worthy of your hard-earned money, and this one is no exception. There's not as much depth as some of the older, more mature expressions, but the lively youthfulness of this whisky makes up for it."
1942,"<price>137<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular 21 year old (distilled at Glen Scotia), 51.5%<review>Whiskies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. Big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85"
1943,"<price>120<rating>82<whiskey>Longrow, 10 year old, 50%<review>This peated expression of Springbank is fresh, powerful, and unbridled. A brief, gristy, sweet malt intro quickly becomes quite aggressive, with an attack of tar, damp peat, kippers, mustard seed, Spanish olives, and Poire Williams. The sweetness emerges again briefly, before succumbing to an assertive, fiery finish. 
"
1944,"<price>150<rating>88<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 35 year old, 46.5%<review>Lighter in character than the 50 year old, batch 4 offers aromas of caramel, artisanal chocolate, red fruits, polished brogues, and a fluttering of Asian spices. It has plenty of personality, with molasses, chocolate treacle cake, date, fig, bramble, and black currant, though those spices return, and then it gets rather woody. A sprightly older blend, but beginning to show its age. (1,428 bottles)"
1945,"<price>51<rating>90<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) 27 year old, 56.3%<review>This slippery little rogue exudes sweet popcorn, lemon peel, summer florals, linseed, and Quaker Oats pillows adrift in a sea of butterscotch sauce. Rather tasty; the cask strength alcohol rips through the juicy mandarin and toffee opening, overcoming an active peppery middle section, then relinquishing its grip to leave herbal notes, corn, and fudge. Reverberating lengthy toffee and spice finish. Water brings out more cereal notes and soft orange."
1946,"<price>207<rating>85<whiskey>Littlemill 21 year old Second Release, 47%<review>This is a distillery bottling from the now-demolished Lowland plant of Littlemill, near Glasgow, and the release consists of 4,550 bottles. There has been no chill filtration. Fresh pineapple and mango on the nose, inflated balloons, a hint of vanilla, and cocoa powder. Medium-bodied, with focused tropical fruits, ginger, and caramel. Lengthy in the finish, with gentle spice and milk chocolate-coated toffee. £130"
1947,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>James E. Pepper Old Pepper 10 year old Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. L18V), 56.9%<review>Sweet confectionary aromas delight the nose with peach cobbler, sweet potato pie, chocolate wafer cookies, peanut shells, and toasted oak. It’s bright and lively on the palate, with excellent texture and balance; roasted pecans, dark chocolate, brown sugar, and tobacco leaf. Expressive fruit—grapes, cherries, blueberries, and blackberries—comes to the fore with a few drops of water, and it finishes full and rich, with pepper and baking spices, nutty chocolate, and drying oak."
1948,"<price>450<rating>91<whiskey>Port Askaig 25 year old, 45.8%<review>Remarkably fresh and fruity on the opening nose, then lively pineapple, mango, and peaches. Ashy woodsmoke lurks behind the fruit. Finally, brine and black pepper. Vibrant orchard fruits on the palate, with barbecue flavors that become peatier and spicier in time. Aniseed, lemon, tobacco, and tangy oak in the lengthy finish. (3,000 bottles for U.S. and Canada)"
1949,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Michter’s Limited Edition Barrel Strength Rye, 55.9%<review>Think of sitting on the front porch swing, legs up, a good song playing, and this smooth barrel strength rye. It’s an easy sipper, from the allspice and old-style licorice to the cadre of caramel and vanilla expressions that intertwine custard and German chocolate cake. You don’t expect sweetness, but it’s here, and lasting. If it has a weakness, it loses its intensity about mid-palate, but rebounds with a healthy medium-length finish."
1950,"<price>47<rating>89<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1989 vintage, 21 year old, 45%<review>A surprising amount of sweetness to balance the wood spice. Notes of pencil shavings, glazed fruit, candy corn, vanilla fudge, and bold polished leather on the finish."
1951,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>George Dickel Rye, 45%<review>A 5 year old rye whisky made in Lawrenceburg, Ind. (with the signature LDI 95% rye mashbill) that went through the Lincoln County Process after aging. A somewhat anemic nose, lightly grassy; sweet with edges of mint, vanilla, and oatmeal. The mouth is more rewarding; the rye’s bitter spice and sweet mint emerge to flame across the tongue. It’s very easy to drink, with a flare of oily mint intensity at the finish. Good, but you expect more from Dickel."
1952,"<price>299<rating>89<whiskey>Belfour Spirits Limited Edition Straight Rye, 50%<review>A nose of lemon drops, tea leaves, light barrel char, and herb-garden notes. The palate is honeyed, with lemon, licorice, herbs, and earthiness, balancing against vanilla cream and spice, all integrating well with the barrel. A lengthy finish is well-textured and spiced, highlighted by notes of tobacco, herbs, and chocolate. Creamy, spicy, and a bit unusual, this whiskey offers spiced complexity and impressive flavor balance on the palate."
1953,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>The Balvenie Single Barrel Sherry Cask 15 year old, 47.8%<review>Big sherry influence immediately, with walnut skin, raisin bread, and mixed peels. Seems pretty dry, and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. Balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown Demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor, mulch, nut, and dried berries. Just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. Water makes it more woody, with burlap, cacao, a little earthiness, and a slightly bitter exit."
1954,"<price>28<rating>76<whiskey>Lovell Bros. Georgia Sour Mash Whiskey, 43%<review>Light amber color; no age statement, not labeled as “straight whiskey.” Nose of spiced hard candies, wet oak, mint. Very hot mouth, thin body, muddled flavors of candy and wood. Quite young, with a hot, unpleasant finish. The unaged Lovell Bros. is both more enjoyable and more interesting."
1955,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label Highlands Origin, 42%<review>With Clynelish and Teaninich at its heart, this expression spotlights Black Label’s rich fruit character, with a nose of marmalade on well-done toast, nectarine, liquid honey, candied peel, dry spices, and bourbon biscuits. Rounded orange notes with creamy vanilla and peppery spices; the spices are amplified with touches of oak char as the marmalade flavors die back. Sweet, spicy, creamy finish of orange fondant."
1956,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey> That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old, 46.6%<review>Ovaltine, Whoppers, worn leather, antique furniture, medjool dates, and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity, it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry, joined by apple, pear, and sultana, with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2,000 bottles)"
1957,"<price>151<rating>82<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glenrothes) 1990, 49.4%<review>Light gold. From a refill bourbon cask, here we have more marzipan and some light maltiness alongside very fresh fruit and delicate vanilla. This is Rothes in slightly lean and hungry mode, with its signature fruits and spices in the background. Needs water to smooth things out. When that happens, there’s lemon drizzle cake, leafiness, and walnut flour. A little short on the finish.  £90"
1958,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Belle Meade Cask Strength Reserve (Batch No. 5), 56.8%<review>Oak, corn sweetness, and tropical fruit collide in this powerful bourbon that suggests grilled pineapple and charred corn on the cob. It handles the proof well, but be prepared for a no-holds-barred tongue lashing of licorice, bitter citrus pith, and oak, before a heaping spoonful of butterscotch pudding quells the heat. Reveals even more flavor with water—blueberry muffin, clove-studded orange, and cedar shingle."
1959,"<price>64<rating>92<whiskey>Shelter Point Double Barrel Single Malt, 50%<review>Two-row barley grown on the distillery farm yields a glorious dram, with berries instantly on the nose accompanying fragrant dry hay. The sweet fruitiness of the nose becomes clear overtones of wild Vancouver Island blackberries on the palate. This is big whisky, with exotic fruits, hot spices, and nutty, grainy marzipan notes. Restrained oak allows fruits and spices to shine. Slowly, a lingering spicy finish turns sweet and fruity. 85 CAD"
1960,"<price>820<rating>88<whiskey>Auchentoshan 1975, 45.6%<review>This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks, and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage, released in 2011. The nose is perfumed, with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate, with oranges and lemons, emerging spices, and benign oak. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. (500 bottles)"
1961,"<price>129<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Blair Athol) 20 year old, 51.5%<review>This single cask bottling was distilled in February 1993 and matured for 20 years in a sherry butt. Rich and spicy on the nose: peel, dates, and sultanas. More floral in time. A silky mouthfeel, major spice notes, ginger, and sweet sherry. Long in the finish, with nutmeg and plain chocolate cherry liqueur.£80"
1962,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Dogfish Head Straight Malt, 40%<review>Lots of confectionary notes on the nose: orange candy, bubble gum, marshmallow, meringue, nougat, and banana pudding, along with pine forest and clean mineral aromas. The chalky sweet palate brings to mind bagged marshmallows, banana candy, Toblerone, zingy lemon peel, and shelled pecans. More banana and lightly roasted nuts on the clean finish. Simple, innocuous, and easy to drink. Made with 100% malted barley and aged in toasted, lightly charred barrels."
1963,"<price>33<rating>83<whiskey>Firestone & Robertson TX Blended Whiskey, 41%<review>Sweet and simple from the start to finish, this whiskey shows best on the nose, with state-fair aromas of caramel corn, cotton candy, and bubble gum, as well as vanilla meringue and coconut cream pie. There’s a slightly harsh note on the palate, but it’s softened by vanilla, yellow cake with white frosting, and coconut. Very quick to finish."
1964,"<price>56<rating>84<whiskey>Hepburn’s Choice (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old, 46%<review>This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. Fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive) £45"
1965,"<price>130<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glenburgie) 1990 21 year old, 43%<review>Here’s a rarity. A major player in Ballantine’s, this Moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. Very gentle, sweet, and juicy start with licks of cream, a hint of barley, and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. In time, light almond and fresh lemon. The palate is lightly sticky — Glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla, malt, and a touch of toasty oak. Gentle, sweet, and refreshing. "
1966,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Murray McDavid 9 year old 1997 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 46%<review>An interesting application of Macallan, aged originally in a bourbon cask and then in Ridge Zinfandel barrels. Quite sweet and full-flavored, with ripe, jammy fruit, beach plum, subtle (yet deep) toffee, and grape skin, all laced with honey. Dynamic, fun, and carefree."
1967,"<price>49<rating>86<whiskey>Kavalan Distillery Reserve Peaty Cask, 55%<review>Whether it’s New York, London, Paris, or Yilan (home of Kavalan), this expression uses the fashionable technique of maturing unpeated spirit in former peaty whisky casks. Sweet, seasoned wood smoke, chocolate peat, dry spices (notably roasted coriander seed), citrus, and tropical fruits. A thick, warming, unctuous mouthfeel perfused with peat smoke, tangy grapefruit, and baked orange, ending on a fruity red licorice and gentle peat finish. Water unlocks moreish, honeyed citrus sweetness, with a peaty nip in the tail. (Distillery exclusive) NT$1,560"
1968,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Glenmorangie Tain L'Hermitage Wood Finish 1975 Vintage, 46%<review>For those of you drinking whisky long enough, it was a Glenmorangie Tain L’Hermitage 1978 Vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by Glenmorangie about 10 years ago. That one wasn’t sold here in the U.S., but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). Both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in Hermitage red wine casks from northern Rhone. The best of these limited release Glenmorangies, like the Fino Sherry Finish expression several years ago, add complexity and intrigue without masking Glenmorangie’s lovely subtle complexity. This one does a pretty good job of it, although there’s a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine). Complex fruit, with notes of plum, raspberry, nectarine, blueberries, and a hint of lemon. Underneath the fruit, there’s nougat, dark chocolate and cocoa. Towards the finish, the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate."
1969,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Penderyn Myth, 43%<review>Fresh fruits, satsuma peel, lime zest, pear, lemon meringue pie, and a cheeky burst of spices in this red wine and American oak bourbon barrel-finished whisky. Marshmallow softness, with apple, cooked Jell-O, and cherry slam into fruit-skin bitterness, chicory root, and aniseed, descending into spicy bitter fruit flavors. This perks the palate up no end. Oak seems to hold stronger cards than the wine soaked into the staves."
1970,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Forged Oak 15 year old, 45.25%<review>The fifth release in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series (and the youngest of the releases so far). Distilled at the “new” Bernheim distillery and, once again, matured most recently in Stitzel-Weller warehouses. Complex flavors are well-integrated, with lovely spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, mint, nutmeg), nougat, caramel, and subtle fruit. Long, satisfying finish. Not as distinctive as some previous Orphan Barrel releases, but more rounded and balanced. Nicely done!"
1971,"<price>60<rating>95<whiskey>Crown Royal Noble Collection 13 year old Blenders’ Mash, 45%<review>If Canada made bourbon (it doesn’t), it would taste like this massive dram. The mashbill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley is identical to that used for Crown Royal Hand Selected Barrel Coffey rye. Beer still distillation and virgin oak barrels yield huge vanillas, rye spices, barrel tones, cherries, dark fruits, soaring floral esters, and gingery, peppery spices. Strong woodiness, slightly pulling tannins, and something almost chocolaty."
1972,"<price>110<rating>96<whiskey>Jefferson’s Presidential Select, 18 year old, 47%<review>Unlike the standard “small batch” releases, this is from a single barrel: a really good single barrel. I rated the 18 year old small batch a 93 in the last issue, and I like this one even better. There’s less wood getting in the way. It’s softer, more elegant. Lovely fruit, gently sweet (black raspberry jam, blueberry pie), with nougat, creamy vanilla, a sprinkling of cinnamon, and polished leather on the finish. And so drinkable. Classic stuff!"
1973,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Devils River Texas Rye, 45%<review>Orange rind, pineapple, and tropical aromas on the nose. The palate has notes of chocolate milkshake, with nuttiness and a hint of espresso. Water brings out more tropical flavors, bitter chocolate, and a light char note. A bit hot, but the finish is balanced and reasonably long—chocolaty, lemony, with more of the charred note and some tobacco leaf. Not quite as full-bodied as it might be, but a solid rye expression nonetheless."
1974,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Four Roses Small Batch, 45%<review>Oak-driven nose, where dusty oak floorboard meets light brown sugar and some herbal notes. On the palate this delivers tropical fruits, with hints of banana and papaya, and features a nice slick mouthfeel that succumbs to drying tannins, ending with nutty qualities and earthy forest floor. Simple and easy to enjoy."
1975,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Oban 14 year old, 43%<review>The nose is floral, with honey, toffee, cereal, and a hint of smoke, but subtle maritime notes are also present. The palate is rich and relatively complex: spicy, with citrus fruit, more cereal, seaweed, peat smoke, and oak. Lengthy in the finish, with toffee, new leather, and perpetual spice. A long-standing favorite with a very distinctive profile."
1976,"<price>250<rating>95<whiskey>Dram Hunters 7 year old Southern Coast Distillers Single Cask Single Malt (Cask No. 112), 63.6%<review>Without water, this oddball is deeply herbaceous and spiced with aniseed, coriander, hardwood smoke, brown sugar, and powerful oak throughout the nose and palate. Add some water, and suddenly the sunbeam breaks through the crack in the curtain. There are still plenty of herbal and spice notes, but now more dimension emerges—orange, forest fruits, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee ice cream, and sweet woodsmoke, fully relaxed in its integration. The finish is savory, then sweet—clean and rich, a revelation. (150 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
1977,"<price>11<rating>74<whiskey>Canadian Leaf, 40%<review>The loyalty to Canadian Leaf shown by some rye-and-coke drinkers in the Northeastern border states speaks to the broad appeal of whisky in general. With creamy caramel, toffee, sweet burnt sugar, and a pleasant, spice-fired warmth, it makes a great mixing whisky. A certain sharpness and spirity overtones render it less interesting as a sipper. Simple, flawless, and well-executed, but not particularly exciting, this is the light Canadian whisky of yesteryear."
1978,"<price>150<rating>85<whiskey>Elijah Craig 20 year old (Barrel No. 3742), 45%<review>The second 20 year old single barrel release, sold at Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center. (I rated the first one a 96.) Like its predecessor, this one sports a beautiful nose — and beginning of the palate — with toffee, nougat, pecan pie, and coconut truffle. But some fairly aggressive, tactile oak on the finish keeps this whiskey from earning a higher rating."
1979,"<price>1348<rating>89<whiskey>Highland Park Thorfinn, 45.1%<review>More obviously sherried on the nose than either Sigurd or Ragnvald; buttery, with figs, sultanas, vanilla, a hint of leather, and ripe oranges. Rich and silky on the complex palate; overt sherry, ginger, and lots of old leather and sweet smoke. Spice is quite muted here. The finish is lengthy, with plain chocolate, wood smoke, figs, and tingling spices. Luxurious and accomplished. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €1,000"
1980,"<price>540<rating>90<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1971 (Cask #3546), 51.1%<review>Sherry butt once more, but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think Montgomery Clift seducing Elizabeth Taylor rather than De Niro chatting up Liza Minelli. Sweetness is the key here, gentle and slightly caramelized, with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. The palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. Great balance.£382"
1981,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Grooves, 46%<review>The 2018 Ardbeg Day limited-edition bottling includes a proportion of spirit matured in red wine casks which have been heavily charred, leaving deep grooves in the surface of the oak. Fragrant soft smoke, warm leather, and salty red berries on the nose; background charcuterie. The palate offers red berry fruits, vanilla, dense peat smoke, brine, and asphalt. Beach bonfires and black pepper in the sweet finish."
1982,"<price>74<rating>87<whiskey>Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 1, 46%<review>Assorted mashes and barrels ensure each batch of Two Brewers malt whisky is unique. When mature, about 7 years later, these are blended into multi-layered whiskies. Sweet, crisp nose, then Cheerios, dry grain, and fresh malt. Vague herbal tones balance hints of ripe fruit. Bright palate with gingery peppers sprinkled on fall fruit—soft apples, plums, peaches. Lush body, then a slight woody, tannic pull. (Canada only) C$95"
1983,"<price>50<rating>72<whiskey>Wieser Wiesky Sherry Wood 7 year old, 40%<review>A quadruple-distilled whisky in a glass-stoppered bottle, the sherry influence has left its mark on the nose with ripe Victoria plums, glacé cherry, ripening strawberries, icing sugar, and mixed peel. Too bad the flavors are profoundly bitter and minty, producing an expression on this reviewer’s face like a flinching child reluctantly ingesting an unwelcome spoonful of medicine. More palatable and fruity as it dilutes, some spearmint returns on the finish, but it was game over by then."
1984,"<price>1000<rating>87<whiskey>Bowmore Mizunara Cask Finish, 53.9%<review>It’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in Japanese oak (mizunara) casks is from Beam Suntory-owned Bowmore. It’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla, spice, and incense notes of mizunara and Bowmore’s distillery characteristics. You get rich peat, black pepper, apricot, and peach all playing alongside each other. The palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests, with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in."
1985,"<price>15<rating>79<whiskey>Canadian Mist Black Diamond, 43%<review>Richer, sweeter (with more caramelized sugars), fruitier, and spicier than the standard Canadian Mist (reviewed below). Still, I wish it were a bit smoother (especially on the finish) for something I would consider drinking neat on a regular basis. There’s no age statement, but a couple more years of aging would be nice. Like the flagship Canadian Mist, this whisky still plays it fairly conservatively — not a lot of risk-taking here. But I think it’s slightly better than Crown Royal Black (its logical competitor) which is not as smooth on the finish, and you can get Black Diamond for half the price."
1986,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Penderyn Legend, 43%<review>This madeira-finished whisky delivers a beautiful combination of crunchy red apple, dried apple rings, toasted oak, cubes of vanilla fudge, honey, and dabs of orange. It’s a friendly dram and it draws you in; attractive but not flashy or abundantly fragrant. Soft fruits, though not instantly sweet, accompanied by vegetal notes, almonds, and some spicy bitterness, with ginger, pepper, and clove encircling the tongue."
1987,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin Caribbean Rum 2007, 46%<review>This 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in Caribbean rum barrels. Quite delicate on the nose, with wet grass, then emerging coconut and whipped cream. Slick on the palate, with an instant tropical fruit hit—ripe banana and pineapple—plus more cream, cinnamon, and hazelnut. Spicy and nutty in the finish, with a final tropical fruit tang (6,600 bottles) £40"
1988,"<price>98<rating>86<whiskey>Cadenhead's, (distilled at Rosebank), 11 year old, 57.5%<review>Gold color. Soft, delicate aroma of fruit gum drops, vanilla, and a touch of honey. Light in body, with a soft texture. Its flavors are like its aroma, nicely balanced, with a gentle finish. 
"
1989,"<price>151<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenturret) 1987, 51.5%<review>This Glenturret was bottled in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular series at 28 years old. After maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. Malt, milk chocolate, and honey on the pleasing, mature, rounded nose. Figs and sultanas develop in time. Smooth and rich on the palate with more malt, cocoa powder, and soft spices. Very long in the finish with quite insistent spice, citrus fruit, cloves, and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105"
1990,"<price>68<rating>79<whiskey>Belgian Owl 4 year old, cask L140211, 46%<review>This is very different to previous Belgian Owl bottlings, but it’s important because it takes the distillery to a new place. There are hints of Glen Garioch or Springbank here, with green banana skin, raw barley, and some peppery tomato. The fruity center just about survives the onslaught, but it’s not an easy ride. €47 Currently not available in the U.S."
1991,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Gold, 18 year old, 40%<review>An example that older, more expensive isn’t always better, this 18 year old gem is as good as many blends twice its price. The foundation of Johnnie Walker Gold is delicate, clean, and honeyed, along with a fresh sea character (from Clynelish?) that provides a youthful zing. Notes of vanilla, shortbread, tropical fruit, freshly cut hay, marshmallow, and even a hit of peat, round out the palate. Its finish is subtly complex and nicely balanced. The blend has improved nicely over the past several years. 
"
1992,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Big Bottom Barlow Trail Whiskey, 45.5%<review>Big Bottom has made their name finishing sourced whiskeys. Now they’re experimenting with a blend of undisclosed whiskeys in a bourbon base. The result is a riff on Canadian-style whisky. Dark gold in color, the nose is light oak, caramel, cinnamon, and cherry. On the palate it’s a pleasant mix of creamy vanilla, oak, and cinnamon. A medium finish features light charred oak and black pepper spice. A unique approach to the style, one that manages to really work."
1993,"<price>260<rating>94<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 23 year old Ben Nevis 1996 Single Cask (Cask No. 1479), 52.7%<review>Thick with sherry fruit on the nose: cooked dark berries, raisins, and dried figs, though the fruit becomes more jammy when water is added. There’s also dark chocolate, hazelnuts, and leather. The palate is equally thick and chewy, offering figs, raisins, dark chocolate, coffee bean, and raspberry cake filling, as well as green apple and guava candy showing this whisky’s maturity. It finishes with coffee, chocolate, dark berries, white pepper, orange pith, and oak that verges on bitterness, but never tips over the edge. Stately and dignified. (405 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
1994,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Shays’ Rebellion American Whiskey, 43%<review>Triple-distilled whiskey from Samuel Adams Cinder Bock beer, aged 3.5 years in Samuel Adams Utopias casks. Definite character of strong beer to the nose, very light smoke, some mixed fruit notes. Mellow smoke on the tongue, broad malt and fruit (prune plum, dried cherry, baked apple), a luxurious feel. Finish is slow and even. Flavorful, but not heavy or shouting. The casks have had a great effect here, but the distilling is skillfully done."
1995,"<price>72<rating>85<whiskey>Littlemill 21 year old Burns Malt, 55.1%<review>Online retailer TheWhiskyBarrel.com has released 60 bottles of 21 year old single malt from the now-lost Lowland distillery of Littlemill. Maturation has taken place in a sherry hogshead and cask #35 yielded 306 bottles, with the balance being held by whiskybroker.co.uk. The nose is rich and thick, with old sherry, caramel, and cinnamon, while the full palate boasts aniseed, pipe tobacco, and an effervescence that is unusual in a whisky of this age. The finish is lengthy, with drying sherry notes. "
1996,"<price>10<rating>81<whiskey>Gooderham’s Bonded Stock, 40%<review>Bonded Stock was a Gooderham and Worts brand until Harry Hatch moved production to Windsor during Prohibition. Dry grain with hints of bicycle tires on the nose become barley sugar and fiery pepper on the palate. Simple with a delicate balance of hot ginger, licorice root, spearmint, savory herbs, watery caramel, and mild ripe fruit, ending with a refreshing bitter tinge. Old-time hard-rye mixing whisky, but go ahead, sneak a wee sip."
1997,"<price>54<rating>86<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at BenRiach) 12 year old 1994 vintage, 59.5%<review>A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they're equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny's Beverage Depot exclusive)"
1998,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Egan’s 16 year old Legacy Reserve II, 46%<review>The Pyrenean dessert wine-cask finish brings citrus, candy hearts, apricot, and cooking apple peelings to the nose, with hints of aniseed, allspice, and macadamia nuts. Fizzy orange, singed peel, fruit tarts, and honey initially, though it’s pretty feisty with pepper, aniseed, and allspice. Milk chocolate, apple, and malt biscuits glide into the finish, where the spices fade but the fruit remains juicy and sweet. (1,000 bottles)"
1999,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Glasgow Blend, 43%<review>A ripe proposition, the fruit and the smoke locked tightly together like interwoven fingers. Peaches, melon, baked apple, fresh mango, and sugar strands with a supporting role of red berries. With a malt content exceeding two-thirds, the full-bodied palate is sweet as brown sugar, with mandarin tartness, apple, and red licorice meandering to a vinous finish of red berry fruit. With its cheeky Glasgow landmark on the label, this permanent addition to the GKS range is pure gallus."
2000,"<price>74<rating>84<whiskey>Glen Ord, Milroy’s of Soho Single Cask, 1999, 46%<review>A Glen Ord bottled by the London wine and spirits establishment of Milroy’s, and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this Diageo-owned distillery. The nose initially presents lemon zest, then peaches and caramel, with cream soda notes. Very fruity and lively in the mouth, with a nutty, malty undercurrent. Medium in length; firm, with spicy fruit lasting to the very end, accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 Currently not available in the U.S."
2001,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Glenturret Sherry Edition, 46%<review>Principally matured in bourbon casks, this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. Sweet wood polish on the nose, with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with vanilla, spicy milk chocolate, sultanas, and some earthiness. The finish is medium in length, with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47"
2002,"<price>67<rating>89<whiskey>Cragganmore Distillers Edition 1997, 43%<review>Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. Sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me, the pick of the bunch."
2003,"<price>120<rating>88<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #17B302), 47.2%<review>Initially there’s a lot going on. Bakery confectionary meets spice rack, followed by dried oak, toasted oak, covered baked apples, canned peaches, and dried apricot. Then tobacco and leather strike before mouth-coating butterscotch and vanilla icing. Once these notes dissipate, lighter baked fruits and jams walk this into a medium finish. While good, this whiskey could have been great if it maintained its initial complexity."
2004,"<price>132<rating>87<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Tycho’s Star, 41.8%<review>Named after a supernova, not the Seven Stars, this uses a mashbill of pale ale, chocolate, and heavily-peated malt, with three specific cask specifications. Toffee apple, cotton candy, gentle leaf smoke, dry seasoned logs, cacao, vanilla seeds, and ripe bananas. A lighter mouthfeel with juicy sweetness, mixed peel, cinnamon, dry banana chips, mild ginger, chocolate notes, and cocoa. The finish feels short, then out of left field it hits you with a surging wave of chocolate and coffee."
2005,"<price>20000<rating>94<whiskey>Ardbeg 1974 Vintage (Cask #3524), 49.9%<review>Cask #3524 is darker, with notes of sticky toffee pudding and chewy caramel that firmly support the polished leather, cigar box, roasted chestnut, smoked seaweed, tar, dark chocolate, and, on the finish, espresso. A meditative whisky. Price listed includes entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set."
2006,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie Cote de Nuits Finish 1975, 43%<review>Amber color with shades of chestnut. Full, complex aromas of fruit (cherries, currants, berries), marzipan, Demerara sugar, roasted nuts, and molasses. Full in body, with flavors that deliver what its aroma promised. Satisfying finish."
2007,"<price>9420<rating>93<whiskey>Glenfarclas 1953, 47.2%<review>The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness, but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop, rowan berry, and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house. Mysterious, subtle, and highly complex. £5,995"
2008,"<price>24<rating>87<whiskey>Alberta Springs 10 year old, 40%<review>Skilled whisky makers know many different ways to achieve a particular flavor profile. So when someone mentions rye, don’t ask the percentage, ask how it was made. Why? Because sometimes Alberta Springs is made entirely from rye grain, and sometimes it isn’t. And not even trained tasters can tell. Crisp yet silky with skillfully integrated rye spices riding waves of white pepper. Fruity, sweet vanilla, citrus zest, flaxseed, and dusty rye delivered in fresh-cut lumber. (Canada only) C$24"
2009,"<price>27<rating>79<whiskey>West Cork Original Classic Blend, 40%<review>Cinnamon bark, oak, overripe nectarines, salted peanuts, and faint herbal notes open up this blended whiskey housed in the bottle with the clever geographical label. The structure starts light on the first sip, with Golden Delicious apples and honey lozenges, but then it thickens up mid-palate when the spiciness kicks in. Then it peters out. A decent spicy buzz finishes this perfectly serviceable blend composed by these determined newcomers to the Irish whiskey scene."
2010,"<price>30<rating>70<whiskey>Kansas Clean Distilled, 40%<review>Clear, slight golden hue; as expected from a 7% straight whiskey/93% grain neutral spirit “spirit whiskey.” Faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol. Thickly sweet in the mouth, with barely a hint of whiskey, like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka. While there are no glaring flaws in the make, this is simply a bad idea. Light whiskey failed once, in the 1970s, and for good reasons. Those reasons haven't changed."
2011,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Colkegan Cask Strength Single Malt, 59%<review>Mesquite-smoked New Mexico single malt. Rich and beefy on the nose: charred brisket, salted meat, tangerines, dark wood, brine, and white smoke. The palate is powerful, oak-forward without being astringent, and very spicy. Walnut, cayenne pepper, and grilled citrus balance out the meaty, oaky flavors. Saddle leather, cherries, and even more smoke on the finish. Tangy, salty, spicy, and malty. A truly compelling American single malt with great structure."
2012,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Kilchoman 2006 vintage 5 year old, 46%<review>It often takes time for a new distillery to find its feet, but Kilchoman’s spirit was top quality from the first day. Its limited-edition releases act as markers on a work in progress, but are precociously advanced for their tender years. This, the first 5 year old, leads with a note like wet rushes/wet dog (that’s good!) alongside lightly turfy smoke. The palate is sweet, smoked, and thick with allspice on the finish. A star is born."
2013,"<price>124<rating>84<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Seven Stars No. 1 Dubhe, 45%<review>In the Straits of Øresund, between Denmark and Sweden, sits the beautiful island of Hven. This is the first in a series of seven whiskies to mark the brightest stars of the Big Dipper asterism. Candied peel, walnut shells, warm marmalade, vanilla pods, and haylofts intermingle before Red Delicious apples shoulder in. It’s a lively, youthful dram of baked orange, milk chocolate, and vanilla tablet with a touch of pear. Best neat, as water subtracts from the experience. €90"
2014,"<price>155<rating>90<whiskey>Alfred Giraud Heritage, 45.9%<review>A marriage of three malts matured in cognac casks and new French and American oak brings a nose of fresh Bartlett pear, vanilla, white pepper, cognac, zested lime, and a rainbow of pâtes de fruits flavors. White fruits, fresh banana, cantaloupe, apricot, orange, and light spices; the cognac notes yield to let the sweetness of the pear shine through. Short spice finish with melon and slight grapefruit bitterness. (675 bottles for the U.S.)"
2015,"<price>1300<rating>92<whiskey>The Dalmore, 1981 Vintage Amoroso Finish, 42%<review>A seductive Dalmore. Very fruity too, with Seville orange, peaches in syrup, clementine, pineapple, and bramble. Sugared almond, powdered vanilla, ginger, and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. Consistent on the nose and palate, and with great balance. I’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. I feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. Very lovely!"
2016,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>The Lakes The One Orange Wine Cask-Finished, 46.6%<review>

Mandarin, breakfast pastries, lemon meringue pie, warm peach, sweet grapefruit halves, and a fine layer of spices on the nose make for an appealing introduction. Baked orange, sweet fudge, and pepper on first sip, with later development of grilled pineapple, vanilla, and dried mango. With its instantly likeable flavors, this is a great recruiting whisky for new drinkers, though the palate development has its limitations. £48"
2017,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Glen Fohdry Làn-abaich 21 year old Speyside, 47.1%<review>Though the name means “rich and mellow,” this whisky offers fresh, clean aromas: honeysuckle and lilies; melon, lemon, and lime; hay and grass, a sunlit meadow. Sweet and zingy on the palate, with lemon oil, guava candy, blueberry, strawberry, gentle spice, milk chocolate, and walnuts. More spice on the finish, with polished oak and dried fruit. Well constructed, supple, and easy to enjoy. (Total Wine & More)"
2018,"<price>180<rating>86<whiskey>Royal Salute The Eternal Reserve, 40%<review>Let me introduce you to infinity blending. 88 casks were blended and married in 88 casks for 6 months, then blended with another 88 casks. Half is bottled, and half retained at Strathisla’s Royal Salute vault for the next batch. The process is as fascinating as the whisky. Caramel, toffee, green apple, Jaffa orange, and vanilla pod aromas. Dark sweetness, fresh orange accents: polished, juicy, and thirst quenching, though the brilliance lies in the amaranthine finish. (Global Travel Retail only)"
2019,"<price>49<rating>81<whiskey>Palm Ridge Rye Whiskey, 50%<review>Starts off quite confectionary, with sweet top notes of vanilla, crème caramel, and violets. The palate flaunts its brash youth, showing lots of primary, new make whiskey character, while carrying its 100 proof surprisingly well for such a young whiskey (aged less than 1 year), as the cereal grain, cinnamon spice, generous sweetness, and charcoal power through the palate. Young, potent, and unapologetic."
2020,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Broken Top Bourbon, 43.7%<review>Made at Oregon’s Cascade Street Distillery and purporting to be “mountain-style” bourbon, this whiskey presents a mix of herbal and fruity aromas to start, along with baking spice, brown sugar, and vanilla frosting. The palate is light-bodied but rich in oak, roasted nut, dried chili, cocoa powder, and cigar, with dried flower notes when water is added; plenty of oak and dark chocolate on the finish."
2021,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Knappogue Castle Twin Wood 16 year old, 40%<review>The latest limited release from this brand. This whiskey spent most of its life aging in a bourbon barrel and then spent 9 months in sherry casks. (“Twin wood” is synonymous with “finishing.”) This one’s triple distilled (think Bushmills distillery) and is the first Knappogue Castle to be aged in two types of wood. It’s a very nice whiskey, with an array of bright fruit lying on a bed of creamy vanilla, toasted nuts, marshmallow, marzipan, and powdered cocoa. Excluding the original 1951 Knappogue Castle release (from the long gone B. Daly distillery), this is my favorite of the “modern day” Knappogue Castle whiskeys."
2022,"<price>17<rating>65<whiskey>Chinook Limited Edition Signature Rye Whisky, 44.9%<review>With its overt floral perfume notes and the scent of children’s powdered candy, this whisky is difficult to enjoy. Its unctuous artificial flavors are equally unsuitable for cocktails, mixing, or sipping. Fruity, winey, lavender notes duke it out with baby cereal and artificial coconut. The saving graces? A late lovely bitterness, long gingery burn, and creamy body. But then jujubes, grape gum and artificial bananas kick in and it’s over."
2023,"<price>125<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Vintage Strawberry Punnet (distilled at Invergordon) 1988, 46%<review>I’m playfully perplexed as to whether the titular “vintage” refers to an elderly strawberry or an aged punnet. Undaunted, this example from the Highland powerhouse noses much better than promised with fresh mint, small, tight strawberry buds, sandy loam, and a saccharine sweetness. It has a sweet, syrupy, fat flavor, in turn revealing caramel, buttery notes, white chocolate, vanilla, and black currant. A satisfying finish of browning butter and warm chestnuts. (242 bottles) £82"
2024,"<price>82<rating>87<whiskey>Longrow Red 11 year old Port Cask, 51.8%<review>The latest incarnation of Springbank’s Longrow Red matured for 11 years in port casks before being bottled at cask strength. The nose is sweet, with cherries, caramel, new leather, chewing tobacco, and soft peat. Voluptuous in the mouth, with a palate of rich peat, summer berries, and toffee apples, with growing spice notes, and light oak. Lengthy in the finish, with cinnamon, peat, sweet oak, and red berries."
2025,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Arbikie Highland Rye, 46%<review>This single-estate rye whisky, Scotland’s first rye in over a century, lets you lose yourself in deep clove spiciness, dark chocolate, Brazil nut, orange peel, and aromas of pressed cigars. The flavor is astonishingly good, with marmalade, old-fashioned toffee, rye bread, and toasted malt biscuits before a shower of clove spices breaks through, with dark toffee, treacle, chocolate, and pepper leading into a long finish of toffee and spice."
2026,"<price>28<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Ness 12 year old Highland, 40%<review>Classic sherry aromas of raisins, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, and cooked plums prime the palate, but pay attention: a hint of peat is there, presenting beautifully as smoke and saline, along with sweet almond, gingerbread, chocolate-covered raisins, and hazelnuts. The finish is wispy, with oak, cigar, and dark chocolate flavors. (Total Wine & More)"
2027,"<price>3500<rating>94<whiskey>The John Walker, 40%<review>The pinnacle of the current Johnnie Walker range, this is a rare, inimitable blend of just nine whiskies. It exudes the aromas of ripe bananitos, whole mango, satsuma, vanilla seeds, barley awns, butter biscuits, and crystallized pineapple. The supple grain sustains indulgent, characterful malts creating a weighty, smooth mouthfeel. I’m smitten by the vanilla creaminess, burgeoning deep fruit layers, how it swells with a satisfying snuffbox smokiness. A beautifully styled blend delivering a captivating, sensuous experience. (330 bottles only)"
2028,"<price>35<rating>92<whiskey>Bernheim Original Single Barrel 7 year old Straight Wheat, 45%<review>This select bottling of Bernheim Original comes from Warehouse Y on the 4th floor, and is non-chill filtered. Without the filtering, the nose is notably more expressive and becomes a real showcase for wheat grain, oak spice, caramel, and citrus. On the palate, this whiskey maintains a firm balance between soft and strong, with supple wheat grain entwined with caramel, oak, and cinnamon spice. A long, flavorful finish caps off a well-curated selection of an excellent whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
2029,"<price>145<rating>82<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at BenRiach) 1996, 46.5%<review>Once again, some assertive distillery character to the fore which, in BenRiach’s case, means plenty of ripe sweet fruits, cooked apples, a jag of citrus, and a background malty note. There’s a pleasant, slightly oxidative, wine-like note with water. The sweetness dominates the palate, with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and, in typical BenRiach fashion, a sweet spiced finish. Lovely, but not overly different from official bottlings."
2030,"<price>236<rating>87<whiskey>Overeem Sherry Matured, 43%<review>This second, standard-strength version of Casey Overeem’s sherry pair bears toffee apple, cherry loaf, prune juice, and aged Aceto Balsamico Di Modena on the nose, adding a rewarding depth of flavor. It’s rich, full-bodied, and clings to the teeth like a mollusk to a rock during a storm over the South East Cape. A late-night dram of cherry flesh, Brazil nut, ground cinnamon, whole clove, and cacao that dissipates into a relaxing finish of well-worn leather and wax cherry lips. £140"
2031,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>The Clan Denny Single Grain (distilled at Cambus) 35 year old, 54.2%<review>Very typical of old grain whiskies: light in body and floral, with soothing vanilla and a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin in syrup, honey-kissed pineapple, banana, and coconut cream). The better examples, like this one, are not dominated by dry oak on the finish. Subtle spices (ginger, cocoa powder) add intrigue. Old grain whiskies are hard to find but worth exploring. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
2032,"<price>66<rating>90<whiskey>West Cork Rum Cask Finish 12 year old, 43%<review>The bright, sunny welcome of the rum cask greets you as you raise the glass to your nose. Honeycomb, golden syrup, fresh bread, and dry, powdered-spice aromas. The satin smooth palate boasts sweet melon and honey, developing caramel and orange oils, with a tail that turns slightly nutty. Worth a comparative tasting against Teeling Small Batch, this is an Irish whiskey to take you through the summer."
2033,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Powers John’s Lane 12 year old, 46%<review>Brooding, primal, and robust thanks to its fat, rolling, oily notes, slightly fermenting Bramley apples, oolong tea, green banana, hint of sherry, and purposeful delivery of allspice, peppercorns, and star anise. The fruit and chocolate stay one step ahead of the spices; orange, chocolate, coffee, apricot, boiled candy, marmalade on buttered toast, and barley sugar meet a finish of heavier spices, bitter chocolate, and dusty cocoa. Unmistakable, epic whiskey."
2034,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Wiser’s One Fifty Commemorative Series, 43.4%<review>Sweet, lush, and creamy with hints of banana cream pie, maple syrup, and mild vanilla, then spicy hard candy, new barrels, and a wealth of creamy, fruity aromas tightly integrated. Caramely cough drops melt into sweet baking spices. The mouthfeel stays creamy, as hot spices emerge. Complex, balanced, and very quaffable. The long finish is sweet, with peppers and cereal notes. Bottle numbers correspond to individual weeks since Confederation. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$50"
2035,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Baker’s Single Barrel (No. 000185706), 53.5%<review>Poor Baker Beam, great-nephew of Jim Beam. His eponymous Baker’s bourbon ended up a sleeper bottle alongside rightfully lauded Booker’s bourbon and stellar limited editions of Knob Creek. But this year, Baker’s has reason to boast, as it gets the single-barrel treatment. It will remain 107 proof and a minimum of 7 years old. However, the addition of details like barreling date, age, warehouse, and barrel number will make for fun treasure hunting. Our bottle offered a lush palate of blackberries, delicious dried fruits, licorice, and cinnamon. Number 16 in the 2019 Top 20 "
2036,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Compass Box Oak Cross, 43%<review>A blend of three different single malts. Its name derives from the fact that the whisky is aged in American oak bodies with French Oak heads (a cross of both oaks). There’s no age statement, but the whiskies are all older than ten years. This is a gentle, subtly complex, somewhat lithe, easy drinking whisky (and with less oak spice than its predecessor, The Spice Tree). People think whisky is an after-dinner drink, but I think this would make a great aperitif because of its delicate dry spice notes and light body. I’m picking up evenly-proportioned notes of vanilla and coconut, with more subtle notes of clove, anise, and delicate fruit, all wrapped up in a gentle, malty body. A very versatile whisky.

2037,"<price>133<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Deanston, Cask 10,426) 1994, 51.7%<review>Distilled in June 1994, this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87"
2038,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>Dalwhinnie, 29 year old, 57.8%<review>Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Quite fruity (especially apples). Hint of honey and caramel with subtle background oak. Prickling alcohol before the addition of water. Palate: Smooth and mouth-coating. Nicely balanced. Delicately honeyed fruit notes up from, followed by oak and toffee, becoming dry and spicy with pleasant lingering oak. 
"
2039,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Benromach 1999 Vintage  (Cask No. 613), 58.6%<review>This cask-strength whisky turns cloudy with the addition of water. Nice balance of both moderate sherry and smoke, with underlying fruit gum drops, shortbread, charcoal, black licorice, and subtle herbs. An assertive whiskey. The flavors aren’t as crisp as I would like, but pretty good for seven years old. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
2040,"<price>94<rating>89<whiskey>Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Mortlach) 1989 21 year old, 48%<review>Immediately identifiable as Mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. The palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60"
2041,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Ruby Cask, 40%<review>The port cask finish wraps the toffee and baked orange in an extra layer of richness. There is subtlety in the aroma of the port notes, with red cherry and dried cranberry mingling with well-integrated spices in the background. Richer dark caramels infused with red fruits, including cranberry, red currant, and pomegranate, chased by feisty spices. The finish has concentrated red fruit juices, nougat, and long-lasting spices."
2042,"<price>600<rating>91<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 20 year old Ardbeg Single Cask (Distilled in 2001; Cask No. 1-93), 51.8%<review>

At first whiff, the nose is classic Islay peat: kelp and kippers, with the rubbery pop of new vinyl couch cushions. Add a little water, and fresh lemon and grapefruit burst from the glass: a welcome surprise. The oily palate highlights both—abundant saline peat and zippy citrus—with a tingle of white pepper that lingers in the nose well into the finish, which also has roasted walnuts, nori, ash, and oak. (192 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2043,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism Quindecimus, 46%<review>How time flies! This eloquent blended grain marks CBWC’s 15th anniversary and the combination of these aged grains is idiosyncratic of whisky auteur John Glaser’s distinctive taste. Rich honey, apricot stone, crisp spices, vanilla custard, gentle oak char, and tropical fruits promise a real reward. Succulently juicy, with melon, apple, and caramel, subtly paced, with chocolate and dark fruit infiltrating. Slowly the sweetness depletes to black pepper and spiced roast meats. Defer swallowing for as long as possible. (5,689 bottles)"
2044,"<price>665<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1989, 43%<review>The second release from Glenmorangie’s Bond House No. 1 Collection, this 27 year old includes whisky from a parcel of casks that received a period of secondary maturation in Côte-Rôtie red wine casks. Honey and nectarines on the nose, plus ginger, icing sugar, and damp heather. A silky palate delivery of peaches in cream, apple crumble, nutmeg, and white pepper. The finish is lengthy, with lingering spicy orange notes."
2045,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Master of Malt Boxes Blend, 40.9%<review>Master of Malt is an online whisky company that seems to try its hand at most things and is bringing a fresh irreverence to the world of whisky. This was created in partnership with the bass guitarist of British rock band Athlete, and it's rather good. Sweet and rich with toffee, orange chocolate, and honey, it's another blend with a lot to say for itself.  £55"
2046,"<price>22<rating>85<whiskey>Bain’s Cape Mountain Single Grain Whisky, 46%<review>South Africa may be home to an increasingly impressive wine industry — and a noted brandy producer — but the country is also home to two whisky distilleries. Drayman’s in Pretoria is run by brewer Moritz Kallmeyer, while the James Sedgwick distillery in Wellington is home to Three Ships and Bain’s Cape Mountain Grain. Bain’s was created by distiller Andy Watts as a way to attract the new, female drinker. Sweet and succulent, this is like an alcohol ice cream sundae — fudge chunks, toffee, and butterscotch syrup, not to mention the ice cream, You pile on the pounds just smelling it. A lush beauty."
2047,"<price>35<rating>91<whiskey>Chivas Regal 13 year old Manchester United Limited Edition, 40%<review>Bottled in recognition of Sir Alex Ferguson’s remarkable thirteen league soccer titles, this scotch does him proud. Juicy citrus, aromatic spices, and vanilla pudding; the nose is enveloped with milk chocolate aromas and further spiciness. The blend was selectively finished in American rye barrels, and the flavors crescendo through orange, malt, chocolate, mint, and pepper, with some rye spices that usher in a lengthy, spicy finish. Blissfully good. Best Value"
2048,"<price>88<rating>83<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Br2 (distilled at Bruichladdich), 49.3%<review>The second bottling from Bruichladdich in this range shows the ‘traditional‘ side of a distillery that is famed for the variety of its expressions. This, in other words, is Bruichladdich in its sweet, honeyed, gentle guise partnered with American oak to produce a mashed banana character, an unctuous palate, and a light touch of almond on the finish. Lovely. £55 (500 ml)"
2049,"<price>40<rating>81<whiskey>Wood’s High Mountain Tenderfoot (Batch 29), 45%<review>Despite the orange-amber color, green, stalky corn husk and bramble notes dominate this youngster, with secondary flavors of fruitwood smoke and warm cereal. The flavors are beginning to evolve nicely on the palate, as the fresh malt meets lots of dark chocolate before a savory snap of green stick returns on the finish. Malted barley, malted rye, and malted wheat."
2050,"<price>49<rating>85<whiskey>Wyoming Single Barrel Bourbon (#1056), 44%<review>Wyoming Whiskey (Kirby, Wyo.) is making bourbon from Wyoming grain, on a column still, aged in full-sized barrels...in the Wyoming climate. Minty, grassy, meadow-varied plants; a bit of cedar and old clothes. Mouth is fuller, with more corn sweetness and balance than the small batch (see below). Notes of sweet citrus, rye punchiness, and that cedar flit by quickly in the mouth, and the finish is long and smooth. Much preferred over the small batch."
2051,"<price>165<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 22 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 1997 (product of Beldorney), 53%<review>Terrific nose of apple strudel, vanilla fudge, honey, raisins in syrup, and poached pears. A golden, honeyed dram, with fudge and a spike of ginger spice, followed by apple muffins, apple peelings, a touch of oak char, and a finish of sweet caramelized sugar. In case you are wondering, Beldorney is Duncan Taylor’s term for Wardhead, which is a blended malt of primarily Glenfiddich, with a small amount of Balvenie."
2052,"<price>124<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1987, 51.5%<review>Creamy vanilla, fresh-cut grass, gentle herbal notes, Murray mints, and the warm newsprint wrappers of fish and chips on the coast (in a lovely, comforting way). The cereals provide a sweet biscuit note, butterscotch candy, gingersnaps, and a nip of aniseed. The outturn of cask #10804, its taste develops with dried orange peel, cookie dough, and vanilla. Quite scrumptious! Fading slowly, it leaves behind gentle spices and syrup-drizzled popcorn. (198 bottles) £86"
2053,"<price>239<rating>91<whiskey>Finest Irish Whiskey 22 year old, 51.8%<review>Every so often, whether by blind luck or meticulous searching, a brilliant cask turns up. Fruit pastilles, peaches in syrup, caramelized apples, freshly baked bread, and lemons weeping juice, supported by the smoke from the glowing red fringes of burning newspaper. Lemon and grapefruit acidity in the mouth, developing creaminess, vanilla, and more tropical fruit characteristics, with some slightly bitter char surfacing after a minute. Candied grapefruit follows into the finish as the smoke rolls in. Rather glorious. (The Whisky Exchange only) £165"
2054,"<price>438<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park 1974 vintage 31 year old (Cask #8998), 45.4%<review>Antique gold, relatively light in color compared to the rest of the Highland Parks reviewed here. Nicely rounded on the nose and palate, and surprisingly youthful for such maturity. Mouth-coating texture. Quite fruity -- especially with some water -- with notes of honey-drenched citrus, sultana, key lime pie, and melon. Caramel and bitter chocolate notes emerge, with the chocolate and a wisp of smoke lingering on the finish. I could drink this all day and never tire of it. (Bottled for Virginia ABC)"
2055,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Bruichladdich Sherry Edition Oloroso 1998 vintage, 46%<review>Less appetizing brine and zing, and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. Sweeter notes of toffee, fig, and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts, black raspberry, plum, nectarine, and ripe red grape. A soothing dram."
2056,"<price>85<rating>87<whiskey>Hillrock Estate Solera Aged Bourbon (Barrel No. 146), 46.3%<review>Sweet notes of vanilla, hazelnut, and chocolate meet fragrant leathery oak on the nose, along with chocolate mint and French burnt peanuts candy. On the palate, this bourbon achieves a nice balance of stone fruit sweetness, lively spice, fresh spearmint, and drying oak that strikes a sandalwood note. A splash of water makes it sing."
2057,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Jim Beam Harvest Collection Six Row Barley, 45%<review>A toasty nose with bright citrus, spice, and oaky vanilla; you can feel the heat. Clearly Beam, but just as clearly different; there’s a flat spread to this, and a dry pull on the tongue and in the finish. Six-row barley has more husk to it, which can add tannins to beer; is there enough here to make a difference? It’s an interesting character, but it’s not all good. Price is per 375 ml."
2058,"<price>311<rating>88<whiskey>Celtic Cask Dó, 46%<review>Powerfully smoky, this one. Driftwood bonfires with a distinctive salinity to the smoke. Neglected fruit bowls. The tannins and red wine influences of cherry, apple, peach, and mango attempt to match the intensity of the burning engine of peat. Sooty embers diminish, leaving cherry-studded fudge to finish. Wonderful design touches inspired by the Book of Kells on this peated single malt from Cooley finished in red wine casks from Ànima Negra. (349 bottles) €250"
2059,"<price>23<rating>82<whiskey>Eagle Rare 10 year old, 45%<review>The label says 10 years old, but this tastes more like bourbon in its mid teens. A big bourbon, and quite the antithesis of the 80 Strong below. Sweet notes of maple syrup and toffee are quickly taken over by firm mint and dried fruits, which then yields to emerging notes of polished leather, roasted nuts, and dry resinous oak. Long, spicy dried finish with cinnamon, mint, and oak. For those who like their bourbon bold and with plenty of oak impact. (Bottled exclusively for Bayway World of Liquor.)"
2060,"<price>72<rating>82<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Octaves Peated, 44%<review>A relatively heavily-peated variant of Glenglassaugh matured in 50-liter octave casks, giving significant cask influence due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. This expression is non-chill filtered. Carbolic soap and a mineral note on the softly smoky nose, followed by apple pie and cream notes. The palate is medium-sweet and quite spicy, with black pepper. Now clear, dry peat notes present themselves with a touch of chili. Ashy peat and cinnamon in the medium-length finish. £55"
2061,"<price>72<rating>87<whiskey>Scapa Glansa, 40%<review>Glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish,” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill American oak casks. Madeira notes on the nose, with vanilla, honey, and pears. Richly fruity on the palate, with cocoa powder, vanilla, caramel, and mild wood smoke. Dark berries emerge from the background. The dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish, where smokiness increases."
2062,"<price>150<rating>97<whiskey>Parker's Heritage Collection, 'Golden Anniversary', 50%<review>This bottling celebrates master distiller Parker Beam's 50 years of service by including whiskey from each of the past five decades. This is a fabulous whiskey: seamless and incredibly complex, with an impeccable marriage of youth and maturity. It’s also very even-keeled throughout -- quite different than last year’s equally impressive PHC, a 27 year old, whose personality was more like an exhilarating old wooden rollercoaster ride (and also brandished more oak). Look for candied citrus, nectarine, blueberry, and sultana anchored by a nougat center, laced with honeyed vanilla and orange creamsicle. There’s a dusting of cocoa powder, brittle mint, and cinnamon, too. Tobacco leaves, polished leather, and teasing bourbon barrel char round out the palate, emerging more prominently towards a warming finish. A classic!"
2063,"<price>62<rating>80<whiskey>Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #264), 40%<review>When introducing new world whisky, I tell folks to treat it not as a scotch but as a totally different whisky. But how far can you go? The French have a “whisky” made with buckwheat — technically not a grain — and chestnuts. Now we have this. This is light, sweet, with flavored candy and fruit jelly; lots of pruney, grapey Cognac notes. There's the issue. Is it a nice drink? Yes. Is it really a whisky? It's up for debate."
2064,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof Rye (Batch 3), 61%<review>6 year old MGP rye at full Booker’s-style unfiltered proof. Strong barrel/warehouse reek, some pepper, and a hint of dill. Shock: drinkable at 61%. Rich barrel flavors: oak, light maple, and custardy vanilla, albeit quite hot. Mint and pepper zip around the mouth; now on the tongue, now on the roof, racing down the throat, a big, active whiskey. Finish bubbles on with pepper and prickle, daring you to stick in a quarter and ride it again. An experience."
2065,"<price>63<rating>87<whiskey>Kilchoman, Winter 2010 Release, 46%<review>Aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. The new bourbon casks are evident, and I think it adds richness, vibrancy, and perceived maturity (which I like) when compared to the previous Summer 2010 release. Very pale in color. Brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky, briny finish. I’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. Well done! "
2066,"<price>180<rating>84<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at Glenury Royal), Cask #3049, 20 year old, 1984 vintage, 43.5%<review>Thick and very tactile. Malty, with good heft. Notes of vanilla, honey, biscuit, and caramel custard. A soothing, comforting whisky. On the surface, not very complex, but very satisfying nonetheless. 
"
2067,"<price>2000<rating>77<whiskey>Auchentoshan 41 year old 1962 Vintage, 40.3%<review>This whisky comes from two bourbon casks, producing only 112 bottles. I believe it’s the most expensive Lowland whisky on the market. Unfortunately, its flavor doesn’t stand up to its price. While I applaud Morrison Bowmore's efforts to give us the opportunity to try such a mature expression of Auchentoshan, I feel that the whisky is past its prime. I wouldn't describe it as overly woody, like I have other whiskies that are 41 years old. Rather, I would describe it as overly funky. The whisky's aroma and flavor are very peculiar, with plenty of vegetal notes (cucumbers especially) combined with stewed fruit, golden raisins, rose petals, and spice (anise, clove). If it were $100 a bottle, I would suggest that you gather a few friends to chip in and buy a bottle, just for the experience. But at $2,000, I think we should leave this one for the collectors."
2068,"<price>123<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Craigellachie) 18 year old, 48.4%<review>Amber. A thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. Has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily, jasmine) typical of mature Craig, alongside toffee. The palate is ripe, juicy, and full, the cask adding a slight resinous edge. Appears slightly smoky. Becomes fleshy, even waxy, with water, and decidedly more elegant. The tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. It is at its best neat, or with water on the side. £80"
2069,"<price>56<rating>87<whiskey>Penderyn Portwood 41, 41%<review>A distillery-only bottling last year, and I'm delighted it's now more widely available. Penderyn is as brash about portwood as the Aussies, and this has a rich, creamy, and sweet liqueur-like taste, with blackcurrant to the fore. It's a delight. Penderyn is bottled in batches, so this is a different version from last year’s, but it's close. I called it fruit compote in a glass. £36"
2070,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Cuatro Series Manzanilla, 46%<review>Initially drier on the nose than the Fino expression, then caramel appears, along with milk chocolate and vanilla. More pronounced leathery notes than the Fino; fuller bodied and fruitier on the palate, with the fruit developing a salty tang. Lingering salty fruit and spices in the finish, with final dark chocolate."
2071,"<price>101<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Clynelish) 1996, 46%<review>A 1996 expression is the latest Clynelish to take its place in the Connoisseurs’ Choice lineup. Maturation occurred in refill sherry butts. Fruity on the nose, with ripe bananas, malt, dark toffee, lemongrass, and a splash of brine. Ultimately, a green, herbal note. Relatively full-bodied, creamy and slightly waxy on the palate; spicy sherry, Golden Delicious apples, and old leather. The finish is medium to long, with lingering ginger. £60"
2072,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Eifel German Rye, 46%<review>A dark amber dram made from 90% rye yields a nose of chestnuts, mushroom consommé, earthiness, nutmeg, and clove. Dark berries dominate, with bramble, crème de cassis, black cherry, plum, and mixed peel, then chocolate, cinnamon, and nutmeg—a great autumnal dram after an invigorating walk in the countryside. Unique and confident whisky with an inky blue-fruit finish matched with dry and gentle spiciness. (3,000 bottles)"

Delicate, sweet, and floral on the nose, with old leather, caramel, vanilla, and malt. The caramel deepens with time. The palate is initially sweet, smooth, and malty, with pear drops; becoming nuttier, with soft oak in the medium-length finish. £370 Currently not available in the U.S."
2074,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (2014 release) 12 year old, 48.5%<review>This whiskey’s signature over the last several years has been wood dominant, with plenty of dried spice (the exception being the 2013 release which I really enjoyed—it was chock full of balancing sweetness). The 2014 release is similar to the pre-2013 releases, with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla) and dried citrus on a soft bed of maple syrup, caramel, and honey, leading to resinous oak grip on the finish. A dynamic bourbon, but still leaning heavily on the oak spice."

Has a small-barrel smell to it—a dry wood and hard candy note I’m starting to recognize—and a snap of rye. Interesting: light but not weak in the mouth. I found their moonshine not that clean, but the wood’s done a good job on it. Rye grass and sweet corn mingle with pepper and anise. Clean finish. (Montana only)"
2076,"<price>724<rating>84<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1983 (Cask #31), 46.1%<review>In style, this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. Here, though, there is added key lime pie, juicy white peaches, and whipped cream alongside that deep Glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. The medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. The most freshly acidic of the selection, with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430"
2077,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Fitch’s Goat Moonshine, 43.5%<review>Crystal clear and colorless. Somewhat rich for unaged corn spirit: corn, baked apple, grass, and a very light honeysuckle syrup. Quite mellow on the tongue; sweet, but with a drying finish of baked grain, sweet dried grass, and finally, just a hint of heat high in the mouth. A pleasant little glass."
2078,"<price>28<rating>88<whiskey>Rittenhouse Rye Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Barely legal at 51% rye, Rittenhouse packs lots of corn, offering a different profile than those higher-rye whiskeys from Indiana. Straight from the glass burst caramel, campfire smoke, and vanilla, with hints of dill weed and Herbs de Provence. Ripe in flavor, it shows slight mint from the rye and a complex voyage of herbs with a touch of chocolate here and walnut shell there. There’s a reason bartenders love mixing with this; it’s good neat or on the rocks."
2079,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Templeton Rye Special Reserve 10 year old, 50.5%<review>Spicy and pleasantly sweet. Vibrant too, with cinnamon, peppermint stick, and caramel corn. Warming spice zing on the finish. Quite possibly at its peak age for flavor, maturity, and balance."
2080,"<price>34<rating>82<whiskey>Wigle Triple Double, 46%<review>Part of this Pittsburgh distillery’s series of “Whims” one-offs. Truly interesting nose: a combination of new-barrel bourbon reek and Irish raw barley grassiness, yielding mint, vanilla, juicy wet grain, and faint cinnamon. Hot entry of vanilla and small-barrel oak, which suddenly collapses to a dry cocoa sweetness spiked with hot pepper, like Mexican chocolate. This typifies a lot of craft efforts: not a great whiskey now, but one with terrifically interesting potential. I hope Wigle pursues this Whim. Price is per 375 ml."
2081,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>The only setback from last year’s Antique Collection release, when I rated it an 84 because it was showing too much wood (especially compared to the 2007-2008 releases). The 2010 release is back on track, with great balance, and showing very traditional notes of vanilla toffee, rummy molasses, dusty corn, soft summer fruit, and a sprinkling of spice (cinnamon, mint, cocoa), with oak resin to balance out the sweet notes. (Editor's Choice)"
2082,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 14 year old, 46%<review>Perfect for drinkers with a Goldilocks complex, this falls between the lemon-favoring 12 year old, and the richer, sherry finished 16 year old, with a nose of sweet mandarin, tropical fruits, fruit pastries, warm banana muffin, barley sugar, and forest honey. Bold, attention-grabbing flavors of orange, honey, vanilla, dried ginger, pepper, and jam-slathered pastries, with caramel, ground almond, and a tantalizing, zesty grapefruit bitterness toward the end."
2083,"<price>440<rating>83<whiskey>Highland Park 31 year old 1974 vintage (Cask #8998), 45.4%<review>Pleasant aroma (subtle, but with nice depth), with notes of honeyed lime, kiwi, chopped nuts, chocolate fudge, and gentle, seasoned tobacco. Everything is working nicely on the palate too, with a similar flavor profile (the nuts now being roasted) and some smoldering smoke, until about mid-palate, when its age becomes evident with some wet wood notes blending in the mix through to the finish. (Exclusive to Virginia ABC.)"
2084,"<price>150<rating>80<whiskey>Inchmurrin 18 year old, 46%<review>Rich on the nose, with damp tweed, malt, and a suggestion of earthiness. Finally, salted butter. The palate offers muted tropical fruits, soft gingery oak, and more earthiness. In the finish, the oak becomes more overt without dominating."
2085,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Treaty Oak Red Handed, 47.5%<review>Fresh oak on the nose, floral notes, baked apple, bananas, and chocolate malt. The palate is light and slightly green, with herbal parsley notes, lime, and lemon, then expanding to vanilla, bitter chocolate, peanut shells, pepper, and tobacco. The finish is chocolaty, with more notes of peanut, as well as orange peel, herbaceousness, and peppery heat."
2086,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Fusion Series #1 Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 49.45%<review>This is Bardstown Bourbon’s first release using its own whiskey—60% 2 year old bourbon, along with 40% 11 year old from another Kentucky distillery. The nose is herbal, with a rush of peppermint, along with caramel-swirl ice cream, peanuts in the shell, and root beer. In the mouth, it’s dense with cooked dark fruit, cola, chocolate, nuts, and well-integrated spice (nutmeg, white pepper, allspice). More dark fruit, spice, dark chocolate, espresso, and oak on the lush finish."
2087,"<price>124<rating>88<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. 18 year old, 41.3%<review>After 18 years maturing in traditional oak, this triple distilled whiskey undergoes a four-cask finish in bourbon, oloroso sherry, port, and madeira casks. Following a 6 month period of finishing, molasses, raisins, chocolate ganache, malt loaf, and solid oak notes have emerged after careful blending of the component whiskeys. Smooth, yet thick and mouth-drawing; black fruits, treacle, wrinkled vanilla pods, chocolate chip muffins, and sticky dates. There are less than 2,500 bottles of this attractive, resinous whiskey that slips away leaving sweetness, dark fruit, and cinnamon. €110"
2088,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>10th Street American Single Malt, 46%<review>Most American single malts aren’t aiming to recreate the flavors of scotch, but this well-balanced whiskey made in San Jose could easily blend into an Islay lineup. Briny, with rubbery, mineral peat on the nose, along with lemon peel, Asian pear, red apple, grilled pineapple, and beach bonfire. The palate is sweet and savory, with salty peat, burnt ends, charred nuts, tobacco, lemon peel, and black pepper. It finishes nutty, with tobacco, espresso, pepper, and lingering smoke."
2089,"<price>53<rating>89<whiskey>Cutty Sark Cask Strength, 51.4%<review>Blended whiskies have taken a sexy turn for the better, and there have been some excellent attempts to innovate. Indeed, a gap has opened up between main label blends and this sort of thing, which is particularly brave because a world-class brand has let amateurs loose on it. That said, this is massive, with big earthy spice, peat, and sour fruits. There's some youthful sappiness in the mix, too, but it's not detrimental. Brave and impressive.  "
2090,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight Whiskey (Batch 1), 50%<review>This whiskey shows some green-spirit youth, but it’s headed in a good direction, with sassafras, toasted nuts, leather, forest aromas, and a touch of furniture polish. It’s much bigger on the palate, as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices, and treacle. The wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable, but plenty to like. (2,580 bottles)"
2091,"<price>25<rating>89<whiskey>Maker’s Mark, 45%<review>The original Maker’s Mark, tried and true, and the same since the 1950s. The nose is consistent with a flare on the floral, toffee and caramel, roasted almonds, and loads of vanilla. Just when you think you’ve tasted this a million times, it offers candied fruit and pie crust with the final touches of praline and a hint of pecan shell."
2092,"<price>400<rating>87<whiskey>Tomatin, 30 year old, 1976 vintage, 49.3%<review>Bold and spicy, but with enough backbone to handle it. Surely the most intense of the bunch overall. (The 25 year old is dry on the palate -- especially on the finish -- but the 30 year old challenges you the throughout.) There’s plenty of oak here, imparting leather, resin, and dried spice notes (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), but it is rescued by sherried fruit, honeyed citrus, and toffee. A powerful dram."
2093,"<price>350<rating>93<whiskey>Glenlivet XXV 25 year old, 43%<review>Finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. My feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. In this instance, I feel it has, and more. It’s not as nimble as younger versions, but the sherry, along with the extra aging, contributes a silky texture and a richer, fuller dimension to the whisky. I can still detect some of the peach, vanilla, tropical fruit, and honeyed malt I enjoy in younger expressions, but its key flavor components are toffee, honey-dipped citrus, red licorice, chocolate-covered almonds, and fig, along with dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. The flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced."
2094,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Bowmore Voyage, 56%<review>Copper color with shades of ruby. Intriguing aromas of sweet plum, grapes, citrus, peat smoke, seaweed, and brine. Full-bodied and somewhat viscous. Flavors of ripe fruit (plums, grapes, citrus), followed by a burst of more traditional Bowmore flavors (peat smoke, brine, seaweed), finishing with lingering notes of prunes, dates, baker’s chocolate, and licorice.

While there is no age statement, this whisky was aged for 12 years in bourbon barrels, followed by an additional 18 months in ruby port casks. I believe it is the first distillery bottling to marry port with the traditional flavors of an Islay whisky. Because of this, it is best to keep an open mind when trying this whisky, perhaps even having more than one go at it before rendering a verdict. I suspect the more you try Voyage, the more you will like."
2095,"<price>220<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin 30 year old, 46%<review>Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell, currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins. "
2096,"<price>115<rating>88<whiskey>Hunter Laing Old Malt Cask 1996 (distilled at Arran), 50%<review>This expression was distilled during Arran’s second year of operation in September 1996 and bottled at 19 years of age. The single refill hogshead yielded 288 bottles. Sweet and malty on the slick nose, with honey, lively spices, and hints of pine. Ultimately, caramel and satsuma. Full on the palate, with juicy fruit, more malt and honey, and developing milk chocolate. Long and soft in the finish; lightly spiced, finally slightly citric, with a hint of brine and dry oak. £80"
2097,"<price>49<rating>88<whiskey>Double Barrel Ledaig/Bowmore, 46%<review>The question with this sort of blended malt is whether the whole outperforms the sum of its parts. This is a big, rich, oily, and peaty whisky, suggesting both the Ledaig—the peated version of Tobermory and often a bland malt—and the Bowmore—capable of big smoke notes when it wants to—are firing on all cylinders. There's not much subtlety to it, but it's enjoyable all the same.€40"
2098,"<price>39<rating>91<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Red Label Blend (tweaked), 43%<review>The feedback loop is short when the guys who make the whisky also pour it for consumers. This “tweaked” version of Red Label blends home-distilled corn, rye, and single malt whiskies with a sourced base. Tweaking the proportions yields a brighter, bolder, and crisper whisky than the original, with soaring esters, fragrant flowers, succulent vanillas, and brisk spices."
2099,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates Captain Lawrence Brewing Co. Edition, 40%<review>Spicier and funkier than other Caskmates, this is where Irish whiskey meets Scott Vaccaro’s brews from the Lower Hudson Valley. This is self-assured with dark ale aromas, cinnamon bark, grapefruit, bitter lemon, and some savory notes. The pot still spices work overtime, complementing the dark honey, apple, and creamy beer notes. It feels a little out of focus, with pulses of flavor rather than a smooth development."
2100,"<price>62<rating>83<whiskey>Arran Machrie Moor 5th Edition, 46%<review>Arran distillery has been making peated batches of spirit since 2004, and this NAS bottling is the fifth release of that spirit, peated to 20 ppm. The outturn is 12,000 bottles. Nutty peat, spicy malt, toffee, and lemon on the mildly savory nose. Vibrant on the palate, with lots of citrus fruit. A bonfire smokiness develops steadily, with spice, nuts, and plain chocolate through to the relatively long finish, which features a persistent citric note."
2101,"<price>199<rating>96<whiskey>Canadian Club 40 year old, 45%<review>After 40 years in barrels, the trademark Canadian Club dark fruit is as rich as ever. Reminiscent of raisin tarts with sprinkles of sweet baking spices, then strawberries and black pepper. Warming but never hot. No tannins, no woodiness; silky barrel tones are the only hint of oak, while soaring floral esters speak loudly of time in the barrel. The glowing, never-ending finish is spectacular. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$250

2102,"<price>235<rating>88<whiskey>Octomore 10.4, 63.5%<review>The youngest Octomore released to date, 10.4 was distilled from Scottish barley peated to 88 ppm, then aged for 3 years in 28 highly toasted virgin Limousin French oak casks. The nose offers vanilla, new leather, cloves, sawdust, and white pepper. Intense fruitiness on the palate, with malt, a medicinal note, and more cloves. The finish yields dried fruits, bitter oak, and hot spices. (12,000 bottles)"
2103,"<price>131<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Banquet of Fruits 1994 (distilled at Aberfeldy), 46%<review>Distilled in 1994 and matured in a single hogshead, this 21 year old expression is part of Wemyss Malts’ 2016 Midsummer Single Cask Release. Rich, stewed fruits, honey, and allspice on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous on the palate with spicy apple and cranberry. The finish dries quite rapidly to aniseed and spicy oak. (220 bottles) £100"
2104,"<price>304<rating>93<whiskey>Mortlach 18 year old, 43.4%<review>Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry, this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite, bitter chocolate, and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie, and rowan berries. Deep, but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which, in comparison, seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml"
2105,"<price>302<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Queen 1561 30 year old, 40%<review>A limited edition blend with more than 75 percent malt content, containing grains from 1978 and 1979, and malts from 1982. A genteel nose exudes white chocolate, vanilla slice, butterscotch, fresh apricots, and salted pecans. Commanding and rich, it luxuriates in bitter orange, ripe apricots, marmalade, dairy toffees, cinnamon, and raspberry, with a finish of Seville orange rind. It’s a little blander with water, toward baked lemons and barley sugar, so resist and take it as it comes. £190"
2106,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Big Level Wheated Bourbon, 50%<review>The name should give some indication: this is a big, brawny whiskey. Aromas of orange peel, iced tea, toasted coconut, peanut, honey, and molasses spar with grain and dry firewood. The palate delivers oak, more grain, orange oil, menthol, roasted nuts, iced tea, cherries, and cola. Tobacco, leathery oak, and bitter chocolate tie everything together on the finish, which is especially enjoyable with a few drops of water added."
2107,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>High West American Prairie Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 19A23), 46%<review>Minty and herbal on the nose, with notes of fresh oak, licorice, apricots, brown sugar, dried apples, orange peel, peaches, light coconut, ginger, and dried leaves. The palate is sweet up front, with a complex melding of butterscotch, spicy oak, orange slices, and chocolate fudge. The finish offers lots of spice, black pepper, bitter chocolate, and a pleasant note of almond nuttiness. A well-textured whiskey, with lots of spice and heat."
2108,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Dry Fly Cask Strength Wheat, 60%<review>Not burning my nose; mild bread and vanilla aromas. Peppy stuff, but not explosive on the palate; easily held five seconds on the tongue, but fiery once it gets aerated. Sweet grain with a big saw-toothed edge of cinnamon and hot vanilla, and a circling brim of zingy mint that tightens toward the finish. Pretty interesting stuff for wheat whiskey; a more expressive nose would seal the deal. Price is per 375ml."
2109,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Company Fusion Series #1, 49.45%<review>Contract distiller Bardstown Bourbon has begun building its own portfolio of whiskeys, and this inaugural release—comprising 60% Bardstown’s own 2 year old bourbon and 40% sourced 11 year old bourbon—is an auspicious debut. Rye and an herbal rush of peppermint and dill greet the nose, swathed in cotton candy, vanilla cream, and nutty caramel. The palate is loaded with chocolate fudge, honeyed almonds, dark fruits, light pepper, and allspice. Bitter chocolate, espresso, orange peel, leather, and spice complete a sumptuous finish. Number 11 in the 2019 Top 20 "
2110,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Single Malt (Cask 52), 46%<review>Aromas of halva, dry hay, poached pears, and apple pie. The palate is sweet and full, with ripe cherries and a certain earthiness along with dusty grain and aromatic wet hay. Peppery heat enhances hot ginger and cinnamon hearts. This is malt whisky, held together by strong cereal notes with a fruity, creamy, medium finish. It’s already tasty at 3 years; one wonders what glories another 3 would bring."
2111,"<price>140<rating>89<whiskey>Scotch Malt Whisky Society (28:23) 21 year old, 57.5%<review>This bottling of Tullibardine was distilled in November 1989 and has been matured in a refill sherry butt. The U.S. allocation is 120 bottles. Initially, damp earth on the nose, sweetening to milk chocolate-covered fudge and vanilla, along with hazelnuts. Notes of plum and black pepper with time. The palate is fruity, with toffee, spice, and cedar wood notes. Long in the finish, with cereal and spicy resin. "
2112,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Hudson Do The Rye Thing New York Straight, 46%<review>
Made from a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley, and aged at least 3 years. The nose is freshly sweet, with notes of orange tea, orange peel, nectarine, licorice, dark chocolate, leather, and dried flowers. A creamy palate offers marmalade, fruitcake, baking spice, and barrel char. The finish is light but lengthy, with bursts of dark fruit tart, black currant, and vanilla bean. Excellent complexity for a whiskey this young."
2113,"<price>549<rating>87<whiskey>The Macallan Diamond Jubilee, 52%<review>A vatting of sherry casks from (apparently) royally significant dates with an outturn of 2012 (get it?) bottles. Auburn in color, it has a fruit compote nose mixed with citrus, and a little hint of gravy browning in the background. This mix of the exotic—oil of clove on the tongue, the sweet and light grip—makes for a very intriguing, concentrated, and layered palate. Think of Turkish Delight and crystallized ginger. Try the distillery shop for stock. £350"
2114,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 59.8%<review>This unpeated version of Caol Ila was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is quite reticent, with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes. Big, fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate, with caramel, rock pools, hot spices, plain chocolate, and very mild wood smoke. Bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish."
2115,"<price>76<rating>84<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British) Batch 1, 51.1%<review>Custard creams, lemon peel, and clotted cream create easygoing aromas on this drop from the mighty Edinburgh grain distillery. The palate moves rapidly through flavors of lemon cake and lime zest, to grapefruit sharpness and fresh pineapple, reaching a plateau of sherbet and tangerine. Like a bulldog chewing a wasp, there’s lip-puckering sharpness throughout, though it’s judiciously dosed with sufficient sweetness to counterbalance it. A great introduction to the delights of the single grain category. (117 bottles) £48"
2116,"<price>18<rating>82<whiskey>Shieldaig Classic, 40%<review>In blended whisky terms, this isn’t for the faint-hearted, and joins a number of recent releases prepared to show off its
darker, grittier side. It’s a big flavored blend, with its heart in the islands, and with oily coastal notes reminiscent of a delicatessen: brine, salty cheese, some crab apple relish, and smoked fish. It’s a rugged bruiser, but it makes its mark with some style."
2117,"<price>600<rating>92<whiskey>Talisker 1985, 56.1%<review>This 27 year old Talisker has been aged in refill American oak casks, and the nose offers brine, wood smoke, wet tarry rope, slightly medicinal, with the emergence of milk chocolate. Big-bodied, with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon, with sweeter notes of malt, fudge, and apple. A hint of fabric Elastoplast. Long in the finish, with rock pools, bonfire ash, and sweet, tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. A powerful beast, even by Talisker standards. (3,000 bottles)."
2118,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades, 52%<review>Wild Turkey often exhibits a delightful earthiness, and when earth meets sweet in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades achieves a rich texture where deep-tilled soil, fresh-cut grass, and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate, followed by dill, oregano, and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. Master distiller Eddie Russell mingled barrels ranging from 10 to 20 years old in order to strike this balance and complexity. His method displays the potential of combining extremely old stocks into batches with younger barrels to build a great whiskey. Number 3 in the 2017 Top 20

2119,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Firestone & Robertson Founder’s Select Troy’s Pick TX Single Barrel Texas Straight Bourbon (No. 1412), 45%<review>One of two single barrel bourbons distilled in 2015, this one selected by Firestone & Robertson co-founder Troy Robertson. The nose is somewhat green, but offers notes of iced tea, candied orange, graham crackers, and antique closet. The palate has flavors of dark chocolate, tea leaves, roasted nuts, mint, wild herbs, and barrel char. The finish is barrel-forward, with more char, drying tobacco, and roasted coffee beans."
2120,"<price>400<rating>95<whiskey>Brora, 30 year old (2009 Release), 53.2%<review>This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth, complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak, one-dimensional). Very clean, but oily in texture, with honeyed vanilla, caramel, citrus (tangerine, orange, lemon), nectarine, olive brine, black pepper, ginger, cut grass, mustard seed, and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny, spicy finish. Wonderful!"
2121,"<price>145<rating>92<whiskey>Writers’ Tears Cask Strength 2018, 53%<review>A stunning effort, with honey, sunflower seeds, zested orange, toasted flapjacks, nectarine, kiwi, and lime, with the citrus opening up with water. Superb to see a delicious, drinkable cask-strength whiskey showing off its flavors this well: honey, citrus, sweet toffee, vanilla pod, and a spice blast of pepper before a soft, flowing fruitiness is enveloped by ground ginger. Clove, peppercorn, and fresh ginger make for an epic finish. (5,175 bottles)"
2122,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Aberfeldy 16 year old Single Cask (Cask No. 5), 57.4%<review>From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity, with notes of golden raisin, pineapple, nectarine, and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel. A dusting of vanilla, cinnamon, and hint of cocoa, with black licorice on the finish. Lush and mouth-coating. The best of the Aberfeldy whiskies I’ve tasted to date. (New Hampshire only)"
2123,"<price>54<rating>90<whiskey>Kirkland 18 year old Sherry Cask Finish Speyside, 46%<review>Another Kirkland with evident sherry: raisins, figs, sugared almonds, leather, and pistachio-studded chocolate show up in full force, along with a note of rancio indicating its age. Additional flavors of nougat, orange oil, candied violets, and ginger swish into a full, rounded finish that settles in for a lengthy stay. This comes from the same undisclosed distillery as Kirkland’s 20 year old. (Costco)"
2124,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Oloroso Sherry Cask Finished, 50%<review>The confectionary nose of flan and crème caramel comes draped over lovely grainy aromas of warm porridge and pastry crust. Vinous notes of cherry/berry fruit emerge, along with toasted almonds and floral aromas. On the palate, there is berry coulis, Creamsicle stick, French burnt peanut candies, and warm banana. Overall, this demonstrates both nice maturity and lovely balance of sweetness and spice, with a finish of cinnamon-sprinkled apple pie."
2125,"<price>989<rating>93<whiskey>Caol Ila 35 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2018), 58.1%<review>A rare veteran bottling from Caol Ila, and the oldest of the 2018 Special Releases, this was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill European oak butts. The nose is fragrant and inviting, with dried fruit, ginger, and beach bonfire. Vibrant tropical fruit on the palate, with cinnamon and developing brine-sodden peat. Bold fruit flavors along with white pepper and soft peat remain in the lengthy finish. (3,276 bottles) Collectible"
2126,"<price>54<rating>88<whiskey>Benriach The Original Ten, 43%<review>
This unpeated single malt updates and replaces the previous 10 year old. It presents tropical fruits, vanilla, honey, and ginger on the nose. Soft fruits, malt, and milk chocolate inhabit the creamy, well-balanced palate. Hazelnuts, drinking chocolate, and light spices surface in the medium-length finish, with just a wisp of smoke."
2127,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Dewar’s White Label Scratched Cask, 40%<review>What lies beneath the surface of Dewar’s? Here, the blend is finished in virgin and first-fill bourbon casks especially charred, then scratched to enable deeper penetration. Thick wedge of vanilla and fudge with oaky accents, a dusty mouthfeel pulling in vanilla, light lemon, milk chocolate, and sweet toffee, ending on a cocoa powder note. Compared with regular White Label, this is less obviously sweet and creamy, adds complexity, and opens a bourbon connection. Certainly, this is up to scratch."
2128,"<price>86<rating>89<whiskey>BenRiach Cask Strength (Batch 1), 57.2%<review>Remember those remarkable 20+ year old BenRiachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? Think again. This new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose, followed by mango, orange blossom honey, and Portuguese custard tarts. It needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. A sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. Marked within its competitive set. £60"
2129,"<price>53<rating>89<whiskey>Boone County Distilling Eighteen 33 10 year old, 45.4%<review>First it’s oak and leather, then spices of a different sort dominate, such as anise, fennel, and caraway. Then, the usual suspects in a bourbon of this age: caramel, vanilla, leather, oak, nutmeg, and slight hints of off-the-beaten-path notes: black pepper and sage. After a lovely medium-to-long finish with a strong note of toasted pecan, this is, for sure, a good, though not great sipping whiskey."
2130,"<price>110<rating>88<whiskey>GlenAllachie 15 year old, 46%<review>A period of finishing in a combination of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry puncheons and hogsheads distinguishes this release. The nose is fragrant, with spicy red wine, raspberries, ginger, milk chocolate, and nutmeg. Viscous on the palate, with lots of cloves, plus vanilla, raisins, and instant coffee with a slug of sherry in it. Dark chocolate, licorice, and black coffee feature in the finish. Overall, nicely balanced."
2131,"<price>56<rating>81<whiskey>Highland Queen 8 year old, 40%<review>At 8 years old, there are stiff caramels, malt, oatcakes, Genoise sponge, and zested clementines on the nose. It doesn’t stint on flavor when it comes to the taste, bringing dried fig rolls, chewy toffee, Aunt Sally pralines, walnuts, and chocolate ganache to the party. It’s driven by dry fruit rather than sweetness, and there is a bitter edge to the swallow that persists into the finish. £35"
2132,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Blackened American Whiskey (Batch 097), 45%<review>A blend of straight whiskeys that’s finished in brandy casks using proprietary “sonic enhancement.” Sweet vanilla, lemon cream pie, spiced apricots, ginger, cracked corn, and licorice start off the nose, balanced against a soft influence of new oak. The palate is sweet and well-textured, with notes of spice, candied apple, cooked plums, chocolate nuttiness, and a fair amount of barrel influence. There’s some good length on the finish, which offers sweet flavors of light chocolate, along with lingering spice and layered oak."
2133,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig 10 year old, 40%<review>This expression offers an uncompromising note of brine-laden peat and iodine, with charcoal and sweeter fruit notes also present. The palate is equally out there, with old-fashioned fabric Band-Aids, bladderwrack seaweed, black pepper, smoldering peat, vanilla, caramel, and sweet oak. The finish is as big as everything else, with barbecue, iodine, and asphalt. Still a classic!"
2134,"<price>299<rating>92<whiskey>Glendalough 17 year old Mizunara Cask-Finished, 46%<review>Beginning with more mature whiskey than Glendalough’s Japanese oak-finished debut, which was 13 years old, this has all the aromatic hallmarks of mizunara, as well as golden pastry, cooked peach, heather honey, light malt, baguette, and white pepper. A honeyed dram of melon, white grape, and clementine peel, with sparkling spices of black pepper and ginger root. It concludes with notes of gingerbread through to a spicy finish, though the sweetness remains a constant. (3,000 bottles for U.S.)"
2135,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Four Grain, 50%<review>This whiskey’s mashbill includes both rye and wheat. (Most bourbons contain one or the other, and usually it’s rye.) The sweet, inviting mellowness of the wheat is there; so is the spicy zing of the rye. Look for creamy caramel and soft vanilla peppered with fresh mint and warming cinnamon. Firm oak grip on the finish, with lingering spice. Dynamic and invigorating."
2136,"<price>44<rating>77<whiskey>Wild Weasel Finest Blend, 40%<review>They blended Wild Weasel single malt with whisky from the Radermacher distillery (maker of Lambertus grain whisky) to create the world’s first blended Belgian whisky. It noses young, with straw, digestive biscuits, damp woodlands, oat breakfast cereals, and a hint of spice saving it from nosing like a crisp Sauvignon Blanc. The mouthfeel is languorous, with a musty texture, some grapefruit acidity, tangerine sweetness, and a mild, malty finish. So now we know. €40"
2137,"<price>124<rating>82<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Longmorn) 20 year old 1992, 55.1%<review>With Longmorn, you are always looking for a dense, sweet fruitiness. This doesn’t disappoint on the nose, where there’s moist compacted fruitcake with marzipan, Brazil nut, glacé cherry, a hint of tobacco, then hard toffee. The palate is soft to start but then an overly firm grip and slightly bitter edges come through. Though water improves it, the oak is slightly too dominant. That said, the nose is superb. £80 "
2138,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>“Double Malt” Speyside (Second Edition), 46%<review>This “double malt” contains 70% 12 year old Dufftown (finished in a Zinfandel cask) and 30% 15 year old Mortlach (finished in a Callejo cask). This is a rich, fruity, gripping, broad-shouldered Speyside whisky. Richly sherried, with thick, layered sweetness as a foundation (honey, caramel, light toffee), along with ripe bramble, golden raisin, and pit fruit. Leather, tobacco-tinged, oak tannin finish."
2139,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon, 46%<review>Oak-driven and tightly wound, with herbal licorice, beeswax, and dried peaches. There is a real outdoorsy quality here of forest floor, autumn leaves, and cut grass. But it feels somewhat tired and weary on the palate, then falls apart with the addition of water. Grab the older bottling (50% ABV). This release has dropped in both proof and quality."
2140,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Rye (Cask 49), 46%<review>Rye flour, powerful rye spices—hot, sweet, and flavorful—bathed in flaxseed oil. Fragrant hints of breakfast tea blend with ripe dark fruit, peaches, and rich lilac perfume. Sweet and sour, and quite peppery, with a long finish. Made with nothing but rye grain, yet there is a certain slippery quality more commonly found in corn whisky. This is Still Waters distillery at its best."
2141,"<price>398<rating>90<whiskey>Yamazaki Mizunara, 48%<review>Mizunara—or Japanese oak—was considered inferior for many years. Only recently have its extraordinary aromatic qualities been appreciated. These are immediately apparent on the nose: aloes, wood incense, sandalwood, cinnamon balls, sour cherry, and apple, becoming more gingery with water. Intense and acidic in the mouth, there are tart, stewed red fruits, pomegranate, and citrus. Lightly bitter tannins add to the complexity, as does the smoke rising from the smoldering incense stick. The most significant Japanese whisky of the year?  £250"
2142,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Sortilège Prestige 7 years old, 40.9%<review>A rye-fueled, horse-drawn sleigh ride to a backwoods Quebec sugar shack springs instantly to mind. Vanilla, toasted wood, brittle maple snow taffy, and the woody, crystalline granularity of maple sugar in a velvety smooth whisky base. Hot pepper, wood smoke, and green maple bark fold into a steaming cauldron of whisky barrel notes. The first few days’ maple syrup is the richest and that alone is what blender Michel Marcil uses for this ultra-premium maple whisky. (Quebec only (dang!)) C$50"
2143,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old bourbon from floor #5, 45%<review>Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Similar sweet notes as its sibling aged in floor #1 (caramel, honey, ripe fruit), but with an additional layer of dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, clove) to accompany it. It has all the components of a fine bourbon, and it’s also nicely balanced, with good oak grip on the finish. The best of the three. Price is per 375 ml"
2144,"<price>48<rating>89<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s Union 52, 45%<review>The nose is focused on cereal, hints of fresh ripe cherries, cooked fruit salad, herbs, and overt, bourbon-like charcoal. Take a sip though, and big, beautiful tones of real peat reek rush to the fore on the palate. These are sustained by sweet barley sugar, candied fruit, dry cereal, and a lush mouthfeel. The smoke, incidentally, comes from a few drops of real scotch added at blending. Very moreish. (British Columbia exclusive) $65 CAD"
2145,"<price>300<rating>95<whiskey>Dun Bheagan (distilled at Springbank) Cask No. 1704 35 year old 1970 vintage, 50.5%<review>Quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky, but not too surprising for a Springbank. Notes of creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, coconut custard, brine, and a hint of anise. Complex, vibrant, and well-balanced. Reminds me why I love those old Springers. Devotees will not be disappointed. A stunning whisky! (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)"
2146,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>StoneHammer Distiller’s Reserve, 45%<review>Think cherries—they dominate the nose over earth, oak, and blueberries. Then it’s leather, tobacco, cigar box, and burnt pie crust edges. Finally, two notes become one, as cherry pie, with hints of rhubarb and cola. It sets itself up to be a prime whiskey, but the notes just fall off on a short finish. If only the backbone held up, this could be remarkable stuff."
2147,"<price>35<rating>76<whiskey>Virgil Kaine High Rye Bourbon, 45%<review>Wood tannins are an interesting thing; used correctly, they can help create spice, depth, and complexity, as well as define a spirit's character. Unrestrained, tannins can wreak havoc. That’s what’s happened with this whiskey. Sharp, unfinished wood defines a nose that is raw in every sense. A thin entry struggles to present maple and caramel before a heavy blast of oak tannins decimates them. Those tannins define the rest of the taste experience, including a sour and bitter finish."
2148,"<price>29<rating>85<whiskey>Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish Highland, 40%<review>A delicate grassy nose with aromas of bread dough, green bananas, cardamom, and lemon. Light-bodied on the palate, with pleasant flavors of cardamom, lemon, and white pepper, it rushes through to a more substantial finish of roasted walnuts, tobacco leaf, unsweetened chocolate, and oak. (Total Wine & More)"
2149,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Hudson Bright Lights, Big Bourbon New York Straight, 46%<review>
Distilled from 95% New York-grown corn and 5% malted barley. Vanilla ice cream, milk chocolate, orange zest, ginger snaps, fresh flowers, leather, and allspice on the nose. The mouthfeel is light, with notes of herbs, orange slices, vanilla, cinnamon, chocolate, almonds, and brown sugar. A smooth, spicy finish brings on a finale of orange tart, ginger, dried almonds, and a pleasant cereal note. Light but well spiced, with depth and balance. Best Value"
2150,"<price>160<rating>83<whiskey>The Singleton of Glendullan Master’s Art, 40%<review>Glendullan has reimagined itself with a trio of Travel Retail exclusives. This, the most expensive, has been given some secondary maturation in Muscat wine casks. It’s the most complex of the trio, with more citric elements, hints of hay, and some spice, while the richness and dried scented fruit of the Muscat is a good accompaniment to the sloe-like side of the distillery character. A thick vanilla component helps the palate along to a chocolatey finish."
2151,"<price>70<rating>76<whiskey>Westland Sherry Wood American Single Malt, 46%<review>With a mash featuring no less than six different kinds of malt and aged in four different barrels (two sherry, a bourbon, and heavy-char new American oak), there are lot of moving parts with this whiskey. A jammy, inviting nose features blackberry jam, raisin, apricot, and ginger. On the palate it’s a cacophonic mess: chocolate and peated malt clash and do battle to grab focus. Add some heavy char and sherry to the mix and it's a bloodbath."
2152,"<price>567<rating>88<whiskey>The Macallan Coronation (Spanish Oak Cask #190952), 55.7%<review>Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350"
2153,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Laphroaig 18 year old, 48%<review>Very smooth for Laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this whisky. Soothing honeyed malt, creamy vanilla, and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke, charcoal, and tar; along with more subtle brine, smoked seaweed, anise, ginger, and citrus. A gentler, creamier, more tactile, less medicinal Laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. Will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? That depends. I enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old, but I also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. The higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (Side note: I know this is a moot point now, but I would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48%, rather than 43%.)"
2154,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%<review>The formula for this whisky has changed slightly since its inception -- and I think for the better. They've added some Laphroaig into the mix of Caol Ila and Ardmore. This whisky demonstrates the layered complexity that can be achieved by marrying whisky from different distilleries and different regions. I particularly enjoy the rich maltiness and oily texture that provide firm bedding and flavor contrast to the classic Islay notes: tar, boat docks, brine, smoked olive, seaweed, and kiln ash. More subtle cracked peppercorn, mustard seed, and citrus fruit add complexity. Long, warming finish. Amazing how a small change in composition can significantly benefit the overall flavor profile of a whisky."
2155,"<price>9<rating>74<whiskey>Canadian Supreme, 40%<review>One of the Barton whiskies acquired by Sazerac in 2009, Canadian Supreme is a dry, dusty mixer that blossoms in ginger ale. Neat, the nose opens slowly to dried fruit, while the palate is grassy, almost mashy, with butterscotch pudding and a peppery glow. Though not at all tannic, still it becomes a bit pulling in the middle before giving way to prunes, raspberries, and maraschino cherries. The finish is surprisingly long and hot."
2156,"<price>58<rating>80<whiskey>Hedgehog, 40%<review>It’s not compulsory to follow a Scottish way of whisky making. M. Olivier Perrier in the village of Herisson the middle of the Auvergne has taken a bourbon base (65% corn with malted barley and rye) and distilled it in a Cognac-style alembic before aging it for three years in Troncais oak. Any thoughts that M.Perrier is digging deep into his terroir can be quickly dismissed: the recipe is one for moonshine extracted from a South Carolina musician! His whisky (or should that be whiskey?) is fat and oily, with lots of corn and the scented note that these French whiskies all seem to share. It has a palate where the deep and the savory dance around each other that, while not exactly controlled, would be perfect to accompany an evening of blues in the middle of France. €37 "
2157,"<price>17<rating>76<whiskey>Old Charter, 40%<review>Named after the Charter Oak tree from the 1800s, this brand offers decent value. Sweetness and grain come and go, with hints of baking soda and dandelions. Think cooked grains, in presentations like cornbread and fresh-baked rye bread. Unfortunately, this is too much of a one-trick pony, falling into those pronounced grains that don’t offer much more. But there’s no doubt about it: it’s worth the money. Remember, value."
2158,"<price>592<rating>91<whiskey>The Dalmore Port Collection 1996 Vintage, 45%<review>Dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes. The pick of the bunch is the oldest, distilled in 1996, which displays a confident, rich nose of raisins, mildly smoky prunes, vanilla, and blood orange. Full-bodied in the mouth, with red berry fruits, ginger, white pepper, and spicy oak. Medium-length in the finish, with coffee-soaked oak, figs, and damsons at the close. £450"
2159,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Ohishi 11 year old Sherry Cask-Finished, 41%<review>

The nose has plum flesh, sanded oak, allspice, and walnut shells, but it’s a little undemonstrative. The redemption comes with tasting. Here, lush sherry notes wash over the tongue in waves as it shows dark fruits, plum wine, toffee, fresh fig, sultana, tobacco leaf, walnut, and orange peel. Don’t overlook this whisky; just take a quick sniff, then luxuriate in the fine sherry cask flavors on your taste buds. (888 bottles)—"
2160,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Forty Creek John K. Hall Small Batch Bourbon, 40%<review>Created by distiller John Hall to celebrate his fifteen years of making whisky. It really is a whisky that defies categorizing. More body than most Canadian whiskies; softer and less aggressive than bourbon. When compared to Forty Creek Barrel Select (John’s standard whisky), it’s richer, more velvety, and sweeter on the nose and palate. Notes of toffee, silky caramel, mixed nuts, exotic spice, and a hint of marmalade. A soothing, almost rummy, very drinkable whisky. 
"
2161,"<price>135<rating>82<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glenrothes) 7 year old, 67.4%<review>Massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. There’s light raisin, date, and fig roll/treacle toffee, but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive, it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts, aren’t talking to each other. Water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. On the palate, the black fruits and Demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. It’s tannic already, though. Lacks integration, but what else to do?"
2162,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 21 year old Glenburgie 1998 Single Cask (Cask No. 900896), 55.2%<review>Powerfully tropical on the nose, with guava, jackfruit, mango, and papaya in spades; hibiscus, blueberry-pomegranate juice, almond, and a hint of caramel drizzle as well. The palate delivers on that aromatic promise, bursting with guava and papaya, as well as mouth-puckering citrus and almond pastry. The lengthy finish is still fruity but leans into dryness, with almond and clean cereal notes and, at the last, a wisp of cigar. Don’t be afraid to add water if you wish to reduce the alcohol; the intense flavors remain. (251 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2163,"<price>41<rating>80<whiskey>Goldlys PX Finish Cask 2650, 43%<review>The ‘Golden River’ was nicknamed after the color of the River Lys due to rotting flax. Here, a cool, breezy nose of lemongrass and almond paste meets aromas of black currant conserve and blueberry muffin as the sherry flavors try to cut in. There are initial dark, jammy fruits hidden in warm bakery goods, with damson, bramble, and malt, swept aside by flavors of mint, antiseptic, and Fisherman’s Friends. The finish is clean and icy cool with penetrating aniseed. €38"
2164,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Yellowstone 9 year old Limited Edition Kentucky Straight (2019 Release), 50.5%<review>There’s a bounty of nuts here—almond, walnut, and pecan—along with vanilla, nougat, poached pear, and some beeswax notes. Initially the palate is citrus-loaded, with zesty grapefruit peel and cut orange wedges, but it quickly succumbs to drying oak tannins, showing a bit of heat as toasty oak, bitter chocolate, and cinnamon carry the finish. (12,500 bottles)"
2165,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>The Famous Grouse, 40%<review>Matthew Gloag introduced this classic blend in 1896, and now Kirsteen Campbell, master blender of Grouse since 2016, is taking it to new heights. Rich toffee, boundless baked orange notes, wood spices, dried banana chips, and some sweet floral top notes. Very smooth drinking, with citrus flavors, toffee and caramel, vanilla, ground ginger, star anise, and lemon peel. The spiciness abounds into the finish with well-rounded dark orange notes."
2166,"<price>37<rating>80<whiskey>Copper Fox Single Malt Whisky, 48%<review>Wood-smoked malt, a spirit aged in oak with fruitwood chips added makes for a distinctive, idiosyncratic whisky. Nose is warehouse reek, mellow fruitwood smoke, and sweet, light pipe tobacco, with a slight hint of cinnamon. Mouth is hot, but soft, with lots of malt and that unfamiliar flow of fruitwood smoke. Thin and edgy up front, but as the smoke spreads and the malt sweetens, it evolves. Finish is a bit abrupt."
2167,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2017 Release), 53.95%<review>This is an ode to this bourbon’s old-school style that, post-caramel and cinnamon, is balanced with dried blueberries, sweet cornbread, nutmeg, saffron, citrus, and slight hints of chipotle, ginger, and clove. Under the beautiful spice come vanilla cake batter, almond butter, and salt water taffy that walk it to a finish that just doesn’t quit. It’s the vanilla-forward finish that makes this an upper-echelon whiskey. (13,800 bottles for the U.S.)"

Bright amber, with maple syrup, vanilla, candy corn, white chocolate, cinnamon, and ripe berried fruit. Nice tannic grip, especially on the finish. Great balance between the sweetness, fruit, and tannins. This is what finishing is all about: giving more than it takes away (or masks). Nicely done!

Fresh pineapple and vanilla toffee on the fragrant, soft nose. The palate is lively and fruity, with lemon zest, caramel, a hint of black pepper, and then deeper fruit notes of ripe peach. The finish is quite lengthy, with lingering fruit flavors. £55"

The casks in question are tonneaux de vin rouge from Saint-Julien, and distillation took place on June 23, 1998. Just 450 cases are available globally. Sweet berries on the early nose, with milk chocolate, ginger, and spicy oak. Malt, ginger, plums, and honey on the rich palate, while the long finish offers spicy malt and honey."
2171,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>Chivas Regal Ultis, 40%<review>The first blended malt to carry the Chivas Regal name was created as a tribute to the legacy of the five master blenders, from Charles Howard in 1895 to Colin Scott. Malts from five of Pernod Ricard’s Speyside distilleries (Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval) were used to create intricate and elaborate flavors. Even more enchanting than the story are the aromas of fresh red apple, cherry, peach, and mango, mingled with cinnamon and dry heather. This luxurious whisky delivers dark vanilla, soft fruits, chocolate-dipped Brazil nuts, and is cloaked in sumptuous layers of caramel, wood spices, and gingersnaps. Outstanding.

One of a seemingly never-ending stream of Imperials from Duncan Taylor, all of which show remarkable consistency and are rarely over-wooded, thereby allowing the distillery character to shine. Here are echoes of Loire Sauvignon Blanc — nettles, gooseberry, cut grass, fennel tops, and fresh herbs — with a hint of Imperial’s giveaway American cream soda softness. The palate is as soft as soy milk. Classic Imperial.£38"

Mossman Pink Gold Crown 18 year old, 40%<review>On safe territory here, with neroli oil, caramel, roasted spices, surly peat smoke, and just enough fruity sweetness to stay in the good books. Weightier than the 15 year old, with more aged whisky characteristics: bright clementine, dried citrus wheels, and clove, but after an eruption of smoke, it fades to pineapple, fermenting fruits, and a prickly grapefruit acidity. The ashy embers on the finish retreat quickly."
2174,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft Quarter Cask Finished, 43%<review>Gently sweet vanilla, corn, and honey on the nose, with background spice and dried citrus. The same sweet notes show on the first half of the palate, with resinous oak, polished leather, and dried spice on the back end; the quarter cask aging is evident. Unfortunately, the sweet flavors and dried oak influence don’t marry very well, with too much sweetness and youthfulness up front, and too much oak bringing up the rear."
2175,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>Dalwhinnie 15 year old, 43%<review>Along with Cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK, it isn’t smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle, it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty."
2176,"<price>62<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfiddich Select Cask, 40%<review>Another from Glenfiddich’s three new solera vats, here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of American oak, red wine casks, and a smidgen of sherry. Think of hyacinth, ultra-fresh William pear, light barley, and grass. Zesty, clean and light, and ridiculously drinkable with a silky feel in the middle of the tongue. Quite a bargain.

This year’s batch thrusts equally boldly, but starts in a more Japanese-accented fashion: think soy, miso paste, and salmon teriyaki. Light leather, with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. The big, oily, tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on Bowmore High Street.

2178,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Garioch Cask No. 986 13 year old, 55%<review>A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this whisky (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun whisky, suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) "

Good color; nose is frisky and young, with fresh oak and big pear aromas, and a hot feel. Hot and direct in the mouth: grainy, some of that pear, and a somewhat bland but appealing cereal sweetness. Finish is more of the same, with a flick of heat at the end. "

The finish is spicy and powerful, with semi-sweet chocolate, raisins, walnuts, leather, and pipe tobacco.

2184,"<price>135<rating>88<whiskey>Blackadder Single Cask #30013 (distilled at Linlithgow) 1975 Vintage, 28 year old, 45% ABV<review>Also known as St. Magdalene, this Lowland distillery which closed down for good in 1983 is becoming increasingly more difficult to find. And when one does become available, it will be pushing 20 years old or older, like this one. When young, Linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability, with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. How does this older one fare? Quite well, actually. I was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence, given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. While those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes, they are never excessive. Instead, they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, lemon gum drops, grass and hay. I am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry, spicy finish. Certainly one of the best Linlithgows to come onto the market.

2185,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Sazerac Rye, 18 year old, 45%<review>Deep and complex, yet still quite lovely for an 18 year old whisky. Not as a lush and sweet as its younger sibling (Thomas H.Handy), showing more oak, dried spice, and a certain degree of sophistication. Toffee and molasses are quickly matched and then dominated by notes of brittle mint, vanilla, cinnamon, dried fruit, and black raspberry leading to a long, earthy, resinous, polished leather finish. The last great vintage of Sazerac Rye 18 year old was 2005, which was impeccably balanced and still displayed great youthful qualities. The three vintages since then, including this one, are similar in flavor profile and, while still very nice whiskeys, show just a tad too much oak and lethargy to reach the classic status of the 2005 release."
2186,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Driftless Glen Rye, 48%<review>Classical fruity rye notes of orange, green apple, and blueberry on the nose, along with fresh-baked muffin and a whiff of new oak. The palate is somewhat arch at first, but it quickly melts into honey, warm chocolate sauce, caramel, cinnamon, baking spice, orange candy, walnut, and a hint of pipe tobacco. The finish is light and well-balanced, with more orange, along with chocolate malt, caramel, iced tea, and black pepper."

After the controversy surrounding the 15th Anniversary edition, this time it’s all about the whisky. Sweet tangy orange, bitter peel oils, dark chocolate, clove, peppercorn, and nutmeg glide into menthol, spice, beeswax, and espresso on the finish. Solid gold: this is what they do best.

It is soft and sweet to drink, with lemon sherbet notes, some fruity piquancy, and rich butterscotch, with some peppermint creeping in on the finish."
2189,"<price>154<rating>84<whiskey>Lark Single Cask LD126, 43%<review>Although the Aussie whisky-making industry started in Tasmania, the distilling bug is spreading across the country. Small-scale the distilleries may be, but the use of brewer’s yeast, local peat (in Tasmania’s case), and wood sourced from the wine industry has immediately given Aussie whisky an identity of its own. Yes, it’s tiny, but every great new whisky, no matter where it is from, chips away at Scotch whisky’s hegemony. Tasmanian-based Bill Lark is the founding father of the modern Australian whisky industry. He uses local peat and ages in small casks — and only does single cask releases. This means that by the time a tasting note is written the whisky has gone, but here’s what I thought of one of them. There’s a glimpse of some fresh malt, but it is the heightened aromatics that are the most interesting here. Lark points to the yeast mix as the origin of this scent. His small stills, however, give a muscularity to the palate, while the oak is in balance. €99 "

Why do I get the feeling I’m about to tuck into dessert? Just-cooked berries with brown sugar crumble, marzipan, toasted coconut flakes, vanilla, and orange wedges on the nose. More fruit cobbler, brown sugar, sweet toasted nuts, Nutella, and rich spice on the palate, which turns from chewy to silky with water. The finish goes on for days, laden with red fruit, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, and well-integrated spice."

Undaunted by recent flooding and with more than three decades of aging whisky on hand, the owners recently decided to emphasize premium whiskies. Ninety, the latest of these, is simply gorgeous.

Sweet/smooth in the mouth, with sweet mint, rock candy, and gliding King syrup flavors slipping all over the tongue, while oak notes provide high spiciness. Finishes with a lingering light sweetness, like a dissolving sugar flake. With all the sweetness, though, it doesn’t cloy. Nice, if not complex."
2193,"<price>112<rating>83<whiskey>Teerenpeli 10 year old, 43%<review>Bourbon and sherry cask maturation were used for this bottling, which marks a milestone for the Finnish distillers. This has a nose of fresh cut apple, scrunched orange peel, malt, lime zest, and digestive biscuits drizzled with sesame oil. Lemon sherbet, cremola foam, and custard Danish start in a sweet direction, though it speedily converges prismatically to a trio of flavors comprising spearmint gum, menthol, and clove. Water only enhances the menthol. A cool, minty finish with residual sweet juices."

This release is Caol Ila on steroids, featuring a deeply smoky and meaty nose with bacon, campfire, leather, sea salt, and iodine. On the palate, the smoky fire continues to burn with intense smoke and salt combined with sweet honey malt.  An extremely long finish will have you exhaling smoke long after the dram is gone.

2197,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>New Holland Cask & Smoke Whiskey, 45%<review>Peat-smoked American malt whiskey. Nose isn’t so much peaty-smoky as it is sweet and husky; like cocoa bean mulch that’s been rained on a few times. The smoke’s there on the tongue, though, beautifully restrained, light and sweet. For small-barrel whiskey, this is surprisingly subtle, and the dance of the smoke is enticing. The oak’s a bit sharp though, and clamps on the finish; points off there. Promising."
2198,"<price>250<rating>91<whiskey>Glenfarclas 1974 vintage, 57.4%<review>Dark, chestnut-copper color suggests a sherry cask, and one nosing confirms it. A very multi-faceted whisky-the sherry is quite profound, but there’s a lot going on in addition to the sherry. Deep, succulent, and chewy on the palate, with fig cake, raisins, old rum, tobacco, pencil shavings, and almond fudge. Quite a mouthful!"

This whiskey is bright, cleanly malty, and quite fruity with a tropical accent -- peach, mango, cantaloupe, sultana, and caramelized pineapple. Balanced by notes of honey, vanilla cream, and soft coconut. The best Cooley whiskey I have ever tasted!"
2200,"<price>58<rating>84<whiskey>Glen Scotia Double Cask, 46%<review>This relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels, before a period in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks.

2202,"<price>12<rating>76<whiskey>Early Times (150th Anniversary Edition) Kentucky Whisky, 50%<review>A special limited edition release of Early Times whisky. Described as “Old Style Sour Mash” on the label. Simple, straight-forward notes of soft vanilla, sweet corn, light caramel, golden raisin, and (with some coaxing) subtle anise. Youthful on the palate, with a rather harsh, oak finish. I’m happy for the celebration, but a bit disappointed with the whisky. Two bottles of this (the volume equivalent of one standard 750 ml bottle) will set you back about $24, and there are many superior whiskies at this price point. Price is per 375ml bottle."

A fresh whisky with a hint of brine, along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge, embedded with dried fruit. Delicate oak resin peppers the finish, balancing the whisky’s sweetness. One of the best unpeated Tobermory whiskies (i.e. non-Ledaig) whiskies I’ve tasted. The sherry enhances the whiskey without dominating.

2204,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Barr an Uisce 1803 10 year old, 46%<review>To stand out in the increasingly crowded marketplace of sourced, single malt Irish whiskey, you need a good, original hook: this whisky is cut with Wicklow water. Shhh! Don’t tell St. Kevin. The bourbon casks have developed a sweet, honeyed nose with fresh hay, peach pit, and some mature oak characteristics. Lighter weight than the blend (see below), it relinquishes golden honey, satsuma, ground ginger, crystal sugar, and tame spices. Pleasantly drinkable and incontestably well-made, but the liquid needs greater individuality."

Savory beef juices, black fruits, particularly black currant, loose Keemun tea, and dense oak characteristics. Sweet baked orange with notable alcohols initially, then tangy with caramelized brown sugar, butterscotch, dark rum, Brazil nut, pepper, cacao, and black currant puree. With water, it tastes deliciously of chocolate. A serious heavyweight whisky."
2207,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>Often ignored because it’s not barrel proof like the other bourbons in the collection. The past couple years have shown a gradual increase in oak spice and resin. This year’s offering particularly sports unnecessary oak, showing more leather, dried spice (especially cinnamon), barrel char and tannins than needed to marry with the toffee, caramel, rum, mocha, dried fruit, and tobacco notes. Still very enjoyable, but slightly past its prime."
2208,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle 15 year old Family Reserve, 53.5%<review>Fully matured at 15 years, as you would expect. Lovely array of flavors: candied fruit, cinnamon, nutmeg, gritty oak resins, vanilla fudge, and firm corn.

I’ve tasted a few, and they vary to a degree. This is my favorite so far. Yes, there’s a lot of oak here (resinous, spicy, leathery, tobacco-tinged), but it’s on a bed of layered sweetness (nutty toffee, caramel fudge, maple syrup) that supports and marries with the oak. An ideal postprandial bourbon."

There’s a maritime note and prickly ginger on the nose, with a bit of smoke and a hint of cloves. Sinuous on the palate, with sweet cereal, big spicy peat, and dark chocolate.

Quite pungent, and that resonates rewardingly at the back of the throat. The juicy mandarin flavor has some tartness, but then there’s cake mix, gingersnaps, clove, and toasted spices, though it gravitates back to the marmalade. The finish has dry, bitter orange, ginger, and spice, with a hint of lime zest. Confident and characterful."

Soft, creamy vanilla foundation with a hint of marshmallow. Underlying notes of cut grass and linseed oil add texture and intrigue. Rosebank is a classic Lowlander and, given that the distillery closed in 1993, younger expressions will become more difficult to find (not to mention more expensive). Here’s a good whisky at a fair price.

One of my favorites so far from Bowman."

Pablum, sweet mash, grain dust, dry green hay, and linseed oil imbued with melon bespeak a telltale immature nose, while the palate, rich in grapes, peaches, and exotic tropical fruits, laced with hot cinnamon, allspice, and pepper, denotes maturity. Blue clay, creamy barley sugar, and a soft waxiness temper gently-pulling oak tannins, while inklings of green apple peels round out a sizzling palate. (Victoria Spirits distillery only) C$100"

I particularly enjoy its delicately honeyed, floral, crisply spicy aroma, with underlying notes of vanilla cream and candied fruit. These flavors follow through on the palate, initially with honey-laced fruit, caramel, and soft vanilla notes, leading to a dry spiciness (mint, cinnamon) and refined oak. It finishes crisp and pleasingly dry. None of the flavors are dominant, and bottling it at 50% is a bonus.

The palate serves up some figgy fruit, dried cherry, and sassafras leaf, but the style is clearly oak-driven, perhaps hinting at roasted chestnuts and some dusty, stale spices. Even with water, it remains a bit hot, and while somewhat angular oak lacks integration and holds it back from greatness, there’s still a lot to enjoy for wood fans."
2234,"<price>45<rating>83<whiskey>John Myer Four Grain, 45%<review>Mashbill of 47% corn, followed by rye, wheat, and barley. Aromas of golden fruit with grassy freshness (hay and floral notes) turn a bit more plump and juicy on the palate, with apricot, raspberry, and some tropical fruit—pineapple and mango—emerging. Orange-peel citrus character is lifted by white pepper spice before the oak-laden, leathery, drying finish."
2235,"<price>39<rating>88<whiskey>Hatozaki Finest Blended, 40%<review>Spring flowers, vanilla, toasted coconut, lime zest, and cashew make for an understated nose. Coupled with its delicately light tone, this feels like it was designed for sipping while contemplating a zen garden. With Creamsicle, coconut, orange, kumquat, and fluttering spices, it is further enhanced by dried strawberry, raspberry, and a spicy aftertaste. Delightfully unhurried development of flavors."
2236,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2017, 48%<review>A beautiful opening of oak, butterscotch, and fruit quickly becomes more pronounced in banana and pineapple. Then baked apple, Bananas Foster, caramel pudding, and salt water taffy. Hints of smoke and paprika lurk, but marzipan and orange blossom honey nail the landing. The finish doesn’t hold up to the palate, only offering a hint of caramel. Very good, but not quite outstanding."
2237,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan Podium, 46%<review>The mark of a good distillery is consistently producing 85 points-plus whiskies, and with this batch Kavalan's going into double digits. If the distillery has a weakness, it's that sometimes it overstates its case and makes even the Aussies look subtle and nuanced. Not here. This is a delicious dessert whisky, with vanilla and toffee in abundance and some sugar candy. But having made its case, it steps back and is surprisingly gentle. Kavalan with subtlety? Scary! "
2238,"<price>120<rating>80<whiskey>McDougall's Selection, 13 year old, 54.7%<review>A blend of four different Islay malt whiskies. A pungent, merciless Islay whisky with intense peat reek, tarry rope, and raw seaweed. Fiery cinnamon, clove, evergreen, and unsweetened black licorice stick just adds fuel to the fire. An underbelly of vanilla malt and suggestions of coconut cream try to douse the fire, but it's a losing battle. Long, seemingly endless burning ember finish."
2239,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Entrapment 25 year old, 41%<review>A captivating nose presents hints of polished leather shoes and clean oak. Less sweet than expected, Entrapment goes straight to long-evolved high esters, dried figs and dates, green fruits, and soaring fruity floral notes. Its spicy finish lasts forever. This very complex and tightly integrated whisky has all the woody, acetone-like glories of long-aged scotches. Then finally, some barley sugar, but only after sitting long in the glass."
2240,"<price>130<rating>86<whiskey>The Balvenie DoubleWood 17 year old, 43%<review>A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed."
2241,"<price>113<rating>91<whiskey>Glen Scotia 18 year old, 46%<review>New for 2017, this was matured for 17 years in bourbon casks before being finished in oloroso sherry casks for 1 year. The nose is fragrant, with prunes, oranges, vanilla, and faint wood polish. Ultimately, ozone. Silky palate delivery, with sweet sherry, honey, and dark chocolate-coated orange fondant creams, then a note of angelica. The finish offers spicy plain chocolate and a suggestion of sea salt. £86"
2242,"<price>70<rating>81<whiskey>Taketsuru 12 year old, 40%<review>“At last!” they cry. Anchor Distilling is bringing in whiskies from Nikka. I taunted you with the first of the initial brace in 2010, the exemplary Yoichi 15 year old (a hefty 95 points). The second is the firm’s vatted malt, Taketsuru 12 year old. A mix of Yoichi and Miyagikyo distillates, it is the latter which is to the fore here: a honey-laden mix of cut flowers, persimmon, vanilla, and apple. More are on their way.  "
2243,"<price>165<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut Spectrum 004, 50%<review>Although it sounds more like the warped master plan of a sinister Bond villain, it’s actually named after the four different woods in Amrut’s second wave of spectrum casks. Prune stone, dried fig, black cherry flesh, raspberry, cinnamon, and a hint of macchiato aromas. Dense concentrated cherry and sultana, cooked apple and pear, heavy spices, and fruit and nut chocolate. Finish of hot, sticky dates and baked orchard fruit. Commendable."
2244,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Bowmore Devil’s Casks 10 year old, 56.9%<review>Matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under Satan’s spell."
2245,"<price>265<rating>85<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 1989 25 year old, 45%<review>Pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time, there’s Starburst sweets. Some heat, even at this relatively low strength. There are mineral accents and, with water, the signature ginger. The palate is very sweet and soft with jelly fruits. Clean and supple, especially with water. Zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance."
2246,"<price>15<rating>82<whiskey>Very Old Barton Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Somewhat forgotten, this table bourbon is ripe with fired-corn salsa, citrus zest, and a hint of butterscotch. It could use another year or two in the barrel, but the grains, caramel, and fruit (with a hint of spice) are delicious on their own. Want a house bourbon for cocktails? This is a fine pick."
2247,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Bourbon Matured, 46%<review>As with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish."
2248,"<price>749<rating>89<whiskey>The Half Century Blend, 45.5%<review>This is how to age gracefully. A remarkable, decadent drop released to follow the success of the Golden Age blend, this delivers heather honey, tangerine juice, banana chips, dried apricots, and sanded oak. It’s a whisky of big, expansive flavors. Citrus strands, candied peel, neroli, and dried mango swirl amidst a syrupy mouthfeel, steadily becoming creamier as it squeezes out yet more flavor. Dry, oaky finish with residual fruit, coffee beans, and pleasingly bitter oak tannins that tingle the gums. £600"
2249,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Tamnavulin Double Cask, 40%<review>The first house release of Tamnavulin since the 1990s. Sherry, hazelnuts, ginger, cinnamon, and milk chocolate on the nose. Medium-bodied, with sweet sherry, damsons, light spice, and toffee on the palate. Fruity oak in the finish."
2250,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Booker’s 2020-01 “Granny’s Batch” Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 63.2%<review>
A sack of dried corn and a basket of roasted peanuts go hand in hand with iced tea, Coca-Cola, dark berries, caramel, and earthy clay barn floor. Unsurprisingly brawny and chewy in the mouth, it’s packed with dark chocolate-covered peanuts, cola, cooked cherries, chocolate tart, and tingling spice that carries well into the finish, which also keeps up the dark fruit and peanut flavors."
2251,"<price>87<rating>89<whiskey>BenRiach Solstice 15 year old, 50%<review>A heavily peated BenRiach that has been finished in a tawny port pipe. The nose is akin to cherries, sloes, and blueberries soaked in alcohol. The peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate, but is never too dominant. An oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. Great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53"
2252,"<price>2260<rating>88<whiskey>The Dalmore 30 year old, 45%<review>Following on from its limited edition 21 year old release, Dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression, with 888 numbered bottles being available. Matured in a mix of Matusalem oloroso and Amoroso oloroso sherry butts sourced from the Gonzales Byass bodega. The nose is slightly meaty, with coffee, sherry, and stewed apple. Supple on the palate, with dark, spicy orange, black currant cordial, and marzipan. Spicy tannins kick in during the very long, fruity, finally mouth-drying finish."
2253,"<price>32<rating>85<whiskey>Henry McKenna 10 year old Barrel No. 693, 50%<review>Single barrel, and not chill-filtered. Notably spicy (especially cinnamon) and gripping on the palate — the ten years in oak are not lost here. Some botanical notes too, especially toward the finish. Somewhat aggressive, but underlying notes of caramel, candy corn, and ripe tangerine help soften the blow. Despite its slightly imposing personality, it shows character and never steps over the line. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.) "
2254,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Benromach 24 year old, 58.6%<review>This whisky combines the finer qualities of both the 18 year old and the 25 year old. It expresses the balance and purity of the 18 year old, while showing maturity found in the 25 year old. The lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky’s vibrancy and, like all the Benromachs, it’s mouth-coatingly thick and malty."
2255,"<price>750<rating>87<whiskey>Auchentoshan Bourbon Matured 1975, 46.9%<review>The latest triple distilled bottling from the Lowland distillery of Auchentoshan has been matured for 35 years in bourbon casks and is presented non-chill filtered and at cask strength. Just 500 bottles are available globally. Apple crumble and custard on the nose, with developing cereal notes. Smooth and enticing. Spice, fresh fruits, honey, and marzipan on the buttery palate, which ultimately becomes drier. The finish is long and discreetly drying, with spices, malted barley, and a citrus tang in the tail. Price is approximate."
2256,"<price>89<rating>86<whiskey>REI Pure Malt, 40%<review>
Sweet and straightforward aromas of malt, cooked apple, butternut squash, vanilla, and pecans, sprinkled with dried flowers; water brings out lemon and grapefruit. Graham cracker and vanilla-sweetened pecan on the silky palate, along with gingery spice; again, water pulls citrus flavors to the fore. There’s more sweet malt, toasted oak, and chamomile tea on the finish."
2257,"<price>215<rating>85<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Caol Ila), 1984 vintage, 53.5%<review>Caol Ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope, seaweed, brine, and white pepper. All this is underpinned nicely by soft, sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. Subtle underlying juniper, horehound, and mint adds intrigue. Nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. Time has tempered this Caol Ila, but it has aged gracefully. 
"
2258,"<price>46<rating>83<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection (Made with Rice), 45%<review>Light and airy on the nose, and delicately creamy on the palate. Gently sweet personality, with caramel custard, vanilla bean, candy corn, and crème brulee. Shows more oak on the palate than the nose, with increasing dried spice notes on the finish. A peculiar whiskey, if not overly complex or inspiring.Price is per 375 ml."
2259,"<price>230<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut Norfolk Wine & Spirits Single Cask Single Malt (Cask #662), 60%<review>Expressive and aromatic on the nose, with mingling aromas of spiced smoke—like burning
sage—dried herbs, sandalwood, rose petal, and citrus oil. Its high proof equals big flavor on the
palate: a rush of guava, pineapple, and kiwi dusted with cinnamon, then almond, pipe tobacco,
and mocha. Adding water brings out more savory notes that meld seamlessly with the spice, nuts,
and rich dark chocolate. The lush finish swirls with chocolate, raisins, bitter almonds, and
tropical fruit. You’d be forgiven for thinking this was sherry cask-finished, but it’s actually from
a single bourbon barrel. (120 bottles; Norfolk Wine & Spirits exclusive)"
2260,"<price>30<rating>92<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates KelSo Pale Ale Edition, 40%<review>Of all the Caskmates, this edition representing Brooklyn is more complex, and offers a greater balance between the fruit and pot still spices than all the rest. There are bright floral notes, citrus, dry spices, and roasted barley—everything in perfect harmony. Clementine, honey, nuts, tropical fruit, a few savory elements, with finely ground spices fizzling away under waves of citrus fruit, candied peel, and flakes of chocolate."
2261,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Laphroaig Lore, 48%<review>Another NAS Laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. The nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. There are medicinal phenols, a biscuity note, then an aroma of fuel, like being on a trawler deck. The palate shows integration between the oaks, lending a smokehouse aroma. Water lightens, but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is Laphroaig. Like it."
2262,"<price>42<rating>82<whiskey>Tormore, 12 year old, 40% ABV<review>Soft and creamy in texture. A delicate mélange of fruit and a teasing nuttiness balance nicely with the whisky’s gently sweet notes of lightly toasted marshmallow and caramel, finishing soft and pleasingly dry. A very smooth whisky you could drink all day long. 
"
2263,"<price>27747<rating>94<whiskey>Balvenie 1971 vintage, 49.9%<review>This veteran was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. The nose is fragrant, with malt, raisins, and tangy orange in time, settling to stewed fruits; a pleasing harmony of aromas. The palate is chewy and spicy, with a lovely bitter-sweet interplay between orchard fruits and dark oak, sprinkled with icing sugar. Licorice, tannic oak, and bitter chocolate in the very long finish. A classic survivor. £21,000"
2264,"<price>410<rating>86<whiskey>Glenugie, Chivas Brothers, Deoch an Doras bottling, 32 year old, 55.4% <review>Recently added to Chivas Brothers’ lineup of Cask Strength Edition whiskies, this Eastern Highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of Glenugie in the fishing port of Peterhead is perfumed on the nose, with discreet sherry, cocoa, fresh leather, blackcurrants, peaches, and apricots. The palate is initially sweet, with fresh fruit, but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. Very long in the spicy, tannic oak finish. Exclusive to Chivas Brothers’ distillery visitor centers and www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com (500 bottles). £250 "
2265,"<price>418<rating>91<whiskey>GlenDronach Single Cask #5476, 49.9%<review>The oldest of the fifteen expressions in Batch 16 of GlenDronach’s single cask release program, this cask-strength offering has been matured for 26 years in a Pedro Ximénez sherry puncheon. The nose yields fresh-from-the-oven Christmas cake, cherries, nutmeg, and sweet leather. Viscous on the palate, with dark sherry, raisins, plain chocolate, tangy orange, and caramel. Prickly chili and dates in the long finish. (546 bottles) £310"
2266,"<price>99<rating>95<whiskey>William Larue Weller Kentucky Straight (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2020), 67.25%<review>
A complex nose of leather, cedar chest, black tea, cooked cherries, rich spice, and polished oak; water brings out bright citrus, green apple candy, and blackberry cobbler filling. Dark chocolate, cooked cherry, fresh ginger, licorice, black pepper, and nuts on the palate; spearmint, licorice, and tobacco appear once water is added. Extremely lengthy finish with licorice tea, caramel, dark chocolate, polished oak, and spearmint. You might want to tough it out at barrel proof, but water benefits this whiskey, and saves your taste buds."
2267,"<price>54<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfiddich 14 year old Bourbon Barrel Reserve, 43%<review>After 14 years in bourbon wood, this was finished in heavily-charred new American oak barrels, sourced from Kelvin Cooperage in Louisville, Kentucky. Malt, vanilla, and fudge on the nose, with ripe apples and lively oak. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, and cinnamon on the palate, while the finish is nutty, with notes of char. The closest Glenfiddich gets to producing a bourbon! Value pick"
2268,"<price>150<rating>93<whiskey>Highland Park 1983 vintage 23 year old (Cask #691), 59.8%<review>Very sophisticated and subtly complex. Perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. Fresh, appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, white pepper, and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla, with just a hint of fruit. The notes are bright, clean, and tight. Spicy, briny finish. A beautifully delicate Highland Park. (Bottled for Green’s)"
2269,"<price>115<rating>81<whiskey>Deanston Organic 15 year old, 46.3%<review>Deanston distillery has released its first organic single malt, aged for 15 years in new oak barrels. It is non-chill filtered.  Stem ginger, white pepper, cloves, and vanilla on the nose. The palate is rich with intensely sweet early fruit notes, honey, more ginger, and now black pepper. Becoming nuttier and slightly metallic in the finish with spicy oak and a hint of aniseed. (Germany and Travel Retail) £80"
2270,"<price>92<rating>85<whiskey>Glengoyne Teapot Dram (Batch #3), 59.4%<review>Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s, this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant, with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating, with lots more sherry, plus prunes, drinking chocolate, and a little oak. Lingering in the finish, with drying sherry, light spice, and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60"
2271,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Balblair 2003, 46%<review>Balblair Vintage 2003 replaces the previous 2002 expression, matured in second-fill bourbon barrels, with the contents of eighteen making up this first release. Tinned peaches and apricot jam on the nose, with underlying honey and caramel. Early malt, then zesty lemon notes on the palate, which also features freshly-cut grass and hazelnuts. The medium-length finish yields white pepper and cocoa powder."
2272,"<price>23<rating>86<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s Rye, 40%<review>J.P. Wiser’s signature is on the label, but the whisky itself bears the toasted-oak hallmarks of Corby master blender Dr. Don Livermore. There’s a lot to enjoy in this creamy, lush whisky. An initial blast of sweet caramel lingers as sour rye and bitter citrus pith emerge. These soon grow into hot gingery fizz and burned toffee. Dark fruits turn to citrus notes and cherry licorice while sizzling ginger mellows into softly glowing white pepper."
2273,"<price>53<rating>84<whiskey>Broad Branch Rye Fidelity 6 year old Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel No. 0027), 45%<review>Clearly young and grain-driven, this suffers from a few oddball aromas of pencil eraser and Play-Doh. The palate delivers heaps of sweetness, and an overload of vanilla, along with citrus oil and white pepper notes that succumb to a finish of new oak and mocha. Has merits, but lacking in structure and balance."
2274,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Blinking Owl Single Barrel Straight Rye (Batch 2), 45%<review>Is there such a thing as “beach rye?” Wafting breezes carry coconut, almond orgeat, and tropical fruit aromas, along with dried orange rind, chamomile tea, clove, mint, and earthy pecans. The easy-drinking palate has less fruit and more herbs, with licorice, spearmint, and allspice, underpinned by nuts and dry oak. Rounded out with orange blossom water, chai, dark berries, and more spearmint, allspice, and oak on the finish. This should come with a hammock."
2275,"<price>72<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice 1998 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory), 43%<review>Matured in refill, remade American hogsheads, this 1998 bottling from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull is of the peated Ledaig variant. The nose offers dry peat, brown wrapping paper, fish oil, and wood preservative. Oily on the palate, with bitter orange, sweet peat, ginger, and black pepper, plus fabric band-aids. Lingering pepper and Germolene in the ashy finish. £45"
2276,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Crown Royal Noble Collection Wine Barrel Finished, 40.5%<review>Until recently, Crown Royal, Canada’s best-selling whisky, took a conservative approach to limited-edition releases. The annual Noble Collection is a promising taste of the innovation underway at the Gimli, Manitoba distillery, which includes experiments with single grain wheat whisky, single malts, and more. This first venture into cask finishing uses Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. It is still Crown Royal, but on top of the bourbonesque vanillas and woody notes, rich red fruits jump from the glass. A new direction that moves Crown Royal into the realm of big, beautiful whiskies. Number 18 in the 2017 Top 20 "
2277,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Box The Pioneer, 48.1%<review>Although around 3 years old, the maturity has been achieved by using smaller, 40-liter bourbon casks (65% unpeated/15% peated whisky), with the remainder coming from peated whisky matured in Swedish oak. This adds a depth of character to the nose, the peat meeting honeydew melon, vanilla, caramelized bananas, grist, malty notes, and crushed hazelnuts. Sweet toffee apple, citrus, flapjacks, crackling spices, and barley grains play over a swelling, creamy smokiness. Simply stunning, considering its age. 837 SEK"
2278,"<price>126<rating>83<whiskey>Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1990, 51.5%<review>This refill barrel is perhaps more suited to those well versed in drinking grains regularly. The nose is herbal, with tarragon, endive leaves, and artichoke hearts, though there is balance from oat biscuits and honey. The palate begins clean and pure, builds complexity with vegetal notes and honey sweetness before delivering flavors of dates, nougat, wheat crackers, and dry, toasted spices. The drying finish has Quaker oats and sizzling spices. An acquired taste, this one, but not without merit. (162 bottles) £87"
2279,"<price>91<rating>88<whiskey>Fettercairn 16 year old, 46.4%<review>A 2020 addition to the Fettercairn stable, this expression was distilled using chocolate
malt, and matured in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing in sherry and port
casks. The nose is slightly meaty, with raisins, black treacle, white pepper, and dark
chocolate. Smooth on the substantial palate, with drinking chocolate, plums, black
pepper, cinnamon, and a savory note. Ginger, chile, instant coffee, and pipe tobacco
in the finish. £70"
2280,"<price>180<rating>90<whiskey>Chapter 7 (undisclosed Highland distillery), 55.8%<review>Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476). Malt, sweet sherry, cocktail cherries, milky coffee, and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. Very rich on the palate, with chewy-sweet soft fruits, notably strawberries, syrup sponge, and lively fruit spices. Mouth-drying in the long finish, with aniseed and wood spice. (1,076 bottles)"
2281,"<price>63<rating>85<whiskey>Bladnoch 9 year old, 46%<review>Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch, distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime, comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series. It offers a spring-like nose of cereal, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, meadow flowers, and a hint of milky coffee. Spicy toffee, apples, honey, and ginger on the palate, which finishes with a floral note, lemon, apples, and lively oak. £40"
2282,"<price>162<rating>88<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Solsken, 52.6%<review>Solsken comprises a parcel of smaller sherry and Swedish oak casks hand-picked by master blender Angela D’Orazio. The nose is like a basket of hot breakfast pastries, with honeycomb, tinned peaches, cinnamon, and hot teacakes with singed edges smoking from the grill. An amazing, golden taste that’s warm and soothing; sucked lozenges, mandarin segments, tame spices, and cobnut. The strength of the alcohol remains veiled in the shadows until the swallow…then it pounces. Mouth puckering finish of sharp fruit juices. €130"
2283,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank 14 year old Manzanilla Cask (#259), 54.8%<review>A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Complex citrus (orange, tangerine, lime, and a hint of lemon), honeyed malt kissed by maple syrup, caramelized pineapple, cinnamon, and a dusting of nutmeg. Nutty toffee on the finish. "
2284,"<price>580<rating>92<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1988 (Cask #434), 53.4%<review>Quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish. Here’s Glenfarclas taking a ramble on the wild side. If your preference is for more robust styles, then look no further. £345"
2285,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Stranahan’s (Batch 49), 47%<review>It shows nice maturity, considering it contains whiskey as young as two years old. Smooth, too, with layered sweetness (honeyed caramel, English toffee, maple syrup), tangerine, roasted nuts, and peppered with spice (warming cinnamon, glazed ginger). Good grip of tobacco and polished leather on the finish balances the sweetness that comes earlier. An example of the right way to do artisan distilling."
2286,"<price>85<rating>80<whiskey>Elements of Islay Bw1 (distilled at Bowmore), 52.9%<review>Though the color suggests good cask activity, the initial approach shows a dram that seems slightly unfocused and youthful. There are some kernel-like cereal elements and very little smokiness, with touches of salt and oil. The feeling is that it’s only starting to blossom — and there is a floral element — and has been bottled too early. It’s all very focused, lifted, and aromatic, but when compared to the Adelphi you can’t help but wonder whether the same distillery is involved.  "
2287,"<price>49<rating>77<whiskey>Two James Johnny Smoking Gun (batch 3), 43.5%<review>“Smoked” with a maceration of Lapsang Souchong tea (which leaves some fine sediment). Thickly sweet and herbal nose in a ruddy whiskey; like a sweetened, aged genever. On the palate, this 70% 7 year old MGP corn, 30% unaged Two James rye is woody and ash-bitter in the core, with a wrapping of that sweetness. The herbal character saves it from the squabble between sweet and bitter, but it comes off more as a tonic than a whiskey."
2288,"<price>350<rating>92<whiskey>Proof and Wood 25 year old 100 Seasons American Light Whiskey, 51.15%<review>

The nose is sweet with vanilla cupcake, crushed almonds, pecan sandies, Granny Smith apples, and Chinese coconut jelly. There’s a rancio element that pervades through the palate and finish—a bit like toasted oak, brown sugar, and even mothballs—that gives the whiskey gravitas to counterbalance the marshmallow and lemon bar flavors. Mellow and sweet, it has a lengthy finish that displays gentle finesse. (500 bottles)"
2289,"<price>199<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Stranger & Stranger, 46%<review>A defiant creation containing 1% 1 year old Girvan grain spirit and 99% malt whisky from Glenlossie, Glen Elgin, and Linkwood, this collaboration celebrates a decade of idiosyncratic and unconventional whisky label designs. It’s warm and effusive, with brown sugar on baked apple pie, Scottish tablet, plus orange and lemon peel. Barley sugar, kiwi, lime, brown sugar cookies, pepper, clove, and a smooth finish of sugar and spice. (4,802 bottles)"
2290,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Minor Case Sherry Cask Finished Rye<review>The sherry cask finish asserts itself right up front, with orange oil, sweet figs, cloves, and cedar; aromas of grape candy, peonies, spearmint, and allspice appear as well. While this is unabashedly a rye, with flavors of cinnamon, black pepper, and oak, the sherry comes to the fore again in the guise of grape soda, sweet cherries, and chocolate. The finish is sweet and oak-driven, with good length."
2291,"<price>242<rating>89<whiskey>Celtic Cask Sé, 46%<review>After 21 years in refill sherry, this whiskey was finished for 4 months in their preferred Mallorcan Ànima Negra barrels. Here, they achieve a sublime marriage of the sherry cask and finishing vessel, perfecting the aromas of fresh-sliced fig, sherry trifle, and crystalized pineapple. Tight and dense flavor, offering spangles, apricot jam, fragrant spices, raspberry, toffee, and maraschino cherry. Real quality and depth of character lasting through to the long, fruity finish of dates and stewed fruits. (328 bottles) €195"
2292,"<price>55<rating>93<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 64.95%<review>Thick, dark, sweet notes of rummy molasses, chewy toffee, fig cake, and some teasing notes of chocolate fudge. Between these layers of sweetness emerge notes of dark berried fruit and glazed citrus. A very seductive, compelling whiskey. Liquid dessert. 
"
2293,"<price>73<rating>82<whiskey>Glenturret Peated Edition, 46%<review>This expression comprises peated Glenturret malt (55ppm) and some older unpeated Glenturret malt. The distillery has been making peated malt for six years. There is a higher proportion of peated malt in this revised edition than in the previous version. Farmyard aromas on the nose, with an overlay of digestive biscuits and subtle smokiness. Light-bodied, with watery toffee and emerging peat smoke. Medium-length in the finish, spicy, with cigarette smoke. £47"
2294,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2007 Vintage (Barrel No. 724), 43.3%<review>Aged slightly more than 9 years. (The annual single barrel releases jumped last year from approximately 10 years old to 9 years old, with both a 2005 and 2006 vintage released in the same year.) A mélange of fruit (apricot, candied citrus, pineapple, golden raisin) spiked with fresh mint and cinnamon on a bed of caramel and vanilla. In true form, this bourbon is flavorful and well-rounded."
2295,"<price>21<rating>81<whiskey>Highwood Rye, 40%<review>Creamy butterscotch soothes the blazing hot spices of this archetypal Canadian mixing whisky. Fresh kiwi fruit and lime fragrances add dimension to a sweet, glowing middle, then fade on a long toffeeish finish that finally slips into slight hints of bitter grapefruit pith. A sweet, simple, and fruity session whisky that you could sip neat all evening, or over ice at a sunny poolside. A mixer, yes, and a sipper too. (Canada only) C$26"
2296,"<price>130<rating>85<whiskey>Balblair 1991, 43%<review>Here’s the older sibling to the 1997 vintage released in U.S. at the same time. It costs twice as much as the 1997 vintage, and guess what? I like the less expensive 1997 vintage better (because of its lovely balance and creamy texture). Still, this 1991 vintage is a nice whisky, rich with vanilla, coconut cream, citrus (orange, tangerine), pineapple, and sultana. A soothing, mouth-coating texture lingers, with some polished oak on the finish."
2297,"<price>45<rating>93<whiskey>George T. Stagg 15 year old, 68.7%<review>Antique amber color. Thick, mature aromas of toffee, leather, candied fruit, and mint. The aromas are tightly bound at cask strength but open up with a bit of water to reveal spicy wood resins and a hint of tobacco. Thick, almost chewy in texture. Its flavors are similar to its aroma (and nicely balanced), with the sweeter notes (toffee, candied fruit) up front and the drier, more spicy notes (mint, wood resins, leather) beginning in the middle and continuing to its finish. A lovely balance of flavors and not one bit too old or woody."
2298,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Sapling Vermont Maple Rye Whiskey, 35%<review>Located in the heart of Vermont’s syrup belt, Saxtons River distillery makes both a Vermont maple-flavored rye and a maple-flavored bourbon whiskey. The rye is the better of the two and does a solid job of mixing oak, cinnamon, black pepper, and rye spice notes with vanilla and rich maple syrup. The rye whiskey is a little young, but the maple syrup complements it well and is more companion than cover."
2299,"<price>920<rating>92<whiskey>Glengoyne 30 year old (2018 Edition), 46.8%<review>This second annual limited release was matured in a combination of first-fill European oak sherry butts and refill sherry butts. Spicy orange marmalade on the nose, with plums dipped in honey, warm leather, polished oak, and cinnamon. The palate is oily, with dark sherry, cocktail cherries, ginger, espresso, and sweet oak. Lengthy in the finish; spicy, with dried fruits. (5,200 bottles)"
2300,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Cragganmore 12 year old, 43%<review>This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks. "
2301,"<price>110<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Private Release St. Agrestis Brooklyn Amaro Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Blend No. CH24), 56.95%<review>

The reticent nose reveals little at first, but eventually a few aromas emerge: vanilla, licorice tea, furniture polish, and a slightly tart note, like gooseberry or kumquat. That’s borne out with the palate’s tart and citric character, showcasing plum, pear, lemon, gooseberry, and kumquat, with an herbal tinge, toasted oak, and a hint of almond. The finish is mouthwatering—almost mouth-puckering—and continues the tart fruit theme. This is an odd but intriguing whiskey, showing great consistency and novelty."
2302,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Spirits of French Lick The Wheater Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>A blend of two straight bourbons—a pot still expression from Spirits of French Lick, double distilled and aged 2 years, and a pot-and-column still bourbon sourced from a Wyoming distillery, aged 7 years. A youthful nose is grain-forward and restrained, with notes of dried leaves, crushed juniper berries, and licorice. A palate of bitter orange and black tea, finishing with clove, baking spices, bitter chocolate, and baked apple."
2303,"<price>52<rating>86<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Speyside) 17 year old, 53.4%<review>Few single malt whiskies from the Speyside Distillery make it to the U.S. This noses like a gammon joint glazed with sliced orange and a side order of sugar mice. Hesitantly, a sip brings relief with dark chocolate, stewed rhubarb, strained raspberry juices, walnut, and burnt bakery goods. Dry finish with remnants of cocoa. Worth experimenting with water, as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out."
2304,"<price>55<rating>91<whiskey>Cotswolds 2014 Odyssey Barley, 46%<review>It’s quite a tick list for their first single malt: 100% locally grown floor-malted barley, long fermentations, unusual yeast strains, innovative distillation cuts, and bourbon and shave-toast-rechar red wine casks. Honey, sugar-sprinkled shortbread, peach tarts, marzipan fruits, glacé apricot, finely shredded citrus peel, and young pink rhubarb. Flavors of heather honey, chili flakes, Christmas spices, caramelized sugar, malt; then marmalade, dried red fruits, and cappuccino. A great all-rounder. More please! (960 bottles)"
2305,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Double Oaked, 45.2%<review>Woodford’s first permanent line extension. Aged in two barrels with different toast and char amounts.  More visceral than the standard Woodford Reserve, with a darker personality, extra wood spice, and a nice sweet foundation. Notes of cinnamon stick, dark berried fruit, roasted nuts, caramel, creamy vanilla, and polished leather."
2306,"<price>455<rating>93<whiskey>Port Ellen 31 year old, 54.6%<review>Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year, which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me, this is up there with last year’s bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.
This is different, however. Yes, the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? — and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness,’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.
The palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. But don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complex…and there’s a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the U.S.] £280"
2307,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve Single Barrel, 52%<review>This non-chill filtered rye is bold and ready for a spice-hungry palate. At first the aroma gently introduces herbs, pepper spice, cinnamon, and vanilla; preparing for a hopeful taste of the same. Instead, there’s a surprise: toasted rye bread at the beginning followed by cinnamon and caramel, with a medium-length finish."
2308,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Clyde May’s Cask Strength Alabama Style 10 year old American Whiskey, 57%<review>The nose offers aromas of fragrant oak, baked apple, caramel, clove, cinnamon, bananas, and creamy vanilla, set against an herbal back note of tarragon. The palate offers cigar box, slate, chocolate, caramel, and chili pepper. Water coaxes fruit notes of blackberry, lemon, and cherry, as well as chocolate-nut cake. A long finish has notes of tobacco, warm chocolate syrup, and toasted almonds. Rich, layered, complex, and eminently pleasurable."
2309,"<price>64<rating>85<whiskey>Stalk and Barrel Cask 10, 46%<review>Ontario government retailer LCBO bought this barrel for an exclusive bottling, and it’s a doozie. The first nose is all fresh flaxseed before peppermint, anise, and sweet fragrant flowers waft in. A few minutes later the nose morphs into peach cobbler with lingering suggestions of dry grain. Cooked peaches sustain the palate until sweet spices arrive, bringing hints of oak and creamy barley sugar with them. There’s lots of action in this whisky glass. (Ontario only) C$70"
2310,"<price>33<rating>83<whiskey>Clyde May's Conecuh Ridge, 42.5%<review>Sweet corn and oak, with some green apple and grass notes; a light, pleasant nose that goes hot closer to the surface. Quite light and young in the mouth, clean, with understated oak notes; not taxing or tiring, and a long finish of teaberry and mint. Nothing amazing or overly complex, but a clean, pleasant sip of whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
2311,"<price>90<rating>87<whiskey>The English Whisky Co. Peated, 55.2%<review>There is wonderfully sweet smoke on the nose that overrides a base layer of fresh mint and mounds of velvety cocoa powder. Neat, there is a powerful alcohol kick, a harbinger of sweet purple berry fruits and brown sugar before it settles down as it dilutes with pools of calming milky cocoa and chocolate. Give this a good splash of water and it will reward you handsomely, unlocking extra layers of sweetness, fresh melon, and lime. (290 bottles, The Whisky Exchange only) £62"
2312,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, 1995 Vintage, 47%<review>The third straight year of Birthday Bourbon releases. Last year we were blessed with not one, but two practically flawless whiskeys (one quite richly flavored, the other light and delicate). This 1995 vintage is nearly as good and reminds me in some ways of the first Birthday Bourbon release two years ago. Sweet notes of caramel, maple, cocoa powder, and vanilla fudge (particularly on the front of the palate) are mingled with candied fruit and dry mint. The whiskey finishes fairly dry (more than its bouquet would suggest) with notes of polished leather, mint, dark chocolate, and dried tea. 
"
2313,"<price>88<rating>82<whiskey>Cadenhead’s 11 year old (distilled at Bowmore), 57.5%<review>Light and very creamy, with very subtle smoke in the background, this is like eating a white chocolate ice cream while walking toward a distant beach barbecue. The palate is gentle and sweet with good, refreshing saline balance. Water brings out mint. It’s just a little too tight and disconnected on the tongue."
2314,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Bomberger’s (batch 2), 43%<review>A blend: 89% 2 year 6 month old MGP bourbon, 11% 3 year old McKenzie rye. Other batches are different whiskeys. Sweet nose: some cinnamon and allspice, dried hay and “clear toy” candies. Hot on the tongue, with the spicy, peppery intensity of youth (and rye), and roars right on through to the end, where oak appears to add gravity to the finish. This would rock in a cocktail."
2315,"<price>80<rating>82<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Rye, 64.6%<review>Distilled in 2008, this is the youngest whiskey in the group. A vast departure from last year’s release — which was delicious — particularly on the palate. This year’s is thinner and less complex, with unintegrated spice, botanical, and vegetal notes dominating. Yes, there’s some honey, vanilla, bright fruit, and a hint of toffee, but it doesn’t help. Easily the weakest whiskey in this year’s Antique Collection, and a bit of a disappointment."
2316,"<price>85<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), cask #00/3454, 15 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%<review>One of a series of single cask, wine-finished Caol Ilas. This one is finished in a claret (Bordeaux) wine cask. The claret adds some bright red fruit notes (raspberry, red currant) and red licorice to accompany the smoke, brine, olive, and vanilla-laced malt. I have tasted some claret/Bordeaux wood-finished whiskies where the wine was too dominant, but this one achieves a nice balance. 
"
2317,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Standard Stave Drying Time, 45%<review>Well-defined flavors and clean on the palate. Wood is the driving influence here, showing plenty of dried spice throughout with a dry, resinous finish. The spice notes are accompanied by a layer of caramel, dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg), and subtle orchard fruits. The dry oak notes overstay their welcome for balance. Otherwise, it’s a very pleasant whiskey. Price per 375 ml.

 "
2318,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Jefferson’s Ocean Aged at Sea, 41.15%<review>A follow up to the original Jefferson’s Ocean, 62 barrels of mature bourbon spent 5 months at sea. Can I detect any noticeable sea influence? Not really—perhaps a hint of brine—but it’s nice, pleasant bourbon nonetheless with nothing out of place. Well rounded notes of layered sweetness (caramel, vanilla, maple syrup and a hit of sweet corn), honeyed orchard fruit, and spiced with cinnamon and evergreen. Soft, soothing finish. Sourced whiskey."
2319,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac 18 year old (bottled Fall 2012), 45%<review>A perennial classic. Not aggressively bold like its younger sibling (Thomas H. Handy), but this is a rye of distinction and class. Still quite vibrant for its age, with plenty of spice (cinnamon, soft evergreen, vanilla, hint of nutmeg) softened and balanced by sweet notes (caramel, toffee), glazed citrus, and dried oak on the finish. This remains the benchmark for what a mature rye whiskey should taste like.  "
2320,"<price>11<rating>75<whiskey>Ellington, 40%<review>Minnesota is a favored destination for Canadian vacationers from the prairies, and a hotbed for Canadian whisky. The Ellington Whisky Company calls Princeton (Minneapolis) home. Here, it bottles whiskies imported from Canada. Where from, exactly? A trade secret. Caramel, prune juice, ripe yellow fruits, and hints of cooked, buttery corn mute a dry, spirity nose. Peppery and spicy, it blends caramel, bitter lemon soda, sweet ginger, and orange Fanta. Canadian whisky unlike any found in Canada. But do add cola. C$11"
2321,"<price>78<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfiddich Reserve Cask, 40%<review>Here, a new solera vat is home to a Glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks, and shows its origins with deep, black fruitiness, orange peel, and sultana. The signature pears of ’Fiddich
here are dried and sit next to moist fruitcake. Ripe and long, with toffee, a pleasant wisp of sulfur, and blackberry. An easy-going sherried style that’s ideal for the beginner. (Travel Retail exclusive.) £49/1 liter"
2322,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Kilkerran Work in Progress 6 Sherry Matured, 46%<review>The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds, one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels, as was the case with release 5. 9,000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose, slightly earthy, with sherry, new leather, lemonade, and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty, with developing stewed fruits, dark chocolate, and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy, mildly smoky, with quite dry sherry notes."
2323,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Single Cask #1961 (distilled at Bruichladdich) 1989 Vintage, 57.9% ABV<review>It is unusual to find a Bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. I must admit that I generally like a less sherried Bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. While there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky, the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. This whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. Chewy caramel, toffee, and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky, with Bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. If you like Bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky, then I think you'll enjoy this one."
2324,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Auchentoshan 1999 Bordeaux Cask Matured, 58%<review>The 11 year old triple distilled Lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in French oak casks that previously contained Bordeaux wine, then bottled at cask strength. The nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes, red grapes and gooseberries, damp newspaper, warm stone, and vanilla. Herbal, with cloves and spearmint. Mouth-coating, bittersweet on the palate, with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. Dark chocolate, raisins, and aniseed in the drying finish."
2325,"<price>246<rating>90<whiskey>The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at Invergordon) 1972, 43.4%<review>Holy Moly! Where do they find them? Over 40 years old and this seizes your attention with a becoming nose of smoked ham, sweet paprika, and red currant jelly. It’s extremely fruity with just the right level of tartness to keep it in balance; pomegranate, strawberry laces, crystalized fruits, and a nip of licorice adding to the richness and emerging creaminess before a dry finish of Victoria plums. Simply a gorgeous old grain. (300 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) £155"
2326,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Doc Swinson’s 15 year old Exploratory Cask Series Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 18), 59.1%<review>Richly oaked, its maturity is evident in the walnut, cigar box, burnt sugar, toasted marshmallow, and waxy furniture polish notes. On the palate, it pours rich, dense, and chewy with sweet treacle balanced against tobacco leaf. Mouth-coating and warming with generous proof, figgy fruit, and cinnamon on the mid-palate, culminating in a finish of bitter chocolate and fine wood tannins. (2,600 bottles)"
2327,"<price>69<rating>86<whiskey>Adelphi Fascadale 12 year old Batch 5 (distilled at Highland Park), 46%<review>The fifth batch of Adelphi’s Fascadale single malt comprises a marriage of two Spanish oak casks and three American oak casks of Highland Park. The outturn is 1,483 bottles. Icing sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, apricots, plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. Full-bodied and fruity on the palate, with toffee, black pepper, and a hint of peat in the background. The medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45"
2328,"<price>25<rating>80<whiskey>Tomatin 12 year old, 43%<review>Pleasantly sweet. Good malt foundation with an abundance of bright summer fruit. Clean, straight-forward and uncomplicated.
"
2329,"<price>260<rating>95<whiskey>Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy, 46%<review>This is mastery of American oak! Polished wood, cinnamon cereals, dry spices of pepper, allspice, and paprika, and a riot of mostly overripe fruit: custard apple, mango, brown banana, baked apricot dessert, and fresh fig. Caramel, date slices, treacle, and cracker bread flavors are bathed in feisty pot still spices and fleeting green apple, before a lush, rich sweetness of banoffee pie, vanilla, and cinnamon descends. The finish is seemingly eternal."
2330,"<price>81<rating>82<whiskey>Mackmyra Midnattssol, 46.1%<review>Initial maturation in sherry and bourbon wood from the U.S. and Sweden, finished in fermented birch sap wine casks. Concentrated heather honey, wax, fresh mascarpone, fruit tarts, and toasted oak. It draws the mouth in: fruity, but not sweet. Stewed, dark fruits from the hedgerow and orchard (cherry, apple, plum, mulberry, and rhubarb), then a delayed splurge of spices and pepper, ending with Brazil nut, espresso, and bitter cacao. It’s all rather austere, serious, and forbidding. €65"
2331,"<price>20<rating>85<whiskey>Redemption White Rye, 46%<review>Very grassy, with dry earth and pink peppercorn layered in, but none of the heat you’d expect from unaged 92 proof rye. Very well-behaved on the tongue; oily, bittersweet, with the 95% rye mash rolling like an unhurried river, one long, smooth wave of rye flavor. A whiskey like this could be called too simple, but this is strikingly single-minded. A likely candidate for cocktails at the price."
2332,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Glenallachie 10 year old Cask Strength (Batch 2), 54.8%<review>Mellow on the nose, even at cask strength, with vanilla, lemon curd, honey, and warm ginger cookies. Strawberry jam notes emerge in time. An initial flavor of berry on the palate, then malt, honey, and slightly bitter oak. The finish features black pepper, more ginger, and jam-like notes. (2,400 bottles for U.S.)"
2333,"<price>75<rating>82<whiskey>Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2009, 50%<review>Using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. The yields are low, the mash thick and hard to work, but I’m delighted that Bruichladdich has persevered. It adds a more overt cereal note to the whisky, taking the Laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. There’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. It’s young, so add water to cut its more, er, bracing qualities. In fact, have it with ice and soda. (Travel Retail exclusive) £58"
2334,"<price>95<rating>89<whiskey>Waterford Single Farm Origin Dunbell Edition 1.1, 50%<review>
Chocolate Crispy Thins, graham cracker, barley, peppercorn, aniseed, ground exotic spices, and cracker bread, but there’s also some perceptible glue-like young whisky notes. The flavors on the palate show the inherent promise of Waterford: barley sugar, oat granola, baked orange, and hefty spices, particularly aniseed, followed by unsweetened cooking chocolate melting under the spice. This develops into chocolate-covered Brazil nuts and a deep warming glow on the finish. (U.S. Exclusive; 6,000 bottles)"
2335,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Method & Madness Acacia Wood-Finished, 46%<review>Equal parts fascinating and delicious, this has a clean and creamy nose with notes of Golden Delicious apples, vanilla, golden sugar, snuff, and a sprinkle of lime zest. Brown sugar, praline edging on chocolate flavors, stone and orchard fruits, vanilla, light toffee, and a late sensation of spices nipping the tongue. Dark toffee, coffee grounds, and bitter chocolate join the spices in the finish (2,500 bottles). (€92)"
2336,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Chattanooga Straight Rye Malt (Batch 20I22R), 49.5%<review>
An effusive nose, with aromatic notes that become almost incense-like—cardamom, cedar, pine resin—as well as sweet berry notes, lemon, milk chocolate, and graham cracker. The palate is fresh and intense; breathe out mint on the exhale. Licorice tea, cacao, horehound candy, and plenty of oak are carried by the chewy, full texture. Peppery mint, oak char, baking chocolate, and pine on the fairly lengthy finish. Sprightly, original, and exciting."
2337,"<price>49<rating>84<whiskey>Kings County Peated Bourbon, 45%<review>Now that’s something you don’t see every day. Kings County (Brooklyn, N.Y.) used peat-smoked malt in this bourbon. The nose is bonfire and sweet juicy corn; the undiscovered Hebridean Isle of Kentucky? The smoke is less forward on the tongue; you don’t get so much a peaty bourbon as you get an unusually rich, broad young bourbon. More warming corn, digestive biscuits, and a pleasantly hot finish. Compelling, and…what kind of Manhattan would this make? (400 bottles; at the distillery only) Price is per 375 ml."
2338,"<price>85<rating>88<whiskey>Deanston 2008 Brandy Cask Finish, 56.4%<review>This 9 year old Deanston spent almost 8 years in bourbon barrels before being transferred into French brandy butts for a final 2 years of aging. Cognac notes on the early nose, rich and spicy, with toffee, nutmeg, instant coffee, and rhubarb crumble. The palate is sweet, smooth, and buttery, with brandy, honey, and polished oak. The finish dries with licorice and chili warmth, then, finally, tangy dark berries. (3,432 bottles)"
2339,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Cask #4, 46%<review>Alberta’s Liquor Depot has chosen a tiny Ontario distillery for an exclusive single malt bottling. Still Waters, in Toronto, is Canada’s first craft distillery to bottle single malt whisky. This one is peppery hot and bathed in sweet barley sugar, clover honey, and rich oaky caramels. Brisk, nutty, and oaky, it remains sweet, with green pears. A weighty body, with grassiness, dry grain, and hot white pepper, typifies Still Waters’ emerging house style. (Alberta only.) C$70"
2340,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Suntory Toki, 43%<review>This is a handy core ingredient for many cocktails, combining single malts from Yamazaki and Hakushu with grain from Chita. Dying embers of burnt heather and aromas of sliced apples browning through careless neglect. A complex interplay between the smoky embers, roasted spices, tiger fruit, coriander, and whole peppercorn precedes a sweet taste of buttered popcorn, orchard fruit, and burnished orange, supported by increasingly provocative pepperiness. Quaffable and versatile."
2341,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company English Whisky 5 year old (batch 1), 49.5%<review>This hothead stomps around the place, lashing out the peaty punches, but this raw power comes at the expense of balance. Coal scuttles, crumbly compost, smoked grass, chocolate ganache, and aromas of pit-cooked, blackened joints of pork. A thin medley of lemon, grapefruit, and orange segments is smothered by dense plumes of smoke, even more peaty with a dash of water, and it billows its way to a finish of chalky, fizzy candy round a bonfire. Imagine a smoked Trebor refresher. (964 bottles) £40"
2342,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 16 year old Twin Wood Limited Release, 40%<review>The Twin Wood release is the result of refilling this triple distilled single malt from its bourbon casks into oloroso casks for a 21-month finishing period. This produced a wonderfully dry nose of macadamia nut, pepper, and baked apple crumble. Rich sweetness, more sherry fruit, and raspberry, which develop with plum notes, some bitter fruits, old chocolate, and a little heat. Fruity sweetness is maintained through the finish."
2343,"<price>101<rating>96<whiskey>Redbreast 12 Year Old Cask Strength, 57.7%<review>Irish Distillers has already released two 90+ pot still whiskeys this year, but this is the knockout blow, an immense take on the wonderful Redbreast. The nose gives little away, all damp autumn leaves and fermenting forest fruit, but on the palate it's a fireworks display, a colorful mix of apple and pear, berries, vine fruits, chocolate liqueur, and oily pureed fruit. It's coming to the States soon, and rumor has it there's more to follow. But this will do. I can't think if I've ever tasted a better Irish whiskey. €75"
2344,"<price>97<rating>86<whiskey>Langside Distillers (distilled at Auchentoshan) 16 year old, 48%<review>Distilled in October 1997 and aged in a single refill hogshead, 360 bottles were released in 2014 as part of Langside’s Distiller’s Art range. The nose is mildly herbal, with green wood, heather, and developing soft toffee notes. Soft and gently spiced on the palate, with hazelnuts, and peaches in cream. The finish is relatively long, with milk chocolate, and tingling sweet spices. £62"
2345,"<price>300<rating>94<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Kentucky Straight (Batch 9), 63.8%<review>A blend of different bourbons aged 15, 14, 12, 7, and 6 years. A bakery shop nose offers confectioners’ sugar and warm cherry pie. On the palate, wild strawberry and cooked fruit notes of baked apples and raspberry tart meld with tiramisu and black pepper, all well-balanced against leather and oak. The finish offers chocolate spice, raspberry, cinnamon, bitter almond, and lightly roasted coffee beans. Powerful but balanced, and superbly well-integrated. (10,314 bottles)"
2346,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Big Peat Christmas Edition 2015, 53.8%<review>Marginally less aggressive than in 2014, this Big Peat is more rounded and exhibits greater finesse. Overall, it’s a better whisky. The invasive smoke still infiltrates the skull and clasps your brain tightly. A sweet smoke of smoldering hillside wildfire extinguished by rubber beaters, balanced by meadow flowers, tree blossom, and honey. Sticky lemons smeared in thick honey, cracked black pepper, and a fabulous, almost gelatinous texture, it builds solidly in peaty intensity. Knockout! A hot, smoky finish like dragon’s breath."
2347,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Calumet Farm Single Rack Black 12 year old, 47%<review>Grainy and floral on the nose, with aromas of bananas Foster, pine resin, cardamom, lemon, iced tea, tart blackberries, and nougat. Kicky black pepper and cinnamon smooth out with a touch of water, yielding banana Popsicle, lemon bars, roasted pistachios, and cigar wrapper. A short finish with toasted oak, pecans, and nougat."
2348,"<price>40<rating>79<whiskey>Rough Rider Bourbon Batch 1, 45%<review>Fiery young stuff! The nose is spicy/slicey, with a sharp sweetness, fresh oak, and a hint of solvent. A lot of oak in the mouth, almost drying, and just a bit astringent on the tongue. The finish turns softer, sweeter, but stays oaky. The wood’s a bit overwhelming on this one. It’s sourced whiskey that’s then finished in Long Island wine barrels. Some finishes work better than others."
2349,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Bearface Triple Oak 7 year old, 42.5%<review>Lots of complexity follows the Canadian triad of caramel, pepper, and cleansing pith. Master blender Andres Faustinelli sourced 7 year old whisky in Okanagan red wine barrels then finished it in virgin, air-dried, 4 year old Hungarian oak. Rich oak and red wine on the nose lead to exotic spices, tingling peppers, burley tobacco, and vaguely phenolic grape skins on a buttery palate. Burnt sugar and chocolate cherries, then a long, spicy finish."
2350,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%<review>

The much-beloved Peat Monster was recently given a new recipe designed to create greater depth and elegance. The peat influence, while still omnipresent, is now more subtle. On the nose it’s gentle and fragrant, wafting over candied citrus, lemon-frosted cake, and raspberry, along with classic peated undertones of charcoal and iodine. The palate is creamy in texture, with pleasant notes of brine, seashells, ashiness, and a floral peat influence that swirls gently around rich vanilla, tropical hints of lime, smoked meats, and generous spice. The finish offers bitter chocolate, lemon hard candy, and a bang of spice and smoke. Number 9 in the 2020 Top 20"
2351,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Shieldaig 18 year old Highland, 40%<review>An array of flowers and fruits tumbles from the glass: lilacs, orange blossom, lemon oil, raspberry, blueberry, shelled walnuts, and a hint of licorice. Very light-bodied, but with entrancing candied citrus peel, bubble gum, and strawberry candy flavors, along with sherry cask notes of walnut, hazelnut, milk chocolate, raisin, and ginger. Sweet oak and berries on the finish, which is light but lengthy. (Total Wine & More)"
2352,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Stronachie, 12 year old, 43%<review>A “branded” malt, meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. Fresh and quite fruity (peach, nectarine, golden raisin, orange, pineapple) with a nice underlying honey, vanilla, and caramel sweetness. Soft, gentle, malty finish. It’s clean, nicely balanced, and pleasant."
2353,"<price>125<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Paul John 6 year old (batch 2), 54.7%<review>Great to see an age statement on this second Boutique-y Paul John release. It’s aromatic, with hoisin sauce, sweet plums, clove, black pepper, and a cloud of heady peat smoke. Sweet, dark toffees, vanilla, apple danish, poached pear, and baked orange swim above an undercurrent of peppery spice. Water provokes more smoke on the nose, more apples on the palate. The dry finish leaves singed vanilla and the satisfaction that you’re puffing out perfect smoke rings through pursed lips. (173 bottles) £100"
2354,"<price>123<rating>77<whiskey>Hellyers Road Original Pure, 46.2%<review>Hellyers Road is Tasmania's biggest distillery, formed by dairy producers who feared the island's dairy business was under threat from mainland producers and needed a fallback policy. Early bottlings were dreadful, but this is a big step forward. It's still an acquired taste, though, with rootsy, vegetal, and grassy Scottish Lowland elements. It's saved by a cocoa powder, mint chocolate, and puff pastry heart.  $AUS 120"
2355,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Straight, 47.5%<review>Spiced plums, spearmint, clove, dried ginger, fennel, lilac, and bubble gum on the nose. The palate is perfumy and well-spiced, with candied rose petal, blueberry, bubble gum, chili powder, black pepper, and chocolate, tingling with a racy, spicy, oaky finish. Now aged 4 years, this whiskey has shown improvement with every orbit of the earth and exhibits hallmark rye flavors: a perfect silhouette."
2356,"<price>840<rating>91<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2014 Edition, 46.8%<review>Smoke begins Jim Beveridge’s public replication of the annual Directors Blend concept, built around Johnnie Walker’s signature characteristics. Peat smoke harks back to Islay, but there’s wood smoke, tobacco leaf, and malt, with a salty richness behind it. The grain just gives it a lift of extra sweetness. Polished, with great structure; red apple, raspberry, and sweet linctus wrap up with a long, smoky finish of cigar stub and peat stores. Clear parallels with Directors Blend 2009, but better. (8,888 decanters released) £500"
2357,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Label 5 Gold Heritage, 40%<review>Master blender Graham Coull hand-selected a variety of aged stock and cask types for this new global addition to the Label 5 range. Vanilla, dark fruit, and gentle spices on the nose, but the appeal lies in the beautiful, clingy mouthfeel. Warm marmalade, nuts, and oak flavors with whispers of cinnamon and clove combine to produce a creamy, smooth dram. It builds and builds but never feels like it fully arrives. The finish is drying with dampened-down spices. €40"

This one is a lighter, more delicate example of the genre. Exotic notes of tropical fruit, citrus, vanilla, linseed, and honey combine with a gentle, fresh brine tang and some background dried spice. The flavors are slightly muted, but this is not surprising given its age. (A Park Avenue Liquors Exclusive.)"
2359,"<price>19<rating>88<whiskey> Label 5 Bourbon Barrel, 40%<review>How wonderful it is to have this single grain whisky added to the Label 5 range of blends! A heavy waft of vanilla essence, toffee, toasted nuts, and wood spice, but there is a clear grain character, no mistake: chopped herbs, perfume notes, mint leaf, and a whiff of nail polish remover on the nose. Light-bodied and delicious, with toffee, nuts, coconut macaroon, maple syrup, ground hazelnut, and oak char, with a nutty toffee finish. Best Value"
2360,"<price>320<rating>90<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 4), 56.1%<review>Heavy on the oak and spices, this has aromas of a carpentry shop, with salt and pepper, steak rub, and a touch of red fruit buried deep in the glass. It has quite a mouthfeel at cask strength; one of those whiskeys that makes your teeth squeaky. Vanilla, banana, and nicely balanced between the slowly unraveling spices, hazelnut, and oakiness."
2361,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Pearse Founder’s Choice 12 year old, 42%<review>Pearse Lyons Distillery opened in 2017, becoming Dublin’s second working distillery this century. This single malt has a nose of honey, apple pie with cream, light pepper, dried grasses, and green herbal notes. The orchard fruits of apple and pear are silenced by a fury of pepper, root ginger, and clove, with only grapefruit peel proffered in response. The dry, banana chip finish fades in a melee of squabbling spices. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)"
2362,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Broken Barrel Mizunara Blended American Whiskey, 50%<review>A blend of 5 year old Kentucky and 4 year old Indiana corn whiskeys, finished on mizunara oak staves using Broken Barrel’s proprietary process. The nose is unusual, with candied fruit, grape Kool-Aid, blueberries, fresh coconut shavings, Popsicle stick, and a grassy character. Muted tropical fruit vies with oak on the palate, which is silky; soon chile pepper and oak dominate. It finishes with peppery heat and sweet oak. (6,600 bottles)"
2363,"<price>47<rating>85<whiskey>Italian Single Malt Red, 40%<review>It might be Italian single malt, but it isn’t whisky. It’s getting there, though, and this is very sippable in its own right. This is from the far North of Italy, where the influence is heavily Austrian. It’s very well made indeed, is bursting with vibrant fruit, and is good enough now to be enjoyed as an aperitif. It will appeal to Italian palates, which are fond of very young spirits. €35"
2364,"<price>320<rating>91<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 1), 56.6%<review>Cranberry, watermelon, and cherry, with deeper notes of raisin and prune, are lanced by piercing spices. There’s a thick and heavy mouthfeel that begins with caramel and vanilla, sliding into chewy toffee with coffee notes and a hint of raspberry, though harried by peppery spices so sharp they taste spiky."
2365,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 16 year old, 43%<review>This has been Lagavulin’s principal expression for more than 30 years. Iodine, rich peat, and caramel on the early nose, with sherry, sea salt, and charcuterie. The oily, briny palate offers peat and a medicinal note, along with black tea, Seville orange, toffee, cinnamon, and a hint of smoked fish. Peat embers and hot tar in the lengthy, spicy finish. Deeply satisfying!"
2366,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Amrut 'Fusion,' 50%<review>Balance, complexity, and surprising maturity for its age -- these are the defining characteristics of the best Indian whisky I have ever tasted. Amrut is doing some great things, and this whisky just elevated them to a new level. Combining Indian malt and Scottish peated malt, this whisky shows a sweet side, but is never cloying, with rich caramel, vanilla custard, and fruit cocktail in light syrup, balanced by vibrant -- almost floral -- dried peat smoke, delicate white pepper, and a hint of tropical fruit (toasted coconut, pineapple). Soothing, lingering smoke finish. I look forward to more great whiskies from Amrut."
2367,"<price>53<rating>85<whiskey>Aultmore 12 year old, 55%<review>Aultmore is normally light and estery, and this pale dram is true to this. After a whiff of fresh turmeric, there’s an almost oily green note with William pear before acetone, and something akin to school Bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. The palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet, rounded, and more substantial that you expect, with tinned pears in custard. Lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose."
2368,"<price>115<rating>85<whiskey>Ledaig 18 year old, 46.3%<review>This 18 year old variant of Ledaig from Tobermory distillery on Mull was released in spring 2015 and is finished in oloroso sherry casks. Old warm leather predominates on the early nose, with salt, pencil shavings, a suggestion of asphalt, and dried fruit. Big fruit and spicy peat notes on the robust palate, which features sherry and a sprinkling of brine. Drying slowly, with licorice and marginally tannic oak behind persistent smoke."
2369,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>Grangestone 12 year old Highland single malt, 40%<review>The nose is inviting, with marzipan, malt, ripe bananas, milk chocolate, and cinnamon. Green fruit notes emerge later. Very sweet on the smooth palate, with bubble gum, satsumas, peaches, and delicate spice. The finish is medium to long and persistently sweet and fruity, with a hint of dark chocolate at the end. Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth."
2370,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Belle Meade Sour Mash Straight, 45.2%<review>A blend of high-rye bourbons (30% rye) aged 6 to 8 years. A warm, welcoming nose, with pleasant dunnage warehouse earthiness, toasted oak, maple syrup, cinnamon, blackberries, grape candy, licorice, and an herbal note. A racy palate offers candied citrus, cherry, and apricot, as well as bitter chocolate, caramel, cinnamon spice, and pepper. Light and delicate on the finish, with milk chocolate, almond, orange, and more cinnamon. Delicate, smooth, sweet, and balanced."

Spicy sherry, heather, and black coffee in the luxurious finish. €50"
2372,"<price>61<rating>91<whiskey>Four Roses Single Barrel, 59.4%<review>This is a 9 year old from the OBSF recipe. Brings to mind intense cinnamon over fruit, sprinkled on pumpkin bread, cooked in kettle popcorn, with a scone. Then there’s an explosion of caramel: crème brûlée, salted German chocolate cake, glazed doughnut holes, and caramel-drizzled baked peaches. Hints of smoke, ginger, tobacco, and clove. A delightfully long finish carries a hint of cinnamon for a must-have quaff. (Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive)"

ginger, and bright bubble gum. The palate is consistent, juxtaposing fruity
spirit—orange, lemon, strawberry, blueberry—with savory peat smoke. Vanilla, nuts,
black pepper, cinnamon, and well-integrated oak are also at play. The finish lingers
with the sweet-savory pleasure of a cigar, nutty oak, spice, and peat. Does well with
water, showing excellent development. (208 bottles)"
2374,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Loch Lomond 12 year old, 46%<review>Like its elder sibling, Loch Lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form, and in this case, matured in a mix of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe apricots, vanilla, and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  The full palate offers oranges and pears, plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. Long in the finish, with spicy fruit notes. Drying, with subtle tannins."
2375,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Glen Breton Rare, 43%<review>Unusually sweet and perfumed. Layers of malty sweetness (honey, butterscotch, caramel, vanilla wafers) is the dominant feature of this whisky, with background notes of almonds, toasted oak, and citrus fruit. Herbal, hay notes also emerge from time to time. This is not an overly complex whisky. It is also a tad fiery at times (alluding to its youthful age), but this whisky is an improvement over a previous sample I tasted from this distillery a year or two ago.

Not overly sweet and just slightly floral. Viscous and creamy, yet massive, muscular, and so beautifully complex, balanced, and integrated. (102 bottles; Canada exclusive) $225 CAD"
2377,"<price>101<rating>84<whiskey>Master of Malt Darkness! Benrinnes 15 year old Oloroso Cask Finish, 52.9%<review>What you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent, but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml"
2378,"<price>375<rating>92<whiskey>Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 55.6%<review>A special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. So nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. Silky smooth, velvety texture. Creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. Plenty of fruit, too (golden raisin, honeyed peach, ripe nectarine, hint of banana bread). Richly textured, good weight (but not cloying), and the flavors combine seamlessly. A celebratory whisky indeed."
2379,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Fukano 10 year old (2020 Release), 40.3%<review>
Peppercorns and aromatic spices ride over baked orange, toffee, and lemon peel. The spices are buzzing, like you’ve face-planted on a hornets’ nest, and it’s a blast: dry-roasted spice rubs, cumin, coriander seed, and some bitter blackened spice notes. In comparison, the palate feels like an anticlimax; mild and light, with lemon, honey, a Peppermint Pattie’s center, vanilla, fudge, and zested orange, with the spices reduced to a background hum. (7,077 bottles)"
2380,"<price>227<rating>90<whiskey>Penderyn Swansea City Single Cask, 59.7%<review>Penderyn quotes a respected writer on its website, saying that no one does port-influenced whisky better. This bottling certainly makes the claim. It was a single cask, but there have been others equally as impressive, and there will be more. This is brash, colorful, unsubtle, and a bit daft — so was comedian Tommy Cooper — but still unforgettable and easy to fall in love with.  256 bottles.  £146"
2381,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Oola Discourse Three Shores Whiskey, 47%<review>A blend of Highlands scotch, Canadian whisky, and house-made high-rye whiskey. Aromas of stewed red fruit, pomegranate, and mint hold promise, but the whiskey is quiet, with subtle peach, unripe raspberry, apricots, and white flowers. White chocolate, cornbread, and biscotti flavors add a good deal of sweetness. The finish is pleasant and rounded. An interesting experiment, but it’s hard to discern what each component brings to the table."
2382,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Cù Bòcan 2005 Vintage, 50%<review>The latest vintage expression of Tomatin’s peated Cù Bòcan was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Fishy smoke on the nose, with ripe red apples, toffee, milk chocolate, and malt. Creamy mouthfeel; ripe pears in peat smoke, sweet spices. White pepper, plain chocolate, and a lick of licorice in the relatively long and lively finish. (11,400 bottles)"
2383,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Blue Hanger 10th Blended Malt, 45.6%<review>With some powerhouse whiskies in the blend (including an '87 Bunnahabhain), it’s a surprise that the nose is so reserved, with citrus, ginger, and honey. On the palate you need your flavor shovel to unearth a core of typically strong flavors, including leather, oak, salt, dark chocolate, and even rancio. It’s delicious but highly elusive. The finish is medium and quite dry. What an odd blend. I haven’t had to work this hard for a blend in a long time. (U.S. only)"
2384,"<price>40<rating>79<whiskey>Old Pogue Master's Select, 45.5%<review>A bourbon with a gentle demeanor and easy drinkability.

2385,"<price>750<rating>95<whiskey>Brora 35 year old, 49.9%<review>Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) Editor's Choice"
2386,"<price>1230<rating>92<whiskey>The Dalmore Quintessence, 45%<review>Quintessence is the first single malt to have undergone secondary maturation in five different types of California red wine casks: zinfandel, pinot noir, syrah, merlot, and Cabernet Sauvignon. Sweet sherry, ripe cherries, marzipan, and white pepper on the nose. Rich and mouth-coating; strong flavor of thick-cut orange marmalade, oloroso sherry, malt, and milk chocolate. The finish features gentle warming spice and lingering Jaffa orange. Plain chocolate and orange notes seem as though they are never going to end! £1,000"
2387,"<price>499<rating>96<whiskey>Teeling Vintage Reserve Collection 24 year old, 46%<review>Wow—the nose is spellbinding. An exuberant mix of heavy fruit and deep sweetness: crème brûlée, vanilla pod, fruit syrups, sticky jam tarts, and apricot stone. Silken mouthfeel, with orange flan and brown sugar, growing increasingly tangy, with peppery spice rippling over the tongue and hints of smoke at the end. Oak char and marzipan fruits on the finish. The bar has been set high for Irish whiskey this year. (5,000 bottles)"
2388,"<price>37<rating>91<whiskey>Jameson Black Barrel, 40%<review>Sumptuously rich and intense whiskey emerges from these double-charred casks; a seduction of butterscotch, treacle, toasted nuts, scorched coconut, raisin, and vanilla essence. Secure in its deep-centered sweetness, it revels in caramelized sugar, dark vanilla, pecan nut slice, crème brûlée, peppery spice, and fleshy fruits gloomily submerged in sticky, umber syrups. Memorable for its long, satisfying, toasted aftertaste, heavy on the vanilla and raisins."
2389,"<price>80<rating>93<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof Rye (Batch 1), 61%<review>Redemption repeats their barrel-proof MGP-sourced 95% rye, now at 7 years old. Has a year significantly changed last year's 90-point outing? Oak is more subdued and the pepper floats on sweet, light caramel. It is still quite nice at full-bore, no water needed. Sweet vanilla and bitter rye oil blend surprisingly well; this is hitting the bells, and it's better integrated. Big, swaggering, and sporting big-barrel maturity. Can go toe-to-toe with almost any rye out there."
2390,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>Barrell 15 year old Cask-Strength Bourbon, 52.55%<review>A blend of straight bourbons at least 15 years old. A fragrant, complex nose of oak, baking spice, cherry pie, cooked pears, and bitter lemon, with underlying notes of cigar box and dunnage house floor. The palate is creamy and sweet, offering caramel, chocolate frosting, coconut shavings, a fruity note of sweet raspberry, and chili pepper. A finish of tobacco leaf, dark chocolate, and more spiciness as a final note."
2391,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Four Gate Outer Loop Orbit Orange Curaçao-Gin Cask-Finished Bourbon, 60.15%<review>A pleasantly oily nose, rich with botanical notes, orange peel, black licorice straps, herbs, vanilla frosting, and macaroons. The palate is sweet, with tropical notes of pineapple and mango, grapefruit, dried apricots, and gentle spice. A lengthy finish offers lemon cream pie, vanilla cream, light pepper, and tobacco, ending with a hint of bitter chocolate. A very unusual bourbon, divisive within our tasting panel, but also very unique, balanced, and flavorful."

Aged in a mix of Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks, this has a peppery, slightly savory nose, offering boiled sweets and dried fruits. The palate is voluptuous, with sherry, dates, caramel, dark spices, and oak tannins. Licorice and a suggestion of chile in the ultimately drying, lengthy, slightly meaty finish. (7,692 bottles)"
2393,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Glenfarclas 105, 60%<review>Brimming with distillery character. Gentle malty notes come through initially, accompanied by apple core and classic ‘Farclas weight. The alcohol, though high, is not obtrusive. In time there’s some orange marmalade, and this bittersweet element helps to add another layer of complexity. Water brings out toffeed depth. Even neat it isn’t too hot, showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended."
2394,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Tomintoul) 37 year old 1966 vintage, 43%<review>Fresh and lively for its age, with appetizing saltiness, citrus fruit (lemon, line and orange marmalade), and subtly complex dried spices. A fat, malty foundation complements these seasonings beautifully mid-palate, with the salt and dried spices emerging again on the finish. Very sophisticated.

Just 999 bottles have been released. Opens with slight saltiness on the nose, almost ozone, then lemons and pine, and finally, vanilla fudge. Overt citrus notes on the palate, with aniseed, some oak, brittle toffee, and a smokiness not found in younger Balblairs. The finish is long and discreetly spicy, notably cinnamon and black pepper."
2396,"<price>23<rating>87<whiskey>Old Tub Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>This is more about mashbill than barrel, a fine showcase of grain. Light and sweet on the nose, with peanuts, nougat, creamed corn, banana pudding, coconut cake, and Popsicle stick; water brings out fresh apple. It stays consistent on the palate, showcasing the purity and sweetness of the grain: cream, vanilla taffy, toasted coconut, and toasted wood. It finishes with peanuts, toasted coconut, clean grain, and oak."
2397,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Little Book Chapter 1 “The Easy,” 60.2%<review>By focusing exclusively on high-quality straight whiskeys, without neutral spirits, Little Book is a fine example of America’s new era of blends. It includes all straight whiskeys: 4 year old bourbon, 13 year old corn, 5 year old 100% malt, and 5 year old rye. Like Booker’s bourbon, Little Book is uncut and unfiltered, to preserve the full flavor. The dominant note, cornbread, still allows the malt’s sweetness and the rye’s spice to come through. This is the first release from Freddie Noe, son of Beam master distiller Fred Noe and grandson of the late Booker Noe himself. It’s an impressive and unconventional debut, as Freddie prepares to continue the Beam legacy. Number 11 in the 2017 Top 20 "
2398,"<price>133<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Stem Ginger Preserve (distilled at Mortlach) 1995, 46%<review>This is Mortlach in musing mode. An aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill, then opens into sweet spice, light syrup, with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant. Water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. Substantial and spicy. £85"
2399,"<price>162<rating>81<whiskey>Mackmyra Moments — Jord, 55.1%<review>This is the Mackmyra equivalent of an arena rock band playing a small town club gig; a raw, rough and ready, in your face rock and roll version of the whisky — and it’s not for the faint-hearted. Matured in French red wine casks, it has a pleasant apricot and woodsmoke nose, while the taste is young, brittle, and gristy, with intense and persistent pepper, ginger, and bitter berries. Well-made, but not the best starting point to explore Mackmyra. "
2400,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>anCnoc Rutter, 46%<review>Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm.

Ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish, with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. Full-bodied, with intense, sweet fruit notes on the palate, and a heathery, smoky kick. Smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200"

Gentle, pleasing oak finish. Nice dovetailing of flavors and very drinkable. A good example of a lighter-style mature blend, and quite the antithesis of the Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary bottling reviewed above. A pleasing warm weather scotch, or perhaps before dinner as an aperitif.

(Batch #18A23), 46%<review>High West made a momentous change to its recipe for Double Rye! this year, for the first time adding its own house-made pot still rye to a blend that was previously fully sourced from other distilleries. Apple blossom, yuzu, chamomile tea, walnut shells, pine boughs, and green-apple candy on the nose shift into an oily palate that starts off soft and then picks up speed and spice. Flavors of lemon, black pepper, walnut-and-apple chutney, dark chocolate, and a lively hit of green apple make this a satisfying pour—especially at the price. Above all, it validates High West’s skill as both blenders and distillers in their own right. Number 14 in the 2018 Top 20 "
2405,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Porter’s Small Batch Straight Rye, 45%<review>A tropical note of lime on the nose, as well as licorice and ginger root, offers youthful but balanced oak. The mouthfeel is creamy, with grapefruit and orange peel on the front palate melding into vanilla cream and underlying flavors of spice and pepper. The finish brings more citrus and creamy vanilla, along with cinnamon and drying oak. It seems young, but the profile is fresh and offers interesting flavors."
2406,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Century Reserve 21, 40%<review>Taken slow and easy, this 100% corn whisky tells a story, one you have to suss out gradually. It’s big and flavorful with hints of sweet corn, cow barn, and spices, followed by peppermint, lime peel, lilacs, and oak. Then it turns fresh, creamy, and alive with invigorating pepper and just a smidgen of sweetness, blending lemon drops, vanilla, and barley sugar until the story resolves satisfyingly on your palate. (Canada only) C$40"
2407,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman USA Small Batch No. 2, 48.5%<review>Buckets of fresh-picked berries, pastry cream, green banana, saline, and iodine peat on the nose. It stays consistent on the palate, with sweet berries, toasted baking spice, chocolate, salty and mineral peat, and a creamy texture. The flavor builds and then, on the finish, crescendos on a wave of dark chocolate, bittersweet oak, and smoldering peat smoke. The fruit doesn’t make it to the end, but there’s no lack of a sense of completion. (1,260 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2408,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Benromach 15 year old, 43%<review>The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style, and this shows how well owner Gordon & MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering."
2409,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Stranahan’s Sherry Cask Single Malt (Batch 004), 47%,<review>Finished in 500-liter oloroso sherry casks, this is one for the sherry lovers, with sugared almond, fig, milk chocolate, and candied fruit notes on the nose. The palate is rich, with milk chocolate Toblerone, grape soda, raspberry coulis, candied ginger, almonds, Fig Newtons, and drying oak. It finishes sweet and silky, with a hint of tobacco, vanilla, and delicate dried fruit."
2410,"<price>240<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Tamnavulin), 37 year old, 1967 vintage, 46.7%<review>Deep amber/chestnut/crimson color, suggesting a good dose of sherry cask aging, which the palate confirms. Syrupy notes of fruitcake, burnt fig, raisin, and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak, polished leather, roasted nuts, and dried spice on the finish. The 37 years of oak impact is balanced nicely by the sherry, even if both are a bit extreme for what is normally a more elegant dram. 
"
2411,"<price>101<rating>84<whiskey>Ci6 Elements of Islay (distilled at Caol Ila), 61.2%<review>Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. Vibrant, with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml"
2412,"<price>140<rating>89<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Balmenach) 1988, 55.6%<review>It’s a crying shame that this great distillery is so rarely seen. Here, a bourbon cask has reduced the meatiness and amplified the fruity component, but these are fruits with depth and power, allied to dried flowers. The mango-like sweetness is reduced to syrup; there’s light plum jam and some old paper. Sweet on the tongue, with crystallized ginger, apricot, and a finish of spice, and the strange sweetness of licorice root. (The Whisky Exchange only.) £84"
2413,"<price>110<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Premier Barrel (distilled at Talisker) 5 year old, 46%<review>Following a similarly youthful Provenance range bottling of Talisker, and an NAS “Young and Feisty” variant, Douglas Laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its Premier Barrel lineup, complete with ceramic decanter, 495 of which were produced. Initially meaty, then peat smoke envelops the nose, with damp tweed backing it up. Black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate; flinty, with lemon and lime. Lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finish. £75"
2414,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>W.L. Weller C.Y.P.B. Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 47.5%<review>Buffalo Trace asked fans to “Craft Your Perfect Bourbon” and this is the result. Cracker Jack and butterscotch sweetness appear on the nose, with cedary oak and black cherry soda lurking just beneath. On the palate, the flavors are bold, mouthwatering, and juicy, like dark berry fruit sprinkled with baking spices and spearmint. This has big impact, but is also delightfully drinkable, as the finish delivers citrus oil, stone fruit, and blackberry."
2415,"<price>350<rating>87<whiskey>Kujira 20 year old Ryukyu Japanese Rice Whisky, 43%<review>Toddy-like aromas of ginger and honey, along with vanilla bean, sugared pecans, cinnamon, allspice, apricot, and savory koji. The palate is sweet and fruity, a cup of Mott’s applesauce with drizzled honey and sprinkles of cinnamon. It finishes with more sweet apples, vanilla, and caramel. Water not recommended."
2416,"<price>45<rating>94<whiskey>George T. Stagg 2nd Edition, 71.35%<review>The first release of Stagg was our 'American Whiskey of the Year' for 2003. I couldn’t imagine this one being better, but it is. This is a textbook example of what older, more mature bourbon should taste like: great depth and maturity, yet nicely balanced without excessive woodiness on the palate. It is spicier and creamier on the nose than the first bottling with more vanilla tones and not quite as dry on the finish. Indeed, it hints of a softer, gentler side. But with a name like Stagg, it can be nothing more than a hint. Other flavors you’ll enjoy in this bourbon include spearmint, teaberry, candied fruit, leather, and toffee. Given its high proof and reasonable price, it’s also a great value. (Like Campbell’s soup, just add water.)"
2417,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Jefferson's Very Small Batch Bourbon, 41.15%<review>The whiskey’s formula has been improved, and now consists of a higher percentage of older whiskies (into the high teens) than the original release (which I rated 81). Nicely balanced, with candied fruit, blackberry jam, soft vanilla, kettle corn, and a kiss of mint. Pleasant, unpretentious, and uncomplicated."
2418,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Royal Brackla) 1975, 46%<review>Orange marmalade color. Aromas of ripe fruit (orange, strawberry, red raspberry), caramel, and toffee, with a subtle, Spanish oak resin spiciness. Medium to full in body with a silky texture. Nicely balanced on the palate and very well integrated flavors similar to the aromas. Silky smooth finish. 
"
2419,"<price>25<rating>92<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1995 Vintage (Barrel #1), 43.3%<review>This year’s 1995 Vintage is another delicious treat. It is one of the most richly textured bottlings of the past ten vintages and its flavors meld seamlessly, combining layers of creamy sweetness (chewy toffee, butterscotch, and a touch of corn), spice (mint, vanilla, cinnamon), polished oak, vibrant fruit, and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg."
2420,"<price>120<rating>88<whiskey>Navazos Palazzi Spanish Grain, 53.5%<review>A sultry, earthy, fragrant whisky, with black cherry, currants, dunnage warehouses, sherry, ground ginger, dry oak, and chili flakes. Warm and enticing, this displays great structure: black cherry, sultana, and dried fig; a middle phase of cavorting spices that are soothed into a lengthy finish of spicy, rich dried fruits. Plenty of sherry character makes this a delicious find, but it would be interesting to try a less cask-driven expression. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
2421,"<price>450<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Rare Auld (distilled at Girvan) 1974 40 year old, 53.7%<review>This is an assured release, one not trying to be anything other than beautiful old grain whisky. Caramel, aged oak, rose petals, and dried heather twigs, with touches of sweetness. The palate has a lovely substantial feel to it, the strength quite apparent, with soft sweet toffees, fleeting citrus and grapefruit, then aniseed tugging at your tongue. The finish is a gum-numbing, sweet decay of fading oaky memories. (78 bottles)"
2422,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Patriot’s Trail Bourbon, 42%<review>The rye spice on the nose is big, broad, and aromatic, with allspice and clove in the mix, but there are some distillation issues, with a slight rubber-tire note of feints. Rich and viscous on the palate, it’s slightly hot, but shows really lovely spice and toasted nuts, turning oak-dominated on the finish."
2423,"<price>90<rating>95<whiskey> William Larue Weller (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017), 64.1%<review>This is a work of art. It begins by revealing vanilla, from custard to cake icing. Then it speaks caramel with a dark chew, crème brûlée, and Werther’s Original hard candy. From here, complexity takes over, with candied popcorn, butterscotch, chocolate ganache, French toast, maple, honey, pumpkin pie, fried pie dough, blueberries, and cinnamon, with hints of molasses and pecan. The long finish seems to offer a concentration of all the flavors. Delicious. Editor's Choice."
2424,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Jura 10 year old, 40%<review>This is the first release in the distillery’s new core range for the U.S. After primary maturation in bourbon barrels, the 10 year old whisky undergoes a sherry cask finish. Orange marmalade, pine nuts, white pepper, and very subtle smokiness on the nose. The palate majors in overripe Jaffa oranges, ginger, and milk chocolate. The milk chocolate darkens in the medium-length finish, with coffee grounds and warming spice."
2425,"<price>20<rating>80<whiskey>Centennial, 40%<review>The nose is slow to open up, and when it does it reveals simple rye spices and butterscotch. These become primary flavor notes on tasting. Biting spices burst onto a buttery palate before a pleasing bitterness seeps in. The second sip seems almost nutty and sweet, with pralines and thick cream. This 10 year old blend of all-wheat and rye-grain whiskies is simple, but displays its age with such subtleties as fading orange water and woodsy herbal notes. (Canada only) C$25"
2426,"<price>300<rating>89<whiskey>Yamazaki Sherry Cask (2016 Edition), 48%<review>I tried this alongside the ‘legendary’ 2013 which, while good, remains too tannic for me. This though, has refinement and some complexity, with roasted tea, scented wood, resin, new brogues, and then the fruity Yamazaki undertow. In time you’ll get perfumed, incense-like sherried elements. It’s the finish where things take off into rose petal, strawberry, and Yamazaki’s pineapple signature. Water increases the tannin. Better than 2013, but still only for sherry bomb and tannin lovers."
2427,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Balcones Single Barrel French Oak Single Malt (Barrel #15974), 64%<review>The nose shows glorious maturity, with tropical fruits, blueberry, concord grape jelly, and pineapple soda, all mingled with wood spice, dried chile, and smoked meat. Excellent consistency into the palate, which benefits from water to tame oak tannins; juicy pineapple, guava, papaya, jackfruit, and hibiscus tea brighten up cocoa powder and chile flavors. It finishes floral and fruity, with persistent chili, chocolate, and cigar notes. Multilayered and rewarding."
2428,"<price>47<rating>80<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, 14 year old, Coarse Grain Oak, 45%<review>Aged in fast-growth wood. Quite the antithesis of the “Fine Grain Oak” release above; the comparison is interesting. Darker fruit (plum, blackberry), and darker sugars (maple syrup, toffee). Resinous and becoming quickly dry on the palate, with leather, tobacco leaves, grape-stem tannins, barrel char, and dried spice. A heavier, more textural bourbon than the Fine Grain Oak expression. I like this whiskey a lot until the dry, leathery oak notes begin to dominate the latter half of the palate. That, my friend, is the coarse grain oak in action."
2429,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Hudson Manhattan Rye Whiskey, 46%<review>Hot nose, plenty of rye spice — it is 100% rye — mint, bay leaf, sweet clove. Quite a kick, but there's good flavor behind it; more spice, oak, and a firm sweetness. The finish is quite quick, just some dry rye in the back of the mouth, and gone. Better-behaved than most Hudson whiskeys I've had; hardly mellow, but enjoyable. Price per 375 ml."
2430,"<price>48<rating>79<whiskey>Douglas Laing Single Minded (distilled at Jura) 8 year old, 41.5%<review>Bottled as part of Douglas Laing’s Single Minded range, which focuses on young small batch bottlings, this 8 year old Jura matured in two refill sherry butts after being distilled in April 2006. Pear drops, pine nuts, and damp woodland on the nose. The palate is light and fruity, though dark spices and aniseed soon emerge. Peppery oak in the dry finish. £33"
2431,"<price>15<rating>83<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Sharp nose, a bit of heat, fresh ground/cracked spices—cinnamon, pepper, allspice—and hot sugar about to caramelize. There’s nothing soft here. The first crash on the tongue isn’t soft either; it’s rushing bonded heat, insistent pepper, and dry oak. Wait a bit, and it calms as you finally find the corn and the mouth widens, then slides into a dryer, lasting finish. Pretty wild ride for a wheated bourbon."
2432,"<price>500<rating>93<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1975 vintage, 43%<review>A polished, very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine, peach, nectarine, kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon, white pepper, anise), creamy vanilla, and almond evolve on the palate, leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages, I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality, with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars, more weight, and more roasted nuts. 
"
2433,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Wild Scotsman (distilled at Mortlach), 1994 vintage, 13 year old, 46%<review>This whisky shows the true potential of Mortlach -- and at a youthful age, too! Quite fragrant and very complex on the nose and palate. Chewy toffee with almonds, vanilla fudge, ripe barley, and nougat, with underlying pit fruits, dried spice, and a hint of leather on the finish. Very fulfilling."
2434,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Cask Strength 2005 (distilled at Caol Ila), 57.3%<review>Aged in first-fill sherry butts, this cask strength vintage from Gordon & MacPhail features a nose which opens with savory ginger, becoming more fragrant, plus vanilla, fudge, and warm leather. Oily in the mouth, with ripe cherries, sweet spices, pipe tobacco, and new leather. Nutty and slightly earthy. Citrus fruit, dry spicy peat, and black pepper in the finish."
2435,"<price>215<rating>91<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Dimensions (distilled at Cambus) 1991 26 year old, 50.5%<review>Waxy lemon, light honey, lychee, physalis, fresh hay, and the slightly tart aroma of ripening pear. On the palate, the pear is honeyed and ripe, awash with a lovely citrus sweetness, before a brief spasm of bitterness as the peppercorn and clove spices move in. Perfect drinking at this strength, it ends with a tart, dried-fruit note on a bed of spice."
2436,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Seven Stills Chocasmoke, 47%<review>Distilled from an oatmeal stout with a shot of peat, this intrigued even before the cap popped. It does smell like an oatmeal stout: cocoa, grains, fresh bread, restrained smoke, mixed with small-barrel oak. The smoke blows up in the mouth, much more evident, and the chocolaty, honey-sweet base rolls underneath…but it’s shallow, without the richness of a properly-aged scotch. Craft whiskeys want to grow up so fast, but this is like a kid in his dad’s clothes. (400 bottles only) Price is per 375 ml."
2437,"<price>155<rating>81<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Bowmore) 15 year old 1999 (cask #350), 54.2%<review>Nosing this whisky, you'd never guess just how fruity it is, with barnyard hay, dry malt, honey, and light smoke. On the palate, however, the fruit is unmistakable with giant mango and apple. The mid-palate takes a sharp left turn into smoke and salt, but the mango just won't let go. A very dry, smoky finish is too dry, making the case against release at this ABV. An oddball whisky that will probably only appeal to a very narrow audience. (U.S. only)"
2438,"<price>128<rating>89<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988, 57.9%<review>This example is more assertive than the Strathclyde 1987 (see below), but with a better defined grain character. Peeled plum skins, Christmas spices, and honey. Well-balanced yet intense, it feels packed with potential. Warming, with dried orange peel, a big wave of ginger, spice, dried apple, and mango ensure sufficient sweetness to swamp the acidic tendencies of the citrus. The spices rattle around the mouth for some considerable time, colliding with the dry citrus. (198 bottles) £89"
2439,"<price>104<rating>90<whiskey>Navazos Palazzi Overseas Malt Single Sherry Cask, 52.5%<review>Although distilled in Scotland, this completed its maturation in Spain; it’s not scotch, but it is very tasty. Cocoa powder, melted milk chocolate, ground hazelnut, vanilla pod, snuff, and allspice go full tilt at cask strength. Chocolate fondant pudding, baked fruit, cocoa, malt, dried fig, black pepper, and black fruits operate with a dark, tangy edge that ignites the tongue. This has been bottled at a perfect strength. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
2440,"<price>65<rating>81<whiskey>Chicago Distilling Blind Tiger Bourbon, 45%<review>Fresh oak nose, with hard candies and bitter grass notes. Much less oaky on the tongue, but the hard candies—spicy-sweet, a bit hot—burst in the mouth, leading down to a warm, pastry-sweet finish with a wreathing of ashes. Boozy and warm, and a bit simple, but quite drinkable for a young bourbon."
2441,"<price>13<rating>88<whiskey>Carlyle, 40%<review>This noble Scot consists of a blend of 20 different whiskies and impresses with its nose of hazelnut, dark chocolate, vanilla pod, menthol, peppercorn, and wisps of damp wood smoke. Warm chocolate fudge, mellow spices, dark burnished orange, smooth oak, old leather, and malted milk. The mouthfeel is weighty enough to sustain the heavyweight flavors. Long finish of dark rum, cocoa, and spiced chocolate. Just add your own favorite leather armchair. Value pick."
2442,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Chicken Cock Ryeteous Blonde, 45%<review>A nose of cinnamon-sugar and citrus leads to flavors of orange gumdrop, tangerine,
and sweet tea. The body is quite light and quickly succumbs to drying spices and a
finish of bitter tea leaves. Passable, but just not a lot to see here. (1,428 bottles)"
2443,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Hillrock Single Malt (Barrel No. 4), 43%<review>Razor-sharp aromas of clove, seasoned wood, and dried grass push firmly out of the glass. Hard-edged grain and spice continue on the palate, but without the harshness you might expect from young whiskey with such a bold nose. It softens toward the finish and becomes sweeter, with a hint of buttery fudge, then develops an oaky dryness at the end. Impressive young whiskey."
2444,"<price>60<rating>81<whiskey>The Singleton of Glendullan Classic, 40%<review>Glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. Any whisky with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in English-speaking markets. It’s a shame, because it’s always delivered a gentle, sweet, lightly fruity/estery style, making it an ideal lunchtime dram. This ticks all those boxes. Green apples are there, as is cinnamon, alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. The finish is short, but it does its job as an easy-drinking, everyday malt. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
2445,"<price>14999<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Grant 50 year old, 54.4%<review>Deep ruby with a yellow rim. Clearly mature, and heavily sherried. A highly concentrated nose: Marmite and soy sauce, and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. Drinkwise, it’s closest to Chinato: curative barks, dried herbs (mint, hyssop, oregano). The palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky, but the tannins aren't overly astringent, and there remains a sweet core still, even if the overall effect is dark. It’s not obviously Glen Grant, but it is a fascinating glass."
2446,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Kentucky Peerless 4 year old Small Batch Barrel-Proof Straight Rye (#R150420204), 54.85%<review>A nicely layered nose reveals cocoa, fruit, nougat, nuts, and spice in abundance. The dark chocolate envelops the fruit like chocolate-covered blueberries, while the warming spice evokes fresh-baked gingerbread cookies, with traces of paraffin wax hinting at maturity. The rich palate is noticeably hot, but water treats it well, and is necessary to fully unleash the confectionary notes of Jordan almonds and root beer barrels candy as persistent vanilla and cherry coulis ride to the pepper-laced finish that’s long and expressive with drying oak."
2447,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Te Bheag Blended Whisky, 40%<review>Pronounced “Te Veg,” this has its roots in the Isle of Skye, and as there’s only one distillery there it’s highly likely that the odd
drop of Talisker has found its way into the mix. Whether it has or not, this is stirring stuff, non-chill filtered so that the flavors burst forth. As you might expect, it’s rugged with brine and chili, giving it a distinctive spice edge. But the delivery is a caramel fudge delight, with luxury chocolate praline in there too."
2448,"<price>101<rating>91<whiskey>Box The Festival 2014, 53.5%<review>Disgorge bourbon quarter-casks after 3 years and fill them into sixteen virgin American oak 40-liter casks that have been made from air-seasoned wood, medium toasted then charred, and what do you get? Maple syrup, pecan pie nuttiness, piercing vanilla, fluffy cotton candy, and the char note of the dome of a well-fired fruitcake. The palate chews through nut brittle, butterscotch, praline, nutmeg, baked banana, and active wood spices, with the sweetness of a good bourbon. Respect. (700 bottles) 889 SEK"
2449,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Pikesville Straight Rye, 55%<review>Heaven Hill’s 80-proof standard Pikesville is a summer favorite, so I was eager to try this. A woody depth to it at 6 years old: 110 proof-hot, stewed plum and horehound candy, and sizzling rye spice behind it. It's a jawbreaker: full and hot in the mouth, with sweet grassy spice, bitter rye grain as it progresses, and crackling sugar near the end, just before it all smooths into a savory layered finish. Exciting ride, great ending."
2450,"<price>25899<rating>92<whiskey>Talisker Prima & Ultima 31 year old 1988, 51.4%<review>Fresh fruits and white pepper on the nose, with brine and rock pools. Very little
smokiness. The palate is also fruit forward—ripe red apples and pears—with barley
sugar. The peat is now much more apparent, along with prickly spice. Mildly
medicinal. Salt and black pepper in the long finish. Price is for entire Prima & Ultima
Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (721 bottles) £20,000"
2451,"<price>50<rating>76<whiskey>Rabbit Hole, 47.5%<review>With a mashbill of 70% corn, 10% malted wheat, 10% malted barley, and 10% honey malted barley, youth is evident, as ripe grains and wood initially dominate. Pepper, cherry, and raw clover honey appear mid-palate over wheat bread and creamed corn. A surprisingly medium-to-long finish gives a hint of caramel, suggesting more time in the barrel would create a better pour."
2452,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Hotel Tango Bravo Bourbon, 45%<review>Fresh wood, pine forest, and grassy meadow greet you on the nose—followed by lemon, coriander, and some warmer notes of ginger and shortbread. The palate is sweet, with chocolate, caramel, hints of almond, licorice, cinnamon, and clove, balanced against notes of anise, pine nuts, dill, and black pepper. The finish is punctuated by polished oak and spiced chocolate. This craft expression is youthful, but is also dynamic and complex."
2453,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Mackmyra Special No. 9, 46.1%<review>Mackmyra continues to play a far more sophisticated game than it is given credit for, releasing pleasant and easy drinking mainstream malts, and then packing a punch with one-off oddball single casks. So this is an utter delight and among the very best Mackmyras released. Vanilla, banana, sweet jellybeans, and some toffee all playing Mr. Hyde. Dr. Jekyll pops up with earthy salt notes. Medical gauze and pepper for a savory finale."
2454,"<price>6000<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfarclas 50 year old 1955 vintage, 44.4%<review>The oldest whisky ever bottled by Glenfarclas. Fortunately, Glenfarclas ages very nicely. This whisky proves my point. It is very complex, with notes of burnished leather, roasted nuts, fruit cake, toffee apples, sultana, damp peat, and sappy oak. A very soothing whisky, with the depth and maturity one hopes for in a whisky this old. Only 110 bottles produced and only 18 destined for the U.S."
2455,"<price>329<rating>91<whiskey>Cutty Sark Tam o' Shanter 25 year old, 46.5%<review>In my opinion Cutty Sark 25 year old is one of the great blends, so a new version was always going to be a big ask. This one comes with a lot of packaging, so is it a victory for style over substance? Not at all. This is all about big flavors; burnt orange, juicy raisin, and dark chocolate; rich oak and exotic spice. A treat, and worthy of its heritage. But at that price—and bearing in mind it's a limited edition—are you going to open it? "
2456,"<price>124<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 27 year old 1988, 62.6%<review>Buttery croissants, golden honey, peach stone, rye cracker bread, royal icing, vanilla essence, and dry oak. It’s sweet and sticky with icing sugar and yellow fruits before a scorching alcohol burn kicks in, lasting 30 seconds. It settles down to banana custard and vanilla, becoming tangy with candied peel, Turkish delight, and Edinburgh rock. The gum-tingling finish evaporates quickly. Careful—water disables the flavors all too easily, though adds some toasty spice and warmth. (192 bottles) £96"
2457,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Sea Fog American Whiskey, 45%<review>This whiskey portrays its coastal origin with a lovely sea-air quality that vies for attention with brown sugar, beeswax, and delicate smoke notes. Gentle peatiness weaves through the cocoa-tinged honeyed malt on the palate, culminating in a smoldering finish, where the mouthwatering saltiness seals the deal. Nicely integrated and well balanced, with fine pot still character. A single malt of pale and peated malts, aged 7 years in bourbon barrels."
2458,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s 10 year old, 40%<review>A highlight of the Basil Hayden’s line for its cherry cough drop and clove-studded orange flavors that nicely match sweet fruit with spice. There is some intriguing earthiness—suggestions of a mushroom-covered tree stump. The light-bodied palate delivers modest apricot, peppery oak, and vanilla, with sandalwood on the finish. Very nice flavors, just a bit timid."
2459,"<price>73<rating>85<whiskey>Cù Bòcan Limited Edition Virgin Oak, 46%<review>Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt, and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks, this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose, with lemon, lanolin, vanilla, poached pears, and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate, zesty and warming, with apple pie, and caramel. The finish is medium in length, with spiced fresh oak. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50"
2460,"<price>80<rating>83<whiskey>Arran St. Emilion Wine Cask Finish (Limited Edition), 50%<review>Rich, good body, blueberry muffin, black cherry, a lot of tannic grip (perhaps a little too much for balance). Not as polished as the Pomerol or Madeira."
2461,"<price>99<rating>94<whiskey>George T. Stagg 15 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon (2019 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 58.45%<review>Aromas of concord grape jelly, vanilla crumb cake, dusty baking spice, leather, tobacco barn, iced tea, and peanut shells are offset by citrus peel and rose oil, especially prominent with a bit of water added. The bold, rich palate is packed with dark berries, baking spice, semi-sweet chocolate, and espresso, with pops of citrus fruit and spearmint adding liveliness and verve. It finishes with blackberry cobbler, dark chocolate, leathery oak, and undercurrents of black pepper and baking spice that don’t quit. Restrained and elegant, even at full proof."
2462,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Kurayoshi 8 year old, 46%<review>Heady with spring blossoms, mixed peel, cantaloupe, green banana, and taffy candy, with a fine thread of spices running through it. A hesitant opening, it wallows in gentle apple and orange before a strong tangerine streak appears, the mouthfeel becoming weightier, drawing through flavors of peppery herbal salad leaves and vanilla cream. The spices take the lead from then on, the fruit fading quickly in the peppery afterglow. (1,440 bottles)"
2463,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Nikka From The Barrel, 51.4%<review>A high-strength blend that takes no prisoners. The color is full gold and the first thing that hits the nose is a complex mix of restrained smoke (sandalwood, cigar), fennel, and celery before semi-dried tropical fruits and orange peel take over. The palate also shows some of that mango character, but also crisp oak and a burst of sweet powdered spices on the finish. A malt-lover’s blend."
2464,"<price>150<rating>93<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Clynelish) 1986, 46%<review>Deep gold color. Fresh, exciting, spicy aroma of brine, exotic pepper, seaweed, and raw fruit, with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. Full-bodied and muscular. Flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. Salty, peppery, intense finish. 
"
2465,"<price>66<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Mortlach) 8 year old, 46%<review>Very pale straw. The color indicates that there’s been no real cask activity. A little closed on the nose to start; clean, quite green and leafy (young ferns). The flavor however, makes up for this, with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle. Of interest to completists. £45"
2466,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2016 (distilled 2010), 46%<review>The annual (albeit limited) Loch Gorm release allows you to chart Kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. Here, first-fill and refill sherry casks (oloroso to be precise) were used. The latter seem to have more of a say, as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit, marine smoke, and clementine, before the golden raisin from the cask develops. The palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. A bolder style, but very well balanced. Limited, so get in there ASAP."
2467,"<price>270<rating>87<whiskey>Royal Brackla 21 year old, 40%<review>As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish."
2468,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Tullibardine The Murray Marsala Cask Finish, 46%<review>After initial maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels, this 2006 vintage from Tullibardine was transferred into marsala wine casks for a year of finishing. The nose offers vanilla, ginger, printer’s ink, red wine, plums, milk chocolate, and walnuts. Rich red-berry fruit flavors on the palate—raspberries and cream—plus coffee and cloves. Black treacle and dark chocolate in the slightly earthy finish. Accomplished."
2469,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>The Tyrconnell, 14 year old, Cask #3179, 46%<review>Tropical in nature, with pineapple, coconut, and kiwi. Additional notes of vanilla, caramel, new-mown hay, and light marzipan. Creamy on the palate throughout. A lovely whiskey, but the two finished versions above have it beat."
2470,"<price>55<rating>92<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 70.3%<review>These Stagg releases are becoming legendary. This one, while not the best of the bottlings, maintains the Stagg reputation. When compared with the earlier release in 2005, this Stagg expresses a shade less oak. It’s also more subtle and creamier on the palate. It’s clean, superbly balanced, and very drinkable-even at higher strengths. Light toffee, maple syrup, and caramel corn provide a bed of sweetness. Layered on top are notes of candied fruit, crisp mint, vanilla, and polished oak. Soft finish. Just don’t add too much water to it because the flavors seem to lose their cohesiveness at lower strengths. Drink this whiskey at a strength higher than you normally would to fully appreciate it."
2471,"<price>120<rating>93<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage 10 year old Heavy Char Kentucky Straight, 60%<review>
Sweet, almost candied notes pervade the nose: brown sugar, maraschino cherries, Cherry Coke, strawberry Twizzlers, peanuts, and baking spice. Candied dark fruit leads the palate, with semi-sweet chocolate and nuts behind it; spice starts out soft and builds into the finish, where it blooms into harmony with full-bodied oak, coffee bean, and baking chocolate. Delicious with or without water."
2472,"<price>114<rating>89<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 16 year old, 55.6%<review>Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus, even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke, paprika, then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across, showing maturity, balance, and no rubberiness. In time, there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Whisky Show but still commercially available. £75"
2473,"<price>125<rating>93<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. 8 year old Journey Cask Collection Britannia Single Malt, 64.6%<review>Smoked almonds, marzipan, fig-studded chocolate, vanilla sugar, and flan on the nose—quite sweet and dessert-like, but grounded in earthy char. Robust, full-bodied, and almost juicy with flavor, it shows red fruit, almonds, figs, dark chocolate, flan, black pepper, and cigar ash on the palate, finishing with more ash, oak, and dark fruit—so carefully structured it might well have been designed on a blueprint. Distilled by The English Whisky Co. and bottled by Virginia Distillery Co. (243 bottles)"
2474,"<price>13<rating>82<whiskey>J.T.S. Brown, 50%<review>Despite the common Heaven Hill origin, this is not the same stuff as Dant. The nose is focused, dry, integrated: sweet corn, the inside of an old wooden drawer, and a flip of sweet spice. Lively in the mouth, almost playfully light: corn fritters and filigreed oak. If you mix this, go light; this is not a heavy bonded trooper. One cube, a small splash; then enjoy the delicacy."
2475,"<price>144<rating>78<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (Batch 2), 43.1%<review>Caramel wafers, white pepper, pumice stone, and strands of caramel on the nose, but this is not a whisky bursting with personality. A sip brings cocoa and chocolate flavors which meld into an herb garden bouquet. A thin mouthfeel and rather linear flavor development make this seem rather ordinary, not a word I normally associate with this idiosyncratic range. The finish is redolent of marble cake. Not a patch on the superb Batch 1 in my book. (415 bottles) £100"
2476,"<price>599<rating>93<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1972 (Cask #3551), 44.7%<review>Dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (U.S. exclusive)."
2477,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Cragganmore Distillers Edition, 1992 vintage, 40%<review>Matured in port casks. The standard Cragganmore 12 year old is one of Scotland’s best kept secrets-I enjoy its incredibly complex, dry, spicy character. The port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup, golden raisins, mandarin, glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. Still, for this, the whisky sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. A fair trade-off, though. 
"
2478,"<price>60<rating>81<whiskey>FEW Single Malt, 46.5%<review>Fresh and distinctly grain driven, like slurping warm breakfast cereal, but that malt purity also comes at the expense of complexity and development, with lots of grassy meadow, cut hay notes, that lead to a palate of husky grain and honeyed malt, before a finish sweet, young grass notes."
2479,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Big Bottom Whiskey Port Cask Finish Batch #2 3 year old, 45.5%<review>A relatively high rye grain content for a bourbon (36%). The port adds richness (fleshy fruit) and helps the whiskey taste older than it really is (by masking some of its youthfulness?). Notes of ripe cherry, soft plum, mandarin orange in syrup, dates, and toffee. The spices (cinnamon, mint, and a dusting of cocoa) pick up mid-palate and finish strong and warming. A slight bit more port than I would prefer, but the spice vibrancy still shines through. "
2480,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Ohishi Islay Cask-Finished Rice Whisky, 42.8%<review>Sweet honey, pears, melon, and vanilla sponge, with smoke that is both sweet and acrid and cuts through like a knife. Islay knows that delicious combination of sweetness, fruitiness, and smoke very well, and this could be amazing with a firmer, weightier texture. Flavors of watermelon, taffy, squeezed lime, and candied pineapple, with the smoke and meek spices growing in strength, adding smoked chocolate notes before a short finish. (5,000 bottles)"
2481,"<price>110<rating>85<whiskey>Oban 1999 Montilla Fino Finish Distillers Edition, 43%<review>This vintage edition of Oban was distilled in 1999 and finished in montilla fino sherry casks, which lend a greater richness and complexity to the Oban house style without detracting from its essential characteristics. It was bottled in 2014. The nose is fragrant, with musky pineapple, and salted caramel. Silky on the palate, with Seville oranges, ginger nuts, and cloves, plus a faint suggestion of brine. Persistent orange and dry spice notes in the oaky, medium-length finish. £75"
2482,"<price>119<rating>81<whiskey>New Zealand South Island 21 year old, 40%<review>The Doublewood experiment highlighted above may be the way forward for what's left of this old New Zealand stock, because having tasted several samples now, and presumably the better ones, there's a pattern emerging. The core whisky is fine, with tangy lemon and earthy pepper, but the casks clearly weren't great and they throw up inconsistencies. This is fine as far as it goes—until you see the price tag. This is $120 in American dollars. Nor is it as good as the Rugby World Cup 16 year old Vindication bottling.  NZ$148"
2483,"<price>230<rating>89<whiskey>Scott Selection 1973 (distilled at Macallan), 50.9%<review>Deep gold color. Fragrant, floral aroma, with a potpourri of dried spices, especially vanilla and nutmeg. Creamy texture. Flavors of creamy vanilla and caramel, becoming dry with subtle spices and just a hint of fruit."
2484,"<price>85<rating>90<whiskey>Remus Repeal Reserve Straight Bourbon (Series III), 50%<review>This is autumn in a glass, like jumping into a pile of dried leaves. Notes of sassafras and shredded chewing tobacco lead to aromas of spiced baked apple studded with cloves and sprinkled with cinnamon. Water really ramps up vanilla, delivering a burst of fizzy cream soda. The palate offers maple syrup sweetness, orchard fruit, root beer, and spices balanced by leathery oak tannins, before a long finish of chocolate, nougat, and candle wax."
2485,"<price>125<rating>81<whiskey>Longrow, Gaja Borolo Finish, 7 year old, 55.8%<review>Grape candy, raisin, blueberries, vanilla malt, and lavender, with hints of lemon and spearmint. More aggressive campfire embers and damp earth burn underneath, along with some salt. A whisky that grows on you, and not bad for 7 years old.
"
2486,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie Sonnalta PX, 46%<review>The first of Glenmorangie’s new “Private Collection” line of whiskies for Travel Retail. This one is finished in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry. With PX being so rich and intense, and Glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate, does the sherry dominate here? No, it doesn’t. Still, this is viscous and very textural for a Glenmorangie. I’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot, toffee almond, chocolate-covered raisin, glazed citrus, and cherry pits, all leading to a leathery, tobacco-tinged finish. A visceral whisky with plenty of grip. Great for after dinner."
2487,"<price>155<rating>90<whiskey>Glengoyne Christmas Cask, 60.6%<review>Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery. The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. This is clean, pure, and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next."
2488,"<price>56<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg 10 year old, 46%<review>Classic ‘southern shores’ Islay from the onset: salty and medicinal on the nose, with smoked haddock, citrus fruits, and milk chocolate. The palate yields full-on hot peat, pipe tobacco, black coffee, licorice, and more chocolate. The finish is long and malty, with sweet smoke. Non-chill filtered."
2489,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Oregon Spirit Straight Bourbon (Barrel Series No. 150317), 47%<review>The nose is dark and roasty: clay, dried leaves, walnut and pecan shells, cacao nibs, dried chiles, tobacco leaf, and darjeeling tea, as well as hints of tropical fruit. Full-bodied and oak-driven on the palate, with spiced tea-leaf complexity highlighted by tobacco leaf, cinnamon, clove, allspice, black pepper, mint oil, chocolate, and roasted corn. Continued chocolate, oak, and spice into the finish, interwoven with cigar wrapper and pops of licorice and mint."
2490,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>Monkey Shoulder, 43%<review>Never more than an arm’s length away from most bartenders, this blended malt, launched in 2005, has been a game changer. Bottled at a higher strength, this has fresh green apples, buttercream, lime, and kumquat, with a fresh acidic tartness, butterscotch, crushed peppercorn, and dried chili flakes. Dark toffee, Brazil nut, chocolate, peppery spices, and toasted oak on the palate. Lively finish of spice and chocolate toffee. Best Value"
2491,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>The Irishman 12 year old Single Malt, 43%<review>An aperitif-style aged Irish whiskey which plays in harmony with the fresh American oak bourbon casks. A light, fragrant nose of spring blossoms, waxed lemons, cinnamon sticks, pears in golden syrup, marshmallows, and fresh laundry. There is decent weight and structure here. Sharp acidity of peel scattered over lemon meringue pie, cinnamon, black pepper, and a finish of creamy fudge dipped in milk chocolate. Water pries open a hitherto-hidden waxy consistency (6,000 bottles released)"
2492,"<price>33<rating>78<whiskey>Last Mountain, 40%<review>While their home-distilled whisky matures, some dedicated craft whisky makers hone their blending skills using sourced whiskies to create blends such as this one. Caramel heated to the point of burning, and oily, freshly-roasted coffee with hints of real maple syrup gloriously overtake a spirity nose that betrays the youth of this simple, no age statement work in progress. Scrumptious elements of clean oak, burned lumber, sawdust, and earthy pineyness are beguiling, but would benefit from tighter balance. (Saskatchewan only.) C$33"
2493,"<price>76<rating>90<whiskey>Scallywag Cask Strength, 53.6%<review>As if this cheeky devil from Douglas Laing wasn’t good enough already! Strawberry napoleon, mint leaves rubbed between finger and thumb, runny honey, fresh peach, and wood whittled on the back porch. The sweet orange starts gossamer light, then it hits the gas: the citrus becomes more tangy, touching blood orange, fizzy sweeties become taffy candy, then sherbet. Eventually pacified, it becomes milky and sweet, with milk chocolate melting on the tongue. A creamy finish like a mother’s embrace. £50"
2494,"<price>20<rating>90<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s Triple Barrel Rye, 45%<review>Begins light on the nose with clean grain, then spring flowers and persistent, strong blackberry notes move in. Wonderfully balanced, even as blackberries remain strong across the palate, accented by tart kiwi fruit and rich spices: ginger, cloves, nutmeg. Fruits and spices complement each other as the round, creamy palate fades into a long, hot, peppery finish. Beautiful whisky exclusive to the U.S., and fruitier than the 43.4% Canadian version. Best Value"
2495,"<price>34<rating>87<whiskey>Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Red Cask, 40%<review>If you close your eyes, the first whiff will carry you into a shoe store with its clean leather and vague, sweet, waxy polishes. A beautifully constructed, fruity, creamy, full-bodied whisky that shows hints of dry cereal, ripe red fruit, orange liqueur, and early on, something vaguely like grape tannins. Clean sparkling peppers enhance the lush fruits, while almost citrus-like barrel notes cleanse the palate with their slightly pulling, oaky finish. Very tasty. (Canada only) $45 CAD"
2496,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Bruichladdich Sherry Edition Manzanilla 1998 vintage, 46%<review>The fresher of the two, with appetizing brine, honey, lemon rock candy, golden raisin, and peach. Subtle ginger, toasted marshmallow, and coconut round out the palate. Very bright and lively."
2497,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>High West Valley Tan (Batch #2), 42%<review>High West has a second version of Valley Tan. The “Utah oat whiskey” was distilled to 87.5% (about the same proof as single pot still Irish, and technically a “light whiskey”), aged 2 to 4 years in new and used cooperage. A light golden color; nose is somewhat spicy, with a licorice/peppermint tinge and some alcohol heat. It's quite smooth, almost Irish in its drinkability, with grainy notes graced with that light peppermint and biscuit sweetness. Pleasant sipper indeed."
2498,"<price>113<rating>88<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Miltonduff) 20 year old, 51.5%<review>Pale gold. Lightly floral and perfumed. The impression of honey on warm buttered scones. As it opens, so this gentle complexity grows, and gives a sense of some substance. Water reveals a hint of malt, fruit syrups, and pear blossom. The palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant, and a hint of marzipan. A classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. Don’t. £74"
2499,"<price>95<rating>93<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2012 Release), 54.3%<review>Elegant, clean, and peppered with dried spice notes throughout (cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice). Additional notes of barrel char, vanilla wafer, summer fruits, caramel corn, maple syrup, and candied almond add complexity. Begins sweet, but dries out nicely on the finish, inviting another sip. Very nice! "
2500,"<price>55<rating>91<whiskey>Wood’s 2 year old Alpine Rye (Batch 16), 49%<review>From Colorado-based Wood’s High Mountain Distillery. A nose of apple, brown sugar, and blackcurrant, set against jalapeño spice and smoke. The palate offers flavors of cinnamon and burnt espresso beans, with an alluring smoky bitterness and notes of jalapeño, smoked chiles, and black pepper. On the finish, dried dark fruits and bitter chocolate emerge, with a blast of pepper at the end. Rich, brawny, and assertive, but also supple and well integrated."
2501,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>George Dickel Distillery Reserve 17 year old, 43.5%<review>Tennessee whiskey shall not be undersold in this flavorful version. Rich notes of caramel and vanilla developing in yellow cake batter with dark caramel, brown sugar, leather, toasted pecans, and hints of walnut, smoked apple, and honey. Then red fruit, baking spice, and complex butterscotch over a palate-coating mouthfeel that’s perfectly warm and balanced all over. As good as it is, it could be better with ten more proof points. Its light proof shows in a shorter-than-desired finish. (Tennessee only) 375ml"
2502,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old (bottled Spring 2012), 45%<review>Usually the least talked-about in the Antique Collection, but in my opinion certainly of the same caliber. This year’s release proves my point: nutty toffee and rummy molasses notes balanced nicely with dried fruit, cinnamon, polished oak, subtle leather, and tobacco. The oak is kept in check for such an age, and all the flavors work well together. Nicely done!"
2503,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Twice Barreled, 12 year old, 45%<review>Placed in a new barrel after 8 years and 8 months. Very spicy with an oak sappiness. Loads of maple syrup and corn sweetness up front, with the spice and some subtle lush fruit kicking in mid-palate. Leather and tobacco follow through to a very masculine, dry oak finish. While a very enjoyable whiskey, the dominant, hot, and lingering oak on the finish keeps me from scoring it as high as its siblings. 
"
2504,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Bib & Tucker Bourbon, 46%<review>Mild and mellow nose of corn and oak, with a bit of warehouse reek, and a light, cleanly earthy note. Smooth and sweet in the mouth, with sweet cornmeal and sunny meadowgrass, a touch of candied cinnamon. A very friendly and easy-going bourbon, not too young, not too old. Sourced whiskey."
2505,"<price>61<rating>85<whiskey>Jura Turas-Mara, 42%<review>Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, Jura Turas-Mara takes its name from the Gaelic for “long journey.” It has been matured in an array of casks sourced from America, Spain, France, and Portugal. Initially, green apples on the nose, then sweet fruit notes—jelly babies—plus coconut and fudge. A little linseed in the background. Vanilla, peaches, mango, and lively spices on the palate. The finish dries, with aniseed balls, becoming slightly powdery. €50"
2506,"<price>273<rating>81<whiskey>Fary Lochan Efterår Batch #01, 48%<review>This 3 year old whisky comes from Denmark’s smallest distillery, where Jens-Erik Jørgensen has invested in a bulbous pot still from Forsyths, Scotland. I found barley sugar, mashing malt, risen loaves, vanilla, and fruity esters reminiscent of boiled sweets. The warming flavors begin with orange candies and clove, but it bucks like a wild stallion before settling to divulge a hint of licorice and cayenne pepper. A dry and sudden finish. Promising, but needs time to mellow. €200"
2507,"<price>250<rating>91<whiskey>Glenfiddich Winter Storm 21 year old, 43%<review>Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series continues with this expression, finished for up to 6 months in ice wine casks sourced from Peller Estates winery in Ontario, Canada. Concentrated aromas of canned peaches in syrup, vanilla, and clotted cream. Silky on the palate, with a carryover of peaches from the nose and succulent blood oranges. The finish is medium in length, slowly drying, but fruity to the end. (7,800 bottles in U.S.)"
2508,"<price>156<rating>90<whiskey>The English Single Cask Rum Cask (No. 0471), 57.8%<review>A heavily peated whisky finished in a single rum cask. Very smoky with a lot of heat, but a balanced depth. Quite meaty on the palate. Heather honey, supple leather, English peppercorn sauce, and salted vanilla wafers, with incense hanging in the air. Charred apple skins and red berry fruit keep this from being out of balance. Boysenberry, lavender, and smoke on the finish. Very forceful, but complex and intriguing. If beefeaters didn’t already have a drink, they’d probably drink this. (360 bottles; U.S. only)"
2509,"<price>38<rating>87<whiskey>Chicken Cock Heritage Reserve, 45%<review>A light and sweet bourbon, with butterscotch candy, toasted coconut, lemon curd, marshmallow, and a bit of chalkiness on the nose. The palate is floral, tending toward cedar and sandalwood perfume, with marzipan, milk chocolate, and orange. It finishes with hookah tobacco, toasted oak, and almonds."
2510,"<price>289<rating>90<whiskey>Berry Brothers & Rudd (distilled at Glen Grant) 1972 37 year old, 51.8%<review>This is quite different from the Adelphi Glen Grant bottling (below), being more cask-driven, but Glen Grant’s clean fruitiness remains, although transformed by age. Its apples are baked, with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel, and light, sweet spice. The waxiness here is akin to leather oil, while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. In time, there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. Delicious, and best neat. £184"
2511,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>McKenzie Bourbon, 45.5%<review>Sharpish nose, hot corn, peppermint, a bit of grape, and underlying cocoa. Sweet mouthful of vanilla and corn, the cocoa's here, and some oakspice. Finish is a bit rough and hot, but not unpleasant. This works better than the sherry-assisted takeoff of their rye whiskey. Could be more rounded, but it's well-constructed and solid."
2512,"<price>102<rating>90<whiskey>Millstone PX, 46%<review>This is from Dutch distiller Zuidam and it's the third exceptional bottling in a row. The PX here refers to the Pedro Ximenez cask used in maturation and this is almost liqueur-like, with plummy fruits, gooseberry, damson jam, and overripe plum. But there's lots going on here on top, with a dusting of cocoa, some perfumey notes, and a sniff of pepper. The jam keeps fighting back though, and there's apricot in there at the end. €75"
2513,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Balblair 1990 (2nd release), 46%<review>The oldest of Bablair’s current core bottlings was distilled in 1990, and after maturing for 21 years in bourbon casks it was transferred to oloroso sherry butts for a further 2 years prior to bottling. Citrus fruits, furniture polish, cloves, cinnamon, and parma violets on the nose. A silky mouthfeel, spicy, with dark berries, dates, and rich sherry. Slowly drying, with aniseed and dark chocolate in the finish."
2514,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. Courage & Conviction American Single Malt (George G. Moore Batch), 46%<review>The official debut of the distillery’s 100% own-make single malt. The nose has an earthy expression of the grain, and works in heady aromas of guava, pomegranate, blueberries, and kiwi, along with sandalwood soap. It’s oily and silky in the mouth, with forthright lemon and orange oil, guava, and kiwi, as well as dried leaves, nutty tobacco, and peppery spice. The finish is gentle and fades slowly, with lemon oil, milk chocolate, and a hint of ashy charred nuts. (9,600 bottles)"
2515,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Amrut 7 year old Single Grain Single Cask (No. 1431), 57.1%<review>Clean and sweet on the nose, with confectionary aromas of vanilla, coconut, lemon curd, shortbread, and almond halva; there’s also concentrated orchard fruit, milk chocolate, and jasmine. It’s dry and chewy on the palate, with plenty to enjoy—spiced plums, raspberries, incense, milk chocolate—though the complexity flattens out into the finish, which is sweet with vanilla custard, milk chocolate, fresh raspberries, and lingering floral notes. (108 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2516,"<price>29<rating>84<whiskey>Forty Creek Cream, 17%<review>Quite a bit darker than most other whisky creams. Chocolate and caramel—on the burnt side, an interesting difference—in the nose, with a sly hint of whisky behind it. Sweet and creamy, a bit clingy, with just a sting of whisky.  Somewhat generic, though, because that interesting dark caramel is in the nose only, and I’d like this to be a bit more distinctive; more Forty Creek. Still pleasant enough for booze candy! C$29 "
2517,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>The Balvenie Caribbean Rum Cask 14 year old, 43%<review>A new addition to the permanent Balvenie range. Lovely bright gold color. Layers of sweetness (the characteristic Balvenie honey, along with vanilla fudge, nougat, and rich toffee) peppered with dried spice and a hint of tropical fruit (papaya, guava, tangerine). Nice viscosity with good grip on the finish. I really like the balance and complexity of this whisky. A very solid effort and the price is right."
2518,"<price>800<rating>94<whiskey>The Balvenie Vintage Cask 1976 vintage, 53%<review>Very spicy and complex, with incredible depth. Once again, this 30-plus year old whisky proves the aging ability of Balvenie. Still quite vibrant and invigorating for such maturity. The classic Balvenie honey note is there, but more reserved, along with graham cracker, vanilla wafer, citrus peel, raspberry (red and black), nectarine, and polished oak. Long, spicy finish. Another outstanding Balvenie Vintage Cask. Although, I look at the price and remember how shocked I was when the Balvenie vintages were selling for $400."
2519,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Auchentoshan Classic, 40%<review>Light and clean, with citrus, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe banana), white chocolate, and honeyed vanilla, resting on a clean malty foundation. Soft on the finish. An easy-going whisky."
2520,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>The Lakes The One Port Cask-Finished, 46.6%<review>

Tawny and ruby port casks have robed this whisky in fantastic colors, and on the nose, there are baked cherries, blueberry muffin, sloes, caramel, and mild spice notes to enjoy. The palate swirls with sweet caramel, cola candy, bitter orange, plum, damson, and peppercorn, before hitting its stride with creamy vanilla toffee, baked apple, and fruit syrup flavors, and ending with a satisfying return of spice on the finish.£48"
2521,"<price>23<rating>86<whiskey>Jim Beam Distiller’s Cut, 50%<review>Cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey, followed by hints of paprika, fruits, flowers, and caramel. Afterward, it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls, caramel chews, vanilla cupcakes, and ginger. Baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice. It’s well-suited for mixing."
2522,"<price>63<rating>92<whiskey>Drumshanbo, 43%<review>
This phenomenal debut is one of the best new single pot still whiskeys around. Caramel, brioche, satsuma, dried apricot, aromatic spices, canned pears, and spiced apple peelings. The palate is creamy, lively, and fruity with pear, apple, dried citrus, lime, fresh plum, and toasted coconut, accompanied by a formidable pot still spiciness. With the inclusion of Irish barra oats and the balance of sherry and bourbon characteristics, this is masterful. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
2523,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>High West A Midwinter Nights Dram (Act 4, Scene 5), 49.3%<review>A blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Gobs of fruit (red and black raspberry, plum, dried citrus) and crisp mint on a bed of caramel and vanilla. Lingering cinnamon and fruit on the finish. Distinctive and impressive."
2524,"<price>500<rating>87<whiskey>Laphroaig 40 year old, 42.4%<review>Amber copper color. Very mature aroma of oak, damp earth, peat smoke, licorice, soft citrus, and seaweed. Full-bodied and somewhat oily. A gently sweet vanilla note up front-albeit very briefly-then a quick flash of citrus fruit and seaweed. After that it's a battle between peat smoke and oak, with the oak ultimately winning. Very long, dry, smoky finish."
2525,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch Wine Cask, 40%,<review>Blender Aimée Gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. The blueberry, blackcurrant, and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote, raspberry, strawberry, and lingonberry with light spices. A late resurgence of dark toffee, chocolate, and cigar smoke blow into the finish. Sip away by all means, but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long, cool drinks."
2526,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 15 year old, 43%<review>To fully understand this new offering, let me offer a little Knappogue Castle background. The first few vintages of Knappogue (not counting the original 1951 vintage, which was from the B. Daly distillery) were from Ireland's Cooley distillery--including 1990, 1991, and 1992. Then the whiskeys were sourced from Bushmills. The 15 year old, reviewed below, is from the original Cooley stocks. Consider it an encore performance. Knappogue Castle’s first non-vintage, and the oldest since the original 1951 vintage release. The whisky is from three different vintages -- 1990, 1991, and 1992 -- which were married together. I am pleased to see an older expression, because I have always felt that the previous releases, generally 10 years old or less, needed a little more time to blossom. Sweeter notes of peaches and cream, pineapple upside-down cake, banana bread, and vanilla wafer are balanced by a spicy, resinous dry finish. A textural whisky that coats the palate. My favorite of the post-1951 vintage Knappogues."
2527,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>BenRiach 10 year old Curiositas, 46%<review>Introduced in 2004, Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach. It has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. Mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose, hot road tar, honey, and light tropical fruit aromas. Iodine and smoky peat on the palate, with mineral notes, dried fruits, allspice, and oak. More oak in the medium-length finish, with peanut and peppery peat."
2528,"<price>60<rating>83<whiskey>Kilchoman Machir Bay 2013 Release, 46%<review>This year’s bottling mixes 4 and 5 year old bourbon casks with the younger element finished in oloroso, though this is hardly sherried. Here is smoke, samphire, and Kilchoman’s fleshy core giving echoes of 80s cuisine: scallops and white peaches anyone? Watering shows sea-washed rock, light flowers, and hot sand. The palate is sweet, sour, and smoky, with a chalky edge and a peppery palate, but water releases blossom and a little gunsmoke: a duel in the dunes? £39"
2529,"<price>111<rating>90<whiskey>Teeling 14 year old Brabazon Series 3, 49.5%<review>Sourcing Pedro Ximénez casks used since 1918 at a bodega in Jerez, Teeling left this
whiskey to finish for 3 years. A bouquet of sweet red apple, black grape, dried fruits,
and blueberry, with sweet roasted cashews, dry spices, and a slight herbal edge. Blue
fruits, plum, cinnamon, and bitter chocolate are harried ferociously by spicy
peppercorn, leaving a finish of bruised orchard fruit. Add water and the fruit really
shines. (10,000 bottles) €95"
2530,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Barrel Strength Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel 19C472), 54.9%<review>Complex and complete, the sweet and chewy aromas of maple syrup and crème de marrons meet milk chocolate and Andes Mints. On the palate, the intense layered sweetness of vanilla, crème brûlée, pecan pie, butterscotch, and honey is tempered by chili spice and deep earthy notes of leather and tobacco, before toffee and baking spices carry into the long finish."
2531,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Tommyrotter Triple Barrel American Whiskey, 46%<review>Aromas of menthol, licorice, and herbs have a slightly antiseptic quality, yet the caramelized oak and grilled pineapple flavors keep it grounded in bourbon. Bold and intriguing on the palate, it pours a bit hot, with lots of cedar shingle and sandalwood balanced by banana and toasted marshmallow. Cinnamon and candied orange on the finish. A blend of Indiana bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys finished in red wine casks."
2532,"<price>230<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Heathery Smoke (distilled at Caol Ila) 30 year old, 46%<review>Sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you, with fleshy, lychee-like fruits
behind. The smoke here is very polite, giving way to fruit jelly cubes and
peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak, with
the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.
Fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains
understated. Caol Ila basking in the summer sun. (U.S. only)"
2533,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>High West Bourye Blend of Straight Whiskeys (Batch 19L06), 46%<review>A nose of herbs, candied oranges, cherries, treacle, and baking spice, with pleasant aged accents of leather armchair and earthy warehouse floor. The palate offers semi-sweet chocolate, spice, dark fruit, roasted pecans, blackberries, cola, and pepper. Water brings out richer chocolate, pistachio, and blackberry jam. The finish is nutty, spicy, and peppery, with balanced oak and light fruit. Excellent complexity, with spice melding well with notes of chocolate and fruit. (60,000 bottles)"
2534,"<price>135<rating>91<whiskey>Springbank Local Barley 16 year old, 54.3%<review>The first of five annual releases of Local Barley from Springbank. This practice revives a concept discontinued in 2001. The barley in question was grown at Low Machrimore Farm in the south of the Kintyre peninsula and was distilled in September 1999. Barley, damp earth, sea salt, and citrus fruits on the lightly peated nose. The buttery palate yields spicy peat, orchard fruits, and more earthiness, closing with smoky lemon."
2535,"<price>37<rating>78<whiskey>Red Fife Batch 1, 50%<review>The heritage grains movement influenced distiller Jesse Razaqpur at Toronto distillery to make whisky from an old-time Ontario variety called Red Fife. This hard red wheat contains less starch than the traditional soft wheat used for whisky making, yielding less spirit. Red Fife wheat also contains flavor-inducing anthocyanins, similar to red-grape flavenoids. Distinctive grain dust and slate-like mineral notes dominate the nose, translating into searing hot pepper, ripe red fruit, and a slight sourness on the palate. (Distillery only) C$40/375 ml."
2536,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Revival, 46%<review>A combination of first-fill and refill bourbon casks was employed for maturation, followed by 6 months of finishing in first-fill oloroso sherry butts. The nose proclaims youthfulness, with metallic notes and a hint of yeast, but the sherry casks provide walnut, old leather, tobacco, and orange. Sherry, freshly planed wood, white pepper, and red currants on the palate. Plums dipped in sherry on the finish."
2537,"<price>35<rating>90<whiskey>Shackleton, 40%<review>One hundred ten years after the Nimrod expedition, blender Richard Paterson’s adventurous marriage of over 20 Highland malts brings fresh green fruits, manuka honey, vanilla, banana muffin, cantaloupe, fresh herbs, spice, and a wisp of smoke. Refreshing palate of green melon, light honey, vanilla, cinnamon, cooked apple, and gooseberry, becoming sour. More complexity on the finish: spice, smoke, cooked fruits, and chalky Sweethearts candies. Pair with mature prosciutto."
2538,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Frey Ranch Straight Bourbon (Batch 1), 45%<review>Certainly one for the oak lover, the nose is dominated by fresh lumber, dusty floorboard, and toasty wood notes, with sweet vanilla, hazelnut, cedar, and dark berry buried beneath. The palate is similarly oak-driven, with grape skins, tea leaves, and robust wood tannins leading to a finish that is dry and somewhat austere, with bitter chocolate and modest spice flavors."
2539,"<price>147<rating>80<whiskey>Braunstein Library Collection 13-2, 46%<review>The Braunstein craft distillery and brewery lies southwest of Copenhagen at Køge Harbor. This one uses barley peated to a phenolic content of 60 ppm and boy, do you know it! Any balance of character is resoundingly bested by acrid aromas of charcoal sticks, sooty fireplaces, and blackened toast. The oily mouthfeel oozes cherry soda, bubblegum, maraschino, Ama’r Stang, and Band-Aids, with chicory on the finish. This needs better balance; at present, it’s like a pyroclastic cloud erupting from the glass. 795kr"
2540,"<price>150<rating>81<whiskey>Old Blowhard 26 year old, 45.35%<review>The most intense of the Orphan Barrel initial release.  Very robust, with leather, tobacco, and roasted nuts. Quite spicy and resinous too. Toffee, maple syrup, and caramel struggle to soothe all this robustness, but the oak maintains the upper hand.  A digestif, perhaps, after a large meal? Unless you are purchasing for a piece of bourbon history, my advice would be to try it before you buy because, while complex, it is also quite woody."
2541,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut Madeira Finish, 50%<review>This limited edition is quite a color: deep orange with beautiful rose tints. Quite vinous on the nose, with orange peel, crème brûlée, honey, toasted coconut, grated chocolate, and preserved lemons all benefiting from the higher bottling strength. It’s darkly sweet with piquant plums, juicy raisins, sweet shortbread, fig, chocolate, honeyed lemons, and tangy candied peel. Truly excellent, the spice dominating the dark fruits and chocolate throughout the finish. (4,800 bottles)"
2542,"<price>38<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Distiller's Select Rye, 45.2%<review>Distilled from a relatively low-rye mash of 53% rye, 33% corn, 14% malt; true to Woodford Reserve form, a mingling of whiskeys distilled at Woodford and at Brown-Forman in Louisville. Nose of leather, cinnamon, rye snappiness, and hints of red raspberry. Hot and lean on the palate, spicy/sweet until rye’s bitter layering floats in, making for a dry finish as the oak comes on stronger. Balances drinkable and elegant quite nicely, and it’s real Woodford."
2543,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac Rye, 18 year old, 45%<review>This was my second lowest rated whiskey from the 2009 Collection (a 91 rating). This one is an impressive whiskey, and an improvement from last year. It’s soft (for a straight rye), well rounded, and easy to embrace, with tamed spice (cinnamon, mint, vanilla, mocha), nougat, toffee, fruit (bramble, subtle citrus), subtle date, and polished leather on the finish. Buffalo Trace is playing a shell game with this aged rye (being stored in stainless steel tanks over the past several years until new stocks mature), but in this instance there seems to be a prize under every shell. Well done! (Editor's Choice)"
2544,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Forty Creek John's Private Cask No. 1, 40%<review>Burnt sugar, wet raisins, oakspice, and a deep, underlying grain character. Flavors are wonderfully integrated: corn, malt, mellow syrup, hints of ripe plum and grape, wrapped in a light confection. Finish is light, warm, and lingering. Forty Creek releases a limited edition whisky every fall; this one focuses on grains rather than wood, according to distiller John Hall. Canadian distribution only."
2545,"<price>353<rating>86<whiskey>Talisker 25 year old, 45.8%<review>Previously only available as part of Diageo’s annual Special Releases program, and now bottled at the classic Talisker strength of 45.8%, instead of cask strength. Initially salty, then sweet and spicy on the nose, with summer berries, heather honey, and an earthy note, plus subtle peat. Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate, with licorice, aniseed, and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length, peppery, and relatively tannic. £225 "
2546,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Cask #3, 46%<review>Luscious sweet maltiness underlies a breadth of flavor that belies this whisky’s youth. Hints of acetone, green fruit, and hard pears joust playfully with earthy tones and elements of blue clay. Vague references to mulled red wine center around fleeting cinnamon sticks, ripe red fruit, and the grainy bitterness of buckwheat honey. Rich in grain and grasses, the palate is sweet, oily, and very spicy. Bottling at 46% and not chill filtering should please the anoraks. (Distillery only.) C$70"
2547,"<price>150<rating>88<whiskey>GlenAllachie 18 year old, 46%<review>Aged in American oak, Pedro Ximénez, and oloroso casks. The nose is nutty, with treacle, and developing geranium aromas. Prunes and dates, plus almonds on the buttery palate. Drying in the finish, with nutmeg and wood spice. (1,200 bottles for U.S.)"
2548,"<price>112<rating>87<whiskey>Yamazaki Puncheon, 48%<review>Yamazaki’s puncheons contain 480 liters and are made at the distillery’s cooperage from American white oak. The greater size means there are lower levels of oak extract, immediately apparent in the paler hue and more restrained aromas, where flowers mix with the gentle blandness of pear, lychee and, with water, pineapple. Best neat, here is distillery character (or one of the distillery characters, Yamazaki makes many styles) to the fore. Less immediate than the bourbon barrel, but ultimately more rewarding. £70"
2549,"<price>170<rating>87<whiskey>Rittenhouse Rye, 23 year old, Barrel #8, 50%<review>The follow up to the 21 year old expression reviewed a year or two ago. I prefer the 21 year old (which I scored a 92) over this 23 year old. While a dynamic, entertaining rye whiskey of massive structure (toffee, maple syrup, pancake batter, and Play Doh leading to leather, tobacco, oak resin, mint, and cinnamon), its age starts to show towards the finish, becoming dry and a bit ornery."
2550,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Exclusive Malts Speyside 10 year old 2004, 57.7%<review>This cask strength, port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near Aberlour. The impact of the port cask is unmistakable, with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot, blackberry jam, honey, and malt. On the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper, clove, salt, honey, and a touch of dark chocolate. The underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (U.S. only)"
2551,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Rock Oyster Sherry Edition, 46.8%<review>The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey, this rocks."
2552,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Daviess County Cabernet Sauvignon Cask-Finished Bourbon, 48%<review>A nose of mint and red and blue fruits suggests teaberry, with crushed herbs adding savory appeal. On the palate, the fruit really leaps forward; decadent black plum and red Hawaiian Punch turn ever-more dark and deep, as raisin and currants meet distinctive clove and cinnamon-spice notes for a finish of Christmas cake. Unconventional, but lovely in the way it combines lush sherried fruit with rye-like spice."
2553,"<price>55<rating>82<whiskey>Mackmyra Bruckswhisky, 41.2%<review>This may well be the perfect entry level Mackmyra. It has a lower strength, and is almost Mackmyra Lite, thinner and less peaky, peppery, and peaty than every other Mackmyra bottling. There’s a green fruit, almost gooseberry dimension to this; most unusual for the distillery, and the peaty underlay is fractured and dusty rather than sharp and intense. A revelation, and proof that the distillery is branching out. "
2554,"<price>13<rating>80<whiskey>MacQueen’s 3 year old, 40%<review>MacQueen’s has an impressive range of age statement blends, but this is the youngest one. Faint caramel and toast, a mild rub of whole spice, and snuff tobacco. The mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge, but little sweetness. More caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry, quick finish. There are better options around, even at this price."
2555,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Springbank 14 year old Amontillado Cask (#305), 55.4%<review>A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed, there’s a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish. "
2556,"<price>140<rating>91<whiskey>Bowmore Vault Edition Atlantic Sea Salt (First Release), 51.5%<review>This is the first of four bottlings in the Vault Edition series and was matured in bourbon barrels in the distillery’s famous No.1 Vaults. Nectarines in brine on the nose, with iodine and sweet spices. Medium-bodied on the palate, with peaches, vanilla, salt, and slightly bitter orange. Lingering orange notes in the finish, with cocoa powder and lots of salt. This expression lives up to its name!"
2557,"<price>23<rating>78<whiskey>Ridgemont Reserve 1792 8 year old, 46.85%<review>Barton’s entry into the premium, small batch bourbon category is a heavy hitter indeed. There are flavors of toffee, leather, and resinous spices throughout, with some background notes of fruit (especially figs and dates) and a dusting of cocoa. This is a full, richly textured bourbon. Its aroma is lovely and everything is working well on the palate, too-until about mid-palate, where it becomes very woody, assertive, out of balance, and quite dry all the way through its finish, to the point of becoming excessive. Otherwise, this would be a great whiskey."
2558,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Hibiki Japanese Harmony, 43%<review>Poised and complex, with typically lifted fruitiness: strawberry ice cream, pineapple, peach, balanced by delicate oak, bamboo shoot-like delicacy, then lemon. The palate is more rounded than that very forward nose, with toffee notes adding some weight. A touch of smoke comes along in the mid-palate, before fruits and caramelized coffee biscuits. Water allows the flavors to flood the palate. Exemplary blending skills and classically Hibiki."
2559,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 12 year old Linkwood 2007 Single Cask (Cask No. 804447), 55.8%<review>The nose is rich but not heavy, showing applesauce, poached pears, grape jelly, raisin scones, nutty dark chocolate, and a hint of orange. Zingy with citrus oil, especially lemon, on the palate, though that’s tempered by oak, raisins, toasted nuts, dark chocolate, and leather. It finishes with more nuts, coffee bean, pipe tobacco, and persistent lemon oil; a final note of poached pear recalls the nose. Elegant. (246 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2560,"<price>3500<rating>93<whiskey>The Macallan 50 year old, 43%<review>Amber-chestnut color. Aromas are very mature and so thick, one almost needs a knife to cut it. Notes of dried fruit (orange, lemons, pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove), with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick, enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There’s plenty of dried fruit, enticing wood spices, and peat to keep the palate entertained, all the way through to its very long, dry finish."
2561,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Treaty Oak Ghost Hill Texas, 47.5%<review>Fruity and fresh, there are aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, honeydew, underripe bananas, and floral notes—a garden in bloom. The palate retains freshness with herbaceous flavors of parsley and cucumber, as well as melon, licorice, white pepper, and a pop of cumin. Oak, pepper, licorice, and bouquet garni on the finish. Unconventional but enjoyable flavors, driven by the still."
2562,"<price>85<rating>80<whiskey>White Oak Akashi 5 year old, 45%<review>The Eigashima distillery, on the Akashi Strait near Kobe, may be the least well known of Japan’s single malt plants, but has a sound claim to be the country’s oldest, as its license to make whisky was granted in 1919 — four years before Yamazaki was built. It has, however, specialized in shochu, and even now only turns its hand to whisky making for two months every year. This 5 year old — bottled for independent Japanese specialist Number One Drinks — represents a tentative move into the single malt market once more. Pale in color, it shows a typically Japanese cleanliness on the nose that’s cut with a touch of waxiness. It opens with a scented angelica-like lift, there’s even a whiff of something like gooseberry jam. As it opens, the aroma darkens slightly, showing a touch of roasted tea. Water brings out a little yeastiness (typical for some younger whiskies), alongside cucumber, borage, and lime. The palate is sweet with vanilla custard and a sweet, ginger-accented note leading to ripe pear.
A charming malt, and already well-balanced for its age. Here’s Japan at its lightest. £55. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
2563,"<price>50<rating>77<whiskey>The One, 40%<review>Lakes distillery will become the fifth English whisky producer when it starts distilling this year. That puts England on the whisky map. Before then, though, this is its first bottling: a blend of British whiskies, though I'm not sure what that means exactly. The nose is fine, but on the palate it's like skiing on end-of-season snow: you get to ski, but it's a thin, wet, and not totally comfortable ride. England expects…better. £30
"
2564,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Bruichladdich Full Strength 1989 vintage 13 years old, 57.1%<review>Aged in used bourbon barrels. A fresh, appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper, with an underlying foundation of vanilla, barley, and grassy/hay-like notes. A very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. Very clean and straight-forward, with an appetizing finish. A whisky aperitif?"
2565,"<price>160<rating>85<whiskey>Cadenhead’s Indian Corn 26 year old, 58.3%<review>Like many older corn whiskies, this one unfolds slowly. Strong Cadbury caramel bar and slightly meaty, with sour fruits and cedar on the nose. Sweet and hot, with floral notes and initially a discordant touch of perfume. Pulling tannins provide structure for glowing pepper, sultanas, sweet spring flowers, some earthiness, and a touch of wet slate. Not as woody as most whiskies this age; a testament to long maturation in used barrels. (Cadenhead’s exclusive, Great Britain and Europe) £128"
2566,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Glengarioch, 21 year old, 43%<review>Amber gold color. Surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes, roasted nuts, tobacco, and malty sweetness in the background. Firm body. Delicious flavors of toasted oak, roasted nuts, smoke, leather, and malt. The flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. Satisfying finish. 
"
2567,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Yamazaki 18 year old, 43%<review>Deep, mature in nature, and very complex. Notes of polished leather, maple syrup, and dark pit fruit, with suggestions of tobacco smoke, wood shavings, and unsweetened chocolate. References to fine old bourbon and ultra-matured pot-still rum provide intrigue. Proof that Japan produces some outstanding, distinctive whiskies. Nicely done!

2568,"<price>28<rating>80<whiskey>Manatawny Still Works J. Potts, 47%<review>Unaged spirit, and smells like it: rich grain, a bit of loose-cut funkiness. Quite sweet in the mouth, more body than usual. Some oiliness, hints of cocoa and pastry, and a hint of something like bamboo shoots. Not as clean as some unaged spirit...but not as dull as some, either."
2569,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Grinsell’s Wood, 58.3%<review>Virgin Irish oak-finished Midleton single pot still whiskeys aged from 15 to 22 years take pot still into exciting new territory. The native pot still spiciness is enveloped by chocolate-covered honeycomb, toasty oak, spotty bananas, and a barista’s coffee scoop, though a dash of water picks out lemongrass and rubbed mint. A silky smooth mouthfeel of succulent fruits is shaken down with cocoa powder. Black currant squares up as heavy pot incarnate. Clove-spiked stewed apple weighs into a lengthy finish."
2570,"<price>62<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Cambus) 24 year old, 49.7%<review>Nearly a quarter of a century since Cambus Distillery closed, select casks are still being bottled by the independents. Grapefruit peel, fruit teas, lemon zest, mixed spice, cardamom, and wild garlic make for an intriguing nose. A sweet taste of sugared almonds, lemon bonbons, strands of candied peel, bananas, and vanilla, before the spices stomp all over the sweetness. Hot, dry, spicy finish with just a lick of butterscotch."
2571,"<price>38<rating>90<whiskey>Ballantine’s 7 Bourbon Finish, 40%<review>With a heart of Glenburgie, its bourbon barrel finish delivers a heady hit of vanilla, red apples, and brown sugar sweetness on the nose, with support from baked hazelnut cookies and ground black pepper. Toffee apple, pear, vanilla, salted caramel, and a gentle pepperiness dissipate to reveal caramel, heather honey, pecan pie, cocoa, and dark chocolate. Try this with orange or cocoa bitters in your next Old Fashioned. £28"
2572,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Old Ripy, 52%<review>Straw color and extremely light in aromatics, this whiskey starts earthy and goes spicy, with Hatch chili, allspice, and jalapeño cornbread leading the way. Then the sweeter side kicks in, with powdered sugar donuts, caramel chew, and vanilla latte coming through. Spice takes over toward the finish line in a hefty, medium finish. Perfect for cocktails. Price is per 375 ml."
2573,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Hazelburn 8 year old, 46%<review>Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. Sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish. "
2574,"<price>140<rating>88<whiskey>Ben Nevis 15 year old 1998 (Cask #590), 57.3%<review>This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92"
2575,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Scotia 10 year old Peated, 50%<review>Sweet peat on the early nose, with pineapple, toffee apples, and coconut. Slightly savory, with wood fire ashes. Somewhat oily on the palate, where sweet peat begins to dry, along with oranges, apricots, and marshmallows. The finish is relatively long, with vanilla and fresh oak dipped in hot tar."
2576,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Caol Ila 12 year old, 43%<review>Funny to think how recently Caol Ila was an Islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. These days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s Mr. Consistent. This version shows its character the best, a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. The peatiness isn’t dominant, but flows throughout the palate, scenting, lifting, and subtly changing the mix. A delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky."
2577,"<price>110<rating>85<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 2005, 57.2%<review>Initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat."
2578,"<price>82<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Tarlogan, 43%<review>Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. A hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose, then toffee apples, malt, and vanilla kick in. The smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla, with kumquat and lime. Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
2579,"<price>471<rating>94<whiskey>Samaroli Over an Islay Rainbow 2017 Edition, 45%<review>Aromatic with smoke, this lays down thick chocolate ganache, toffee banana, and salted caramel. It bowls you over with chocolate-dipped sultanas, soft melon, and ripe berries ahead of a spicy middle section replete with pepper, coriander, cinnamon, fig rolls, baking chocolate, and a dry finish of cocoa and peppery spices. As blended Islay malts go, pretty special."
2580,"<price>22<rating>82<whiskey>Celtic Honey Liqueur, 30%<review>Following in the footsteps of Bushmills Irish Honey, Castle Brands tries their hand at a light and sweet Irish whiskey-based liqueur. Strong clover honey dominates with caramel, vanilla bean, cinnamon, and a little ginger spice. Hard to get to the base whiskey through all the sweet notes, but that seems to be the point. Just short of cloying, this is a whiskey-based liqueur for those more interested in the liqueur than the whiskey."
2581,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Matsui The Peated, 48%<review>Satisfyingly smoky, with noticeable structure and complexity: grilled fish, burning aromatic grasses, cocoa powder, and jellied and tropical fruit flavors. Soft pulpy fruits to taste, with red apple, nippy ginger and pepper spices, a surge of orange and mango flavors, and a backdraft of smoke. The nostrils still detect a delightful kipperiness. Smoke writhes like a serpent on the finish, sliding off walls dripping with sweet tropical fruits. (3,972 bottles)"
2582,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey> The Glenrothes Vintage 2004, 43%<review>This was matured in American oak sherry-seasoned casks. The nose offers cherry liqueur, sultanas, fruit spice, honey, and new leather. Vanilla and sweet orchard fruits on the early palate, followed by darker berry fruits, soft oak, and a savory note. Cocoa powder and a wisp of smoke in the medium-length finish. (3,150 bottles for U.S.)"
2583,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>J. Riddle Peated Bourbon, 45.5%<review>There’s no missing the peat here; the nose is rife with ash, rubber tires, wood-burning fireplace, and cedar bark. But it also reveals lovely aromas of roasted apples, charred corn, black pepper, and roasted walnuts. Sweet corn, apples, honey, and nuts step forward on the palate, which is a bit hot, along with black pepper, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and oak. The finish is enjoyable ashiness—the end of a cigar."
2584,"<price>125<rating>81<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Destillaré Orange Curaçao Barrel-Finished, 50%<review>

Unmistakable orange nose of marmalade and curaçao, dripping with sweet grape jam. Despite all the initial sweetness on the palate, it quickly turns hot without really finding a moment of balance. May find fans, but generally feels like a well-intentioned experiment that ended up much too heavy-handed. (3,000 bottles)—"
2585,"<price>280<rating>95<whiskey>Highland Park  1973 vintage 33 year old (Cask #13308), 54.4%<review>Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, Dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this, I feel like I’m sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
2586,"<price>66<rating>84<whiskey>Armorik Maitre de Chai, 47.3%<review>Seaweed piled in a beach bonfire, Keemun tea, hide-covered tomes, and toffee apples. Soupy, salty smoke without the heat on this dram, which was matured for 6 years in first-fill oloroso. The flavors bring an array of apple peelings, cough sweets, aniseed, and roasted sesame seed before developing some savory elements of roast pork. A spicy tingle takes you through to the finish. Water coaxes out apple jelly and pear notes. (1,000 bottles) €58"
2587,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Bone Snapper X-Ray Straight Rye 4 year old (Batch 1), 55%<review>At first, fruit and charred oak own the moment, only to be interrupted by petrol, florals, and earth. Spice sets in with an abundance of sweetness following. Then, a lovely explosion of fresh-baked rye rolls with hints of pomegranate, orange peel, banana, and apple. Pepper spices remain to the end where a medium finish, with hints of cinnamon await."
2588,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Pinhook 4 year old Bourbon War Straight Bourbon, 49%<review>A rather innocuous bourbon, it shows some of the pep that its namesake racehorse surely shares, with aromas of banana pudding, banana peel, lemon, vanilla, cloves, licorice, cherry hard candy, and cornbread. There’s zingy lemon and orange, rose oil, vanilla, cherry, and some herbal flavors on the palate, with more banana peel, candied fruit, and lemon oil on the finish."
2589,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Shieldaig 14 year old, 40%<review>Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer, this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness."
2590,"<price>200<rating>95<whiskey>Glenfarclas 1968 Vintage, 43%<review>It has been quite a while since we’ve seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but, after tasting this whisky, it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky, providing a dry, oaky spiciness, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky, without any of the down side. I’m told that most of the 1,400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It’s worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle."
2591,"<price>85<rating>90<whiskey>Barrell 13 year old Bourbon (Batch 009), 56.05%<review>Think of an Almond Joy candy bar: coconut, almond, and milk chocolate, followed by the candy bar’s rival flavors: caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch. Then oak, leather, cigar box, marmalade, grape jelly, a plethora of baking spices, and toffee. This beautiful study of barrel strength bourbon needs no water. Caramel in all forms, from candied to syrup, follows this home for a long and delightful finish."
2592,"<price>162<rating>92<whiskey>Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland whisky, 47.3%<review>Rarely has a blend caused as much excitement as this one, but with good reason. This is also known as the Shackleton whisky, and is a recreation of the whisky abandoned in the Antarctic by explorer Ernest Shackleton more than 100 years ago. It has lemon, spring blossom, and wafts of smoke on the nose. The taste is full and citrusy, with peat and pepper in attendance. Beautifully balanced and outstanding, but there are just 50,000 bottles, so snap it up."
2593,"<price>66<rating>87<whiskey>BenRiach 12 year old 1994 vintage, 56%<review>Leafy bonfire smoke, damp kiln, tar, anise, dark chocolate, and a hint of clove. All this is balanced by an underlying malty foundation and a kiss of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit. Nice to see single cask, cask strength bottlings of peated BenRiach. (Exclusive to The Party Source)"
2594,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Lac’ Holl Vieil Or, 42%<review>Gilbert Holl brewed beer in Ribeauvillé, but then began to distill his local malted barley to produce the first whisky from Alsace. This 8 year old has an attractively perfumed nose of Parma violets, dunnage warehouse, and wood smoke, with top notes of apricot and peach. Plunge into a thick, fruity mouthfeel of melting orange sorbet flecked with lime zest, and a moreish, mouth-coating finish of tropical fruits. Punching above its weight, this is highly recommended (Alsace only) €49"
2595,"<price>50<rating>75<whiskey>Highspire Pure Rye, 40%<review>Made from 100% rye, but aged in wine casks. Distinctly pink tinge: rosé whiskey. Very young nose: rye grain, Starburst candies, and feinty vegetable notes along with the wine-oak. Thin, dry, reminiscent of a dry hay barn: dusty grain, warm wood planks, a bit medicinal. Aged 130 days, and tastes like it. Growing up in Pennsylvania, Highspire was a town we stayed out of. Good advice."
2596,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Egan’s Centenary, 46%<review>Ireland’s penchant for cognac-cask finishing continues to impress with this single malt and grain blend, which marks the centenary of the death of company namesake and Irish nationalist Henry Egan, who made tweed suits a symbol of protest. With a delicate nose of peach, passion fruit, white blossom, lime, pear, rose water, and sweet grain, the cognac flavors coddle the palate with peach, fudge, a whizz of spice, vanilla sponge, and grapefruit. (5,995 bottles)"
2597,"<price>32<rating>81<whiskey>J.R. Revelry Bourbon, 45%<review>Very sweet and simple aroma, like plain jelly beans, with only a whisper of the heat you’d expect at 45%. Better on the tongue; proper heat, some cornpone, a bed of oak. Smooth, good balance, good finish. Nothing stands out, but nicely made. Loses points on the nose, and typifies the Small Producer Dilemma: why bottle a good bourbon? Beam and Heaven Hill do that already, cheaper than you ever will. Sourced whiskey."
2598,"<price>694<rating>86<whiskey>Glenglassaugh, 30 year old, 43%<review>An intriguing whisky. Blueberry cobbler, crushed grape, maple syrup, nougat, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). The oak is polished and unimposing. Liqueur-ish. A nice contrast to its younger sibling, and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness. "
2599,"<price>66<rating>84<whiskey>West Cork Port Cask Finish 12 year old, 43%<review>Just 6 months in a port pipe have dressed this whiskey with aromas of Kola Kubes, savory spices, and meat juices, plus the whiff of a damp dog licking your face. Palate of cherry lips, golden delicious apple, and a peppery bite, it careens toward plum, bitter fruit skins, and a medicinal ending of aniseed-laced cough syrup. Like young vintage port, this still has more than a few sharp edges."
2600,"<price>135<rating>86<whiskey>Peerless (distilled at Glenrothes) 1967, 35 year old, 40.5%<review>Antique gold color. Rich, thick malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit, anise, and polished oak. Medium to full in body and rich in texture and flavor, with chewy toffee, roasted nuts, vanilla fudge, and candied fruit. Soothing finish, with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft, leathery dryness. 
"
2601,"<price>888<rating>82<whiskey>The Notch, 44.4% ABV<review>The price, the proof, and 8 years of age reflect the source: the Triple 8 distillery. Light fruit — white grapes, nectarine — and a bit of resiny plastic in the nose, plus a hint of wine wood, underlain by malt. Clean malt in the mouth, well-integrated with nothing sticking out or unbalanced. The fruit’s still there, but diminished; finish is a little clingy but clean. Nicely-made whisky…but it’s like a really good dish of vanilla ice cream; is that all? "
2602,"<price>45<rating>81<whiskey>Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Hickory Wood, 47%<review>Grassy aromas mingle with white pepper, honeysuckle, jasmine, and newsprint on the nose. The palate rushes through sweet vanilla-cake and ripe fruit flavors, with strong oak and alcohol influence, to a finish that is mostly wood with some pleasant chocolate and herbal notes. Disjointed at times, but water helps bring it together.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies, but usually around 3 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using hickory wood pieces."
2603,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Blanton’s Single Barrel (no. 498), 46.5%<review>Oh, that rickhouse smell: charred oak, leather, vanilla, and a slight hint of coconut. Then it’s caramel, toasted walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, and moon pie, with hints of black licorice and cumin. Strong tobacco and ginger notes present themselves just before a delightful finish with hints of crème brûlée and vanilla custard. This is a regular sipper in my house."
2604,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Springbank 15 year old, 46%<review>The nose is complex, with almonds, coconut, soft leather, tropical fruits, and stewed black tea. Hints of brine and peat appear. The palate is rounded and rich, with more tropical fruits, sherry, caramel, pipe tobacco, wood smoke, and spicy tannins. The finish is relatively long and creamy, with lingering smokiness. All the classic Springbank elements merge nicely here."
2605,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blenders’ Batch No. 3 Triple Grain American Oak 10 year old, 41.3%<review>Wheat, corn, and malted barley are your three grains here. Orange grove before harvest, a rounded candied peel note, plenty of sweet grain, and creamy vanilla, all backed by gentle spice. Luscious and chewy caramel, taffy candy, lavishly rich orange, and glowing spice notes wrap around the tongue. It’s incredible how they can make this tasty blend of five whiskies look so devastatingly easy (when it’s not). Value Pick"
2606,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Paddy, 40%<review>This summons up plenty of snappy grain notes, with green apple, melon rind, and zested lemon bumping into dried chili, green tomato, damp hay bales, and a dose of spice. It’s sweeter than a kitten with a ball of wool: lemon bonbons, toffee, vanilla cream, banana chews, zesty mandarin, apple, butterscotch, pepper, and clove. Sour apple pips, burnt sugar and spice, and some residual vanilla creaminess see it out."
2607,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>Red Spot, 46%<review>A heart of pot still spices, but this has oodles of complexity and depth with concentrated autumnal flavors of apple and blackberry cooked with brown sugar, then morello cherry, hazelnut, allspice, aged tobacco leaf, and worn leather. Mellow dark-toffee sweetness and cooked fruits carry the cinnamon and peppercorn, oak, and leather into a tongue-pounding finish. A slap in the chops—just what you want from a pot still whiskey."
2608,"<price>34<rating>90<whiskey>Gooderham & Worts, 44.4%<review>Innovation is key at Windsor’s Corby Distillers. Though best known for its Wiser’s range, Corby also makes this juicy new four-grain beauty. Big and firm on the palate, G&W glides into a buttery corn-whisky slather flooded with delicate rye flowers, nutty dusty barley, and soft, sweet wheat notes. Want the list? Crisp clean oak, citrus pith, stewed fruits, meadow flowers, and brisk pepper with mildly pulling tannins. (Canada only) C$45"
2609,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Booker’s (Batch No. C06-B-15), 64.45%<review>Aged 7 years, 1 month, and 7 days. Big and chewy, with nutty toffee, molasses, nougat, tobacco, pencil shavings, subtle
fruit, and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Leather, barrel char, and a hint of licorice root on the finish. Big, bold, and very enjoyable."
2610,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Old Bones 10 year old Reserve, 55%<review>This straight bourbon is a race of notes trying to outrun each other. Out of the gate, it’s caramel and vanilla, with a bevy of fruit, soft florals, and chocolate slightly trailing. Oak and smoke take the lead on the first turn, then an explosion of butterscotch and Spanish flan setting the pace. Then graham crackers, marshmallow, and melted chocolate eye the prize, with rich, rounded caramel custard taking the long route to the finish line. Definite contender!"
2611,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Bruichladdich Links 14 year old, 46%<review>Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). Still, that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing."
2612,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Westland Peated Single Malt, 46%<review>Briney sea air, wet stones, and pretty wisps of campfire smoke give this a strong Scottish bent, while the medium-bodied palate nicely balances the sweet malt, salt, and smoke in a bit of salt water taffy. Showing nice complexity and balance overall, the finish smolders and evolves to become more herbaceous."
2613,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 72.05%<review>Distilled in 2001, this year’s release is a departure from recent releases, which were complex and nicely balanced. It’s more aggressive, with tannins and oak dominating, and lacking the body and sweetness to balance it. It’s my least favorite of this year’s offerings. Dark chocolate, toffee, tobacco, and dried fruit round out the palate and offer some comfort. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016"
2614,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Shieldaig 14 year old Islay, 40%<review>The nose offers rubbery-sweet peat and an array of fruit: apples, strawberries, raspberries, guava, mango, watermelon, and jackfruit, shot through with briny oyster shells. Juicy fruit—kiwi, guava, orange, pineapple—on the palate mingles with minerality, medicinal peat, dark chocolate, and salt. The finish is beach bonfire smoke, grilled pineapple, and finally, tobacco leaf. This is balanced and beautiful, but would be downright stunning at a higher proof. (Total Wine & More)"
2615,"<price>700<rating>94<whiskey>Michter’s 20 year old Straight Bourbon 2018 (Batch 18I1371), 57.1%<review>Age is readily apparent, not as weariness, but sheer intensity—like a Vise-Grip handshake from an old man. The flavors come in rapid waves, first on the nose with pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, sassafras, cassis, licorice, orange peel, and menthol-like hints of solvent. Then chewy fruit and drying oak harmonize on the palate, the dark berry fruits playing off the refined oak with its cedary spice. The drying finish echoes of rustling autumn leaves and plum skins. Exquisitely balanced and muscular."
2616,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Chattanooga 91 Proof Straight Bourbon (Batch 19F17R), 45.5%<review>This four-grain bourbon (corn, rye malt, caramel malt, and honey malt) starts with aromas of herb garden and notes of strawberry, dried apricot, orange, and licorice. There’s more apricot and orange on the palate, as well as candied almonds, tiramisu, light oak, and pepper spice. The finish has maltiness and is also spiced and nutty, with chocolate sauce and an earthy back note. Rich and sweet, with balanced herbs and spice."
2617,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay (2019 Release), 50%<review>This expression was distilled from barley harvested on Islay in 2007 and 2009, and combines whisky aged in 43 bourbon barrels. Sweet peat, lemon juice, and sea salt on the nose, with honey, vanilla, and an herbal note. The palate opens with overt peatiness, followed by brine and lemon, plus vanilla and a hint of charcoal. Long in the finish, with ashy peat and sea salt. (1,440 bottles for U.S.)"
2618,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Wheat Whiskey, 40%<review>Distilled from 100% white winter wheat; pale straw. Salty dough and sweet, light canned fruit. Like grain whisky on the tongue: light, sweet, delicate, more fruit cocktail, and a hint of milk chocolate. A smooth and pleasant finish. Simple but delightful."
2619,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey>Blade and Bow 22 year old 2017 Release, 46%<review>This is a re-release of the 2015 bottling. A tapestry of confectionery delights begins this journey, followed by fruit, cigar box, saddle leather, cotton candy, roasted pecans, caramel, and marshmallow. Then, it’s smoked paprika, fig, cinnamon, strawberry, and dark cherries. In the form of walnut shells, a powerful and somewhat pleasant bitterness finds the finish, with a hint of chocolate. But that bitterness does supersede the more pleasant notes, making it slightly unbalanced."
2620,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Artist's Blend, 43%<review>After a series of esoteric and expensive releases, Compass Box has decided to bring it all back to the people with a blend — and how! The journey sets out as we might expect; all sweet vanilla ice cream, stewed pear tart, and peach melba, but then a wave of spice and white pepper provides an unexpected but delightful twist. It’s like Spice Tree meets Hedonism…Spiconism if you like."
2621,"<price>500<rating>91<whiskey>Glencadam 25 year old The Remarkable, 46%<review>Nutty on the nose, with a whiff of new leather and tropical fruit, plus the aroma of unsmoked cigars. Complex on the full palate, with almonds, citrus fruit, ginger, plain chocolate, a slight herbal note, and sweet oak. The finish is long and spicy, with black pepper and increasing oak. An often underrated single malt at its very best. (1,600 bottles)"
2622,"<price>22<rating>83<whiskey>Darby’s Reserve Small Batch, 45%<review>Roasted lemon and orange peels, grilled apples, nutmeg, ginger, and Popsicle stick on the nose. Citrus-flavored hard candies, cinnamon, cloves, iced tea, apple skins, and drying wood on the palate, which takes water well. This is simple, wood-forward, and immature, but the flavors are pleasant. (Total Wine & More)"
2623,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Gibson’s Finest Rare 18 year old, 40%<review>A quintessential Canadian whisky that holds fresh-cut lumber, hot white pepper, and creamy oak caramels in delicate balance. Long years in oak have delivered a range of complex flavors that evolve slowly in the glass and on the tongue. Sweet vanilla contrasts with dusty rye, while a drop of pickle juice slowly matures into poached pears with cloves. Dry grain ripens into fresh-baked biscuits before it all fades away in clean oak and citrus pith. C$75"
2624,"<price>48<rating>85<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Experimental TR-06, 43%<review>One of two blended whiskies vying to be the official next Great King Street release, this is the peated version and it's gustier than the original, with less citrus and more peat. Indeed, it's impressively full-flavored, with peat in the driving seat and ginger cake, lime, and dark chocolate, biscuits and pepper in the mix. Best of all, unlike far too many Scotch whiskies this year, it doesn't use peat to hide immature spirit. £30"
2625,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Whiskey Acres Rye, 43.5%<review>This high-rye expression (75% rye) has a nose of citrus, dried tea leaves, and a fennel note, rounded out by a pleasant sweetness that’s laced with Christmas cake, cocoa, clove, and cinnamon. The palate is rich chocolate balanced by citrus oil, nutmeg, walnut, and white pepper. The finish is warm, silky, and full. Well integrated, balanced, and sophisticated, this whiskey is elegant beyond its age."
2626,"<price>24<rating>78<whiskey>Copper Fox Rye Spirit, 62%<review>New make fruit—pear, stewed apple—and rye spice in a hot, clean nose. That’s pretty much what you get in the mouth, too, with some dry paper notes, and a sweet finish. For some reason, I really want to try mixing this with Dr. Pepper. This is definitely a mixing spirit, mountain-style."
2627,"<price>123<rating>80<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Moine PX 12 year old, 52.7%<review>Bunnahabhain’s peaty expression is steadily coming together. It’s been one of those drams that seems to need more time than many, but that’s true of Bunna’ in general, come to think of it. In fact, the peatiness is quite mild on the nose, adding some scent to the sandalwood elements and obvious raisined sweetness. There’s a slightly cheesy note in the background and a touch of sulphur on the palate. It’s not quite wholly integrated, but progressing well. (Fèis Ìle 2016, 833 bottles) £95"
2628,"<price>80<rating>81<whiskey>Highland Park 1991 vintage 14 year old (Cask #2310), 56.7%<review>Generally sweet notes of honeyed fruit, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and salt water taffy. Soft, gently briny finish. Pleasing enough of a whisky -- with no miscues -- but missing the depth found in some of the older bottlings. (Bottled for Texas)"
2629,"<price>13<rating>75<whiskey>Hayes Parker Reserve Spice, 45%<review>Faint spice aroma becomes more apparent after sitting for 20 minutes; initial pour smelled much like the Reserve Cherry (see below). Christmas cookie spices. Thick and sweet, spice is more evident. Not bad, but pretty thick and not much bourbon flavor for 45%."
2630,"<price>76<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Scotia Heavily Peated 10 year old, 50%<review>Higher in strength than the standard Glen Scotia 10 year old, this heavily peated expression is part of the distillery’s Legends of Scotia series, and celebrates Campbeltown's historic Picture House. Just 6,000 bottles. Fruity peat on the nose, with lots of apricot and peach notes. Finally, fresh cigarette ash. Voluptuous in the mouth, and fruity, then sweet spice and drier peat notes develop. The finish is medium to long, with spicy tar. €70"
2631,"<price>119<rating>83<whiskey>Singleton of Glen Ord 18 year old, 40%<review>One in the trio of age-stated Singleton of Glen Ords, this 18 year old has a nose of sultanas, hazelnuts, sherry, vanilla, and a note of pine. Silky on the full palate, with vanilla, milk chocolate, sherry, and caramel. The lengthy finish is drying, with licorice and chili. RM481"
2632,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Doc.52 9 year old Straight Bourbon, 53%<review>Prepare for sensory overload. Aromas of peanut butter blossom cookies, molasses, creamed corn, iced tea, cassis, and marmalade hint at the decadence of the palate, which is mouth-filling and chewy. Its flavors hit all the high points of outstanding bourbon: big and bold grain, chocolate, wet walnuts, orange and cherry Jello, nutmeg, cinnamon, white pepper, tobacco leaf, and waves of oak. Nuts, nuts, and more nuts on the finish, with espresso, chocolate, and drying oak. Sourced from an undisclosed Tennessee distillery. 186 bottles; Doc’s Wine, Spirits & More exclusive"
2633,"<price>24<rating>86<whiskey>Dewar’s Highlander Honey, 40%<review>Insistent honey nose, with whisky underneath; the honey is very forward, but still floral and light, fresh. Flavor is pleasant: floral, faintly herbal, and more honey, but again, light and fresh, not cloying, not heavy. There’s a hint of citrus in the finish, and then, finally, there is a slightly sticky character. Not something a single malt drinker would likely reach for, but a respectable entry in the field of flavored whisky."

Classic Bowmore peat smoke and red berried fruit (raspberry, strawberry) are the main components of this whisky, with additional notes of plum, grape skin tannins, currant, caramel, and marzipan. Good grip from the Limousin oak (wine casks). Some brine and damp cellar notes emerged occasionally, with the smoke lingering long on the finish.

2635,"<price>125<rating>91<whiskey>Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye, 53.7%<review>Delivering a buttery mouthfeel with toasted rye and baking spice notes, Peerless is the only craft producer on our list. It’s hard to pinpoint why this young rye succeeds where others fail, but one point of difference is the use of sweet mash fermentation, rather than the much more common sour mash technique, where spent mash is added to the new fermentation. Furthermore, the Peerless warehouse achieves temperatures upward of 110 degrees. Whatever the technical reasons, Peerless is paving the way and we expect more craft distillers to join them.

2636,"<price>109<rating>94<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Tokaji Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Batch No. AH02), 60.71%<review>The sweet vanilla, almond, and coconut aromas don’t prepare you for the chocolaty
richness of the palate, but don’t stress; just enjoy the journey. It starts with Almond
Joy, crème brûlée with fresh blackberries, nougat, and marzipan, then progresses to
cacao nibs, dried cranberries and cherries, and a striking amaretto flavor. Everything
wraps up neatly—and lengthily—with cocoa powder, black pepper, mocha, and
roasted walnuts. Don’t be shy about watering generously; this can quite a bit.

2637,"<price>55<rating>83<whiskey>Tullibardine, 1993 Vintage, 40%<review>This Highlander is Lowland-ish in style, but with more heft. There’s soft barley sweetness, notes of vanilla and orange creamsicle. Grassy notes emerge from time to time. It is clean and very drinkable. An ideal aperitif, but could be enjoyed anytime between dawn and dinner. Whoever said whisky was an after-dinner drink never tasted this whisky. 
"
2638,"<price>80<rating>79<whiskey>Bruichladdich 16 year old 1989 vintage, 50%<review>Aged in bourbon oak and then finished in Guigal Hermitage Rouge Syrah wine casks. Bright notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, currant, plum, and (not surprisingly) grape, with background notes of vanilla and caramel. I find the syrah notes entertaining on the nose, but too dominant on the palate for balance. The fruit becomes waxy and hides a lot of Bruichladdich subtle complexities. (Bottled exclusively for The Party Source.)"
2639,"<price>74<rating>89<whiskey>Two Brewers Special Finishes Release 15, 43%<review>Canada’s Yukon Territory, with its wolves, bears, and numbing cold, does not evoke images of fine single malts. Nosing the dark fruit and malty goodness of Two Brewers whiskies corrects that misconception. Complex tobacco, sweet dark chocolate, red wine, and halva become vaguely tannic barrel tones and searing spices cushioned in sweet canned fruit and cream. Malt melds into Band-Aid and dry grain. Artfully balanced complexity. $98 CAD"
2640,"<price>100<rating>95<whiskey>Crown Royal Cask No. 16, 40%<review>Crown Royal has always been a very stylish, silky smooth whisky. This bottling adds a new dimension in flavor and texture with its cognac cask finishing. A velvety smooth whisky with notes of creamy vanilla, butterscotch, nougat, dried fruit, and gentle spice are well-defined and nicely balanced. Gently sweet, fruity finish. Crown Royal’s best effort to date."
2641,"<price>71<rating>80<whiskey>Thomson 10 year old, 40%<review>Thomson is a small, independent New Zealand whisky company with a limited amount of stock originally distilled at the Willowbank distillery, and this is as young as New Zealand whisky currently gets. One suspects it would have benefited from a couple more years, but its simple sugar and spice combo and rich citrus heart make it an uncomplicated but very drinkable session malt. It's a waltz of a whisky that kicks a bit at the death. NZ$85"

The nose is soft and warming, with notes of candy, vanilla, and almonds against a sweet sherry background. The palate is rich and rounded with a significant sherry influence—dried fruits, notably raisins and prunes, new leather, and aniseed. Finally, slightly mouth-drying with prickly spices and more raisins. (2016 Jura Tastival whisky festival exclusive) £85"
2643,"<price>32<rating>85<whiskey>Downslope Double Diamond, 40%<review>More pale than other crafts I usually see; the whiskey is 12 to 21 months old and spends time serially in wine casks, medium toast American oak barrels, and finally “very experienced” French oak. Smell is
quite young, but clean, with notes of orange and rye grain, and a whiff of nutty toffee. Quite a lively mouth, with much more toffee, less orange, a hint of odd spice (cardamom?), and a twist of milk chocolate at the finish. Interesting stuff."
2644,"<price>94<rating>85<whiskey>Telsington IV 2012, 42%<review>Last time we reviewed Telsington it came with a warning. Everything from triple distillation, unusual ways of drying the barley, and through to Pinot Noir wine casks for maturation is designed to take you from your comfort zone. Not for everyone, we wrote. But this is a big step on. There’s an almost bourbon or rye quality to this. There’s burnt toffee and stewed red berries. Deliberately nothing like scotch, but we’re starting to see
what Marcus Telser is aiming for. €71"

This year’s expression was matured in a combination of refill and rejuvenated American oak barrels and bodega European oak butts. Fresh and spicy on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas. Creamy on the palate, with fruit-and-nut milk chocolate bars, plus notes of developing citrus. The finish is slightly earthy, with wood spices."
2646,"<price>79<rating>91<whiskey>Ailsa Bay, 48.9%<review>The first release from Ailsa Bay distillery is an NAS peated single malt. The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It’s then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (UK and Nordic availability) £55"

Now the owner of the old Caperdonich stills and set for major expansion, Belgian Owl is literally on the move. Let's hope it retains the greatness of this malt. This is the distillery's best offering yet: a sweet, rich, vanilla-laced fruity dessert whisky that is both refreshing and very more-ish. Alcoholic tinned fruits, particularly pear. "
2648,"<price>42<rating>86<whiskey>Glencadam Origin 1825, 40%<review>New in 2016, this is an NAS entry-level bottling for the brand, matured in bourbon barrels before spending a finishing period in oloroso sherry butts. Sweet and malty on the nose, a hint of mash, then pineapple. Becoming more floral, with violets. The palate offers soft fruit notes, cocoa powder, light sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee and soft spices."

Mossman Gold Crown 12 year old, 40%<review>Aromas of oloroso sherry, strawberry, almond paste, clove, licorice Allsorts, black treacle, and smoke from burning haystacks. Honeyed palate with citrus elements, light lemon, green melon, pear, redcurrant, and pineapple, brightened by some well-rounded spices and root ginger. It glides into a mouthful of chocolate-coated digestive biscuits with a little smoke, then a finish of citrus oils, fruit skins, and active spices. Brilliant and satisfying."

The texture is mouth drawing and astringent, like it’s warping the dimensions of your mouth for its own ends. Dark chocolate and bitter plum transition into cocoa powder and plum pudding with traces of oak. Persistent heat, with herbal notes and chili spice on the finish. Leave the water aside.

Sinclair Four Grain Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Made with an unusual mashbill—corn, wheat, caramel malt, and oats—this whiskey was aged for 2 years. Grain, bread dough, almond paste, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. The palate has fresh wood shavings, cinnamon, bread dough, orange Popsicle, and walnuts, with a dry chocolate and oak finish. A bit more maturation time should soften some of the youthful edges."
2652,"<price>96<rating>79<whiskey>Port Askaig 19 year old, 58.6%<review>London-based specialist The Whisky Exchange won’t reveal where its main Islay brand is distilled, though the smart money is on a distillery not that far away from the ferry terminal that gives it its name. This expression is less phenolic than you might expect; there’s more rapeseed oil than smoke, but it does have a nori wrap shoreline character. The palate is discreet, with pineapple and creaminess leading the way toward a bonfire made of old fishboxes. £60"

This whisky, finished in a cask with Japanese cherrywood heads, begins delicately with sweet fruit syrups, before unwrapping golden caramel with a core of spice. Baked apple notes, strudel, unsweetened citrus, and a tang of bitter fruits, which abate to a mouth-coating finish of orange oil. (3,972 bottles)"

Allspice, cloves, and cinnamon Red Hots are interwoven with caramel-coated shortbread, dark chocolate, and walnuts on the nose. Zingy and lively on the palate, with cinnamon, allspice, cloves, sandalwood, nuts, and semi-sweet chocolate. With water the flavors deepen, adding burnt sugar, vanilla bean, orange oil, and roasted nuts. The spices fade with a slow burn, mingling with sturdy oak and coffee bean. (3,000 bottles)"
2656,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Aberlour 12 year old, 40%<review>Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks.

2657,"<price>350<rating>92<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Mizunara Oak Cask-Finished Kentucky Straight, 48.9%<review>
A very pretty and delicate whiskey that becomes more beguiling with each sniff. Following the initial peanut, vanilla, and caramel notes, it slowly reveals incense, dried pineapple, and stone fruits sprinkled with spice. The palate is generously sweet, with peach tea and soft wood tannins lending lovely texture, before a finish of zesty citrus, tobacco leaf, and exotic spice. Finished for two years in new charred mizunara oak."
2658,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Barr An Uisce 16 year old 1803, 46%<review>Vanilla buttercream, honey, sweet oak, granola, and toasted spice with a pinch of pepper demonstrate the beauty of bourbon-cask maturation for Irish single malt. This is sweet, silky, and carefree, with citrus, honey, oat cereal, and black pepper. The spices grip the tongue, yielding to flavors of crystallized pineapple and grapefruit in the latter stages. Lemon, orange, and spices on a long, satisfying finish. Straight-forward, darn good whiskey. (1,803 bottles)"
2659,"<price>45<rating>80<whiskey>White Oak Akashi Japanese Blended Whisky, 40%<review>Like a trip to the stalls of an old spice market, the traders beckoning you closer with their colorful wares. Nutmeg, fennel seed, and caraway on the nose, then papery dried oak leaves, toast crumbs, and slightly pungent notes of chive and shucked pea pods. This is a fatter, more glutinous whisky than the single malt. Lemon glaze, fudge, honey, nectarine, and kumquat balance an undercurrent of pepper, cinnamon, and mustard seed. A slightly sour swallow, then the spices reign supreme."
2660,"<price>53<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan Springwood, 40%<review>Part of Auchentoshan’s new travel retail line-up, Springwood carries no age statement, contains younger whiskies than Heartwood, and has been matured in 100 percent ex-bourbon wood. Acetone, tinned peaches in vanilla, and whipped cream on the floral nose. The palate is clean and fruity, initially citric, with emerging apricots in honey, and fresh spices. More spice in the finish, with focuses on milk chocolate, cinnamon, and a suggestion of Madeira. €42"
2661,"<price>88<rating>85<whiskey>Glenrothes Sherry Cask Reserve, 40%<review>Bold, with a slightly blunt entrance. The cask influence is to the fore, mixing rum and raisin with a slight yeasty/dough-like edge that sits alongside caramelized fruits. In time, there’s sweet draff, malt loaf (with butter), and the smell of old cupboards. It gets creamier with water. Medium-bodied with a light savory note in the middle that then drifts toward Brazil nut, and Assam tea. A solid performer. Bristol Milk sherry rather than old oloroso. £55"
2662,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Benriach The Smoky Twelve, 46%<review>

Benriach is a sleeper of a single malt, but that’s about to change. Part of a 2020 relaunch of its core line, this grabbed our attention with its sophistication, breadth of flavors, and lovely refinement. Much of the credit surely goes to master blender Rachel Barrie for creating a smoky whisky that both peat lovers and the peat-wary can enjoy. Rather than medicinal intensity, the peat is redolent of gentle, sweetly smoky fruits that integrate seamlessly with notes of vanilla, toasted almond, chocolate, blueberry, and bacon. It beckons like the wafting smoke of a warming autumn bonfire, then welcomes with its lush and velvety embrace. Number 3 in the 2020 Top 20"
2663,"<price>168<rating>89<whiskey>Craigellachie 19 year old, 46%<review>Here, Craigellachie is slimmed down and appears in slightly leaner guise, with an aromatic spritz of vetiver-heavy male cologne coming across first before fresh fruits follow on. More crisp and with slightly more obvious toasted structure. The pineapple distillery character is now dried, before the palate shows sweet chocolate pudding, char, honeysuckle, herbs, and white fruits. A classy (and large) package. (Travel Retail only) €135/liter"
2664,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Vesey’s Straight Bourbon, 47%<review>This bourbon from South Carolina’s Charleston Distilling Co. has a nose that starts with a chalky minerality, but fruit leather, strawberry, and blueberry quickly emerge, along with notes of candy corn, caramel, and chocolate fondue. The palate offers bitter chocolate, grape, and cherry, with caramel, roasted nuts, and coconut lingering on the back palate. The finish is nutty and bittersweet, with lingering fruitiness on a warm and chocolaty finish."
2665,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Anchor Old Potrero Hotalings Bottling 11 year old, 50%<review>(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15, No. 3.) Certainly the most idiosyncratic of the bunch. A great whiskey if you like the flavors, but some might find the spices to be too “over the top,” and almost gin-like. Try it before you buy it."
2666,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Moray 15 year old, 40%<review>Aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks; the nose is initially relatively reticent, slightly earthy, with a hint of drinking chocolate, emerging sherry notes, and subtle orange. Toffee, more chocolate, and spicy dried fruits on the relatively full-bodied palate. Long in the finish, with wood spices."
2667,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>James E. Pepper 1776 Straight Rye PX Sherry Finish, 50%<review>Cherry cola, sassafras, and root beer barrels meet sweet vanilla and roasted coffee aromas. The lavish oak almost feels double barreled, or small barreled, with its bounty of spiced flavors—cinnamon, nutmeg, mincemeat, and spiced poached pears. The finish deals more oak, laden with dark chocolate. Nicely executed, with some youth perhaps cloaked in there."
2668,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Barrell American Whiskey (Batch 003), 52.65%<review>A composite of Tennessee and Kentucky whiskeys, finished in sherry butts and port pipes. It’s sherry-forward, but rich and layered in roasted nuts, caramel, dried caramel, vanilla cake batter, chocolate, chamomile, and roasted apple. Marzipan and honey flash with hints of hazelnut, pear, and molasses cookie over a slightly chewy mouthfeel. The medium to long finish gives a slight hint of citrus."
2669,"<price>25<rating>89<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1992 Vintage (Barrel #1), 45%<review>Amber chestnut color. Rich, sweet aromas of toffee, maple syrup, soft candied fruit, and molasses, balanced by an oaky dryness and subtle spice notes. Thicker and fuller in body than previous vintages, with a somewhat silky texture. On the palate, the whiskey begins smooth and sweet, with notes of maple syrup, toffee, and soft ripe fruit, gradually increasing in intensity as spice (vanilla, subtle mint) and oak notes kick in. Lengthy finish."
2670,"<price>74<rating>86<whiskey>Clynelish Distillers Edition 1993, 43%<review>When this first appeared I found it too sweet, which was strange, as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. This most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. There’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old, while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. The waxiness is there but the candle is scented. It still clings to the tongue, but there is an added nutty, oxidized character. A marked improvement.£47"
2671,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Dry Fly Washington Wheat, 45%<review>Wheats have a fruitier nose than bourbons, it seems, and this is no exception. Gentle, almost delicate fruits on the nose: white grapes, honeydew melon, baked apple. So smooth on the palate: sweet pastry, light baked apple, a nice oak grip keeping it all together. Sip it straight, or build a big highball with just a splash of soda on the ice. Such a friendly whiskey."
2672,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Stranahan’s 10 year old Mountain Angel Colorado (Batch 001), 47.3%<review>
The nose is reticent and doesn’t yield much, but candied lemon peel, strawberry, grape soda, and jasmine perfume emerge. It’s super sweet and fruity on the palate, like a bag of Skittles; guava, pineapple, mango, kiwi, and cantaloupe shine, with a length of oak to temper the effusive brightness. The finish is fairly short, and overall a bit more muted than the palate suggests."
2673,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Bourbon (Batch 019), 54.7%<review>A blend of 9 to 14 year old bourbons from Tennessee and Kentucky. A generous and perfumy nose of dusty spice, peanut brittle, cherry candy, orange, cola, molasses, and roasted grain. Full and rich in the mouth, with fruit leather, blueberry-pomegranate juice, orange oil, ginger, pepper, dark chocolate, cola, molasses, and coconut. The finish is lengthy and superb: horehound candy, white pepper, dark chocolate-covered blueberries, and silky yet racy oak."
2674,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Jefferson’s Straight Rye Whiskey 10 year old, 47%<review>A 100% straight rye from Canada. This is curiously similar to (and more affordable than) WhistlePig rye, which is also a 100% rye, 10 year old Canadian whisky, but at a slightly higher 50% ABV. (Neither whiskey identifies its origin.) It oozes spice (mint, cinnamon, hint of nutmeg) balanced by layers of sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel), with nutty toffee emerging on the finish."
2675,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Laphroaig Quarter Cask, 48%<review>The whisky begins sweet and creamy, with notes of vanilla, honey, and ripe malt (reminiscent of a malting floor). Then the Laphroaig signature peat smoke, seaweed, tar, and medicinal notes emerge. Bottling at 48% and without chill-filtering keeps the whisky from being dulled down. A whisky that is very dynamic. Nicely done."

These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

Miltonduff was licensed in 1824, and these days is also an important blender’s malt with a little more oily depth than its neighbor, Glenburgie. This has a deep floral bouquet — think iris and lily — and aromatic fruits like quince. With water there’s moss, sage, and orange peel. The fruity character is dominant in the mouth and becomes more tropical; there’s even some coconut on the finish. £40 "
2677,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Glenlivet 12 year old Double Oak, 40%<review>The nose yields orange and lime, canned pineapple, and light caramel notes. Elegant, with some substance on the palate, with vanilla and brittle toffee underpinned by vibrant orchard fruits, honey, and milk chocolate. The finish features more milk chocolate, gentle oak, and ginger. Best Value"
2678,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>Breakout Rye 8 year old, 43%<review>In the pantheon of rye whiskey, Breakout sits at a coveted 8 years old. The nose offers its age with a hint of oak over the delicate, savory herbal aromas that range from dill to oregano. There’s a slight vanilla note on the second whiff. The palate offers smoke, coffee, smoked paprika, vanilla wafers, and a hint of chocolate, followed by a medium-length finish, making me wish this was just 10 proof points higher. Sourced whiskey."
2679,"<price>95<rating>84<whiskey>Kilchoman Single Cask Release Cask #370 (distilled 2008, bottled 2014), 59.8%<review>An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)"
2680,"<price>186<rating>91<whiskey>Highland Park Viking Pride 18 year old, 46%<review>This is one of four new additions to the portfolio in 2018, and is the pick of the bunch. It is a ‘marrying-strength’ variant of the 18 year old, relaunched in 2017. Treacle tart, sweet woodsmoke, and milky coffee on the robust nose. The palate is voluptuous, with tangy orange, malt, and more woodsmoke. Milk chocolate and smoky Jaffa oranges in the finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
2681,"<price>185<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan Easter Elchies, 52.3%<review>This is like a blast from the past, with much in common with the sherried Cask Strength of old, and a welcome treat for any fan of the big, sherried Macallans. All the red berry and blood orange notes are present on the nose, along with cocoa and a dusty smokiness. The palate is full, velvety and chewy, with Christmas cake, oranges, and some nuttiness. Nutmeg and cinnamon fill out the mouth feel, before a long and classic sherried finish."
2682,"<price>63<rating>86<whiskey>Madoc Single Malt, 46.1%<review>Grain takes center stage, showing itself in a restrained, sweet manner: aromas of marzipan, oatmeal cookies, Jordan almonds, crushed peanuts on an ice cream sundae, and caramel. The palate is consistent, offering almond croissant, sugar cookie, vanilla pudding, light caramel, and a creamy mouthfeel, finished off with supple oak, caramel, and almonds. Made in Patagonia, Argentina. 2,500 Argentine pesos; Argentina only"
2683,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Ohishi Islay Cask, 41.7%<review>The legacy of the cask’s history imparts more smoke than peat. It hasn’t overpowered the spirit, but the whisky is light enough to be put in the shade, with singeing smoke, coal dust, vanilla, and asphalt. Sweet rice, vanilla, honey, and warm spices of ginger root and black peppercorn, before a late arrival of peat. Milk chocolate, burnt driftwood, toffee, and a little residual pepper on the finish.

2684,"<price>120<rating>84<whiskey>Brenne 10 year old 2015 Release, 48%<review>Brenne’s first age statement whisky, this was matured in virgin French Limousin oak and cognac barrels. It’s a fruit salad of nectarine, white grape juice, watermelon, and pear, with touches of light vanilla and black tea. A cool, clean sip delivers apple, pear, peach, and apricot, followed by an intense wave of citrus, Fruit Pastilles, spice, and orange butter icing. Those spices fade slowly; the residual flavors are fruity rather than sweet. Clear evidence that Brenne is improving all the time."
2685,"<price>180<rating>82<whiskey>Deanston 20 year old Oloroso, 55.3%<review>This cask strength bottling has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note, along with ginger and developing toffee. The palate features unexpectedly dry sherry, rapidly giving treacle, plain chocolate, and dark spices. Hot spices, with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish."
2686,"<price>76<rating>88<whiskey>The English Whisky Co. “Lest We Forget” 1914 – 1918 Limited Edition, 45%<review>A creamy delight: rice pudding laden with swollen raisins, brown sugar melting on hot porridge (if this were scotch, it would be salt). It begins sweet, with a juicy fruitiness before a rodeo of spiciness bucks on the tip of the tongue. The texture is creamy and light but substantial enough to carry these big flavors. Dried lemon and double cream stretch out into a lengthy finish. A unique profile, but a fitting tribute. (1,499 bottles) £50"
2687,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Jim Beam Single Barrel, 47.5%<review>More oak, intensity, depth, maturity, and character than the standard Jim Beam white. Darker sugars too, showing more caramel and light toffee, less honeyed corn and vanilla (although those notes are certainly still present). Subtle mint and cinnamon spice, along with soft fruit and light tobacco on the finish round out the flavor profile. A bourbon comfortably positioned between Jim Beam white and the more premium Signature Series releases."
2688,"<price>45<rating>79<whiskey>Wyoming Whiskey Private Stock Bourbon Unfiltered 6 year old, 56.55%<review>Generously oaky, with sawdust, horse saddle, vanilla, honey, and a chalky, mineral quality on the nose. The palate is mouth-coating, with a full-bodied punch of sweet fruit, caramel, treacle, and heat, but even with dilution, the astringent wood tannins, chalk dust, and dry leathery finish come on too quickly. The rare craft bourbon that might have been better a bit younger. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
2689,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>The Antiquary, 12 year old, 40%<review>Floral aroma with a lively array of orchard fruit and citrus.  Underlying notes of soft honey and vanilla.  Good malt foundation for a blend.  An elegant and breezy ""anytime"" dram.

FEW proofed its straight rye with oolong tea for this unusual whiskey specialty, and while the effect is subtle, it’s unmistakable. Dusty cloves and old cigar box, oolong tea leaves, bundled herbs, polished furniture, and a hint of blueberries and Concord grapes on the nose. The palate is dry and nutty, austere and spare: cocoa powder, herbal oak, licorice tea, mint, raw walnuts, and pecans. More walnuts, mint, licorice, dry oak, and black pepper on the finish."
2691,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Cask & Crew Double Oaked Straight Rye, 48%<review>From Rochester, New York-based Cask & Crew, this was distilled in Canada, matured 4 years in new charred oak, then finished in another new charred oak barrel. Spice, pistachio, and a note of barrel char on the nose, and a nutty, creamy palate with notes of blueberry pie, chocolate, cooked plums, and light spice. The finish offers more spice, coffee cake, and almond nuttiness. The profile is young, but full of good flavors."
2692,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Battle Cry Oloroso Sherry Finish (Batch 2), 46%<review>Deep golden in color with a pinkish cast, this shows good purity of fruit, with red berry, black cherry, toasty oak, and some oxidative nutty notes layered across a creamy, malty palate. A nice grilled-fruit palate echoes with sweetness and charcoal smoke on the long finish. The sherry contributes a lot of nice character, but without more overall maturity feels a bit like window dressing."
2693,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Sonoma County Cask Strength Rye, 54.4%<review>100% rye, unmalted and malted, direct-fire pot stilled, “old wood finished”: a detailed label, but no age statement or “straight.” Peppery, minty nose with a fleeting hint of coal smoke, lots of heat. Fierce rye flavor, hot and sweet, and then a fantastic finish that curls and flexes: sweet, oily, hot, pepper, and small barrel oak. The rest of it’s okay, but that finish is a marvelous ride."
2694,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Pennington Distilling Co. Davidson Reserve Rye, 50%<review>Though it takes some easing into, this whiskey shows pretty clove and vanilla notes on the nose, along with some Elmer’s glue and grape Kool-Aid. The palate is where the rye grain starts to shine, with spice, peaches, plums, and milk and white chocolate, and cooked cherries on the finish. Water is a must to cut through the youthful heat."
2695,"<price>220<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park Triskelion, 45.1%<review>Warm machine oil on the early nose, slightly herbal, with apricots and vanilla
emerging in time. Slick on the palate, with light smoke, honey, delicate spices, and
eventually, burnt toffee. The finish features licorice, pipe tobacco, and white pepper.
Ultimately mouth-drying. £170"

The initial nose is slightly balsamic, with green tea, ripe eating apples, and developing vanilla. Creamy on the palate, with big vanilla custard notes, white pepper, and dates. Relatively short in the finish, with soft spices and mild oak. No negative tannins, despite its age. (1,812 bottles)"
2697,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2013 Release), 60%<review>Thirteen years old, but it shows its age nicely. It’s peppered with complex dried spice notes (mint, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla),
yet it also has interwoven sweet notes (maple syrup, caramel, honey) to keep the whiskey from being too dry. Hints of dark chocolate and berried fruit add complexity. Dry, spicy, tobacco, and leather-tinged finish. Great complexity!"
2698,"<price>110<rating>85<whiskey>Kornog Sant Erwan 2012, 50%<review>Bearing the easiest name of all the Kornogs to pronounce, this is also the least challenging and complex. It is, pretty much, a straightforward peated whisky with more citrus fruits than the others, some apple and pear in the mix, and some chilled spices. The finish is long, smoky, and spicy. Benefits massively from a little water. €86"
2699,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan single malt, 40%<review>When the news arrived that a distillery was being built in Taiwan, the whisky world pretty much dismissed it. When Kavalan appeared at a precocious 42 months, it sat up and took notice. Owned by food and beverage conglomerate King Car, Kavalan started producing in 2006 with blender Ian Chang at the helm — and a hotline to consultant Dr. Jim Swan. Taiwan’s tropical climate pushes the maturation cycle along at a ferocious rate, but the key here is its complexity. Maybe it’s auto-suggestion, but I could swear there’s ginseng in here, as well as honeycomb and black cherry pie filling. Fresh and clean, the spirit is rich and accompanied with great wood.  Mature whisky in three years? It’s an accountant’s dream! "
2700,"<price>143<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Melon Vine 1994 (distilled at Aberfeldy), 46%<review>This 20 year old single cask release from the Perthshire distillery of Aberfeldy runs to 242 bottles, matured in a hogshead. Apricots, green apples, ginger, and icing sugar on the nose. Soft fruits, notably peaches, gingery oak, and more icing sugar on the palate. Milky coffee, caramel, and eucalyptus in the slightly oaky, medium-length finish. £90"
2701,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Bowmore, 18 year old, 43%<review>This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only). The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish.

2702,"<price>27<rating>88<whiskey>Virgil Kaine Ginger Infused Bourbon, 40%<review>Ginger may not be the first flavor that leaps to mind when you think flavored whiskey, but then you realize how common the combination is: Jack and Ginger, Jameson and Ginger, and now Virgil Kaine. Fresh ginger is unmistakable on the nose and the secret to this whiskey’s success. On the palate, fresh ginger seamlessly integrates with oak, black pepper, and clove spice. Underneath is sweet vanilla that helps keep everything in balance. A well-executed and savvy flavored whiskey."

This is melon and vanilla ice cream on the nose; banana, burnt rind, and a sprinkling of pepper on the palate. Youth reveals itself late, but this is dessert whisky at its best. €47 Currently not available in the U.S.  "

A whisky with amazing natural colors and the aromas turned up to 11; polished red apples, mixed peels, currant, clove, peppercorn, and crinkly dried red chiles. Sweet raspberry fudge initially, then the mouth-drawing high alcohol bites, sending it spiraling through clove, plum skins, baked fruit crumble, cookies, charred oak, nutty toffee, black cherry, and coffee grounds. Some single cask whisky can be a rollercoaster: this is the whole theme park! (282 bottles)—"

Soft lemon meringue pie on the palate. Sweeter orange breaks through with a little spice on the fringes, then hits its stride with dried fruits and baked apple. A final flourish of spice and candied peel rounds off this excellent whiskey. Value Pick"
2706,"<price>117<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Kilchoman, Batch 1), 55.5%<review>Startlingly herbal. Penetrating, lifted, and aromatic with dill, mint, and in time, celery leaf and lovage. Smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. Lively and quite different to the official bottling. Water brings unripe pineapple, clove, sugared almond, and horseradish. This has typical Kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. Water brings out flavors of nettles, and saltiness. £69"
2707,"<price>24<rating>78<whiskey>Schenley Golden Wedding, 40%<review>Prior to Prohibition, Golden Wedding was a fine American whiskey. Decades later, entrepreneur Louis Rosenstiel successfully revived the brand in Canada. The result shows hints of burnt toffee, dusty rye, dry grain, and pickle juice. Earthy elements underscore river plants and citrus pith. Hot, peppery spices bolster lively spirits while jammy fruit and floral overtones round out a straight-on mixer. A whisky that transforms ginger ale into ginger ale. (Canada only)C$24"
2708,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>The Irishman 12 year old, 43%<review>Highly aromatic, with allspice, ground cinnamon, and hints of clove. Behind the spice, there is soft vanilla toffee, creamed coconut, and grapefruit peel. A palate comprised of citrus, peel oils, toffee, red berries, sweet barley, cinnamon, pepper, and star anise transition to a greater emphasis on toffee, hints of chocolate, more maltiness, and a little oak. The finish allows the spices to shine. (6,000 bottles) Editors’ Choice"
2709,"<price>47<rating>87<whiskey>(ri)1, 46%<review>Rye whiskey has gone hip. This is a new offering from Beam Global Spirits and Wines, but it is not part of the Jim Beam portfolio. It will be its own new entity. It's crisp and vibrantly spicy, but with a rich, silky sweetness that marries very well with the rye intensity. It is exactly what I think it was designed to be: a mature enough rye whiskey that can be enjoyed neat or on the rocks, but with plenty of youth and vitality to zing in a cocktail. I tasted it next to a couple of the other ''entry level'' straight rye whiskeys to confirm this isn't all just fancy packaging, and it is indeed a superior product. No, it's not one of those ultra-aged rye whiskeys on the market, but it wasn't meant to be either. A nice whiskey, but pricey for a rye with no age statement."
2710,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Big Peat Christmas Edition 2018, 53.9%<review>Windswept and coastal: rock pools, the chalky sweetness of Edinburgh rock candy, and aromas of smoked fish on the quayside. The masochism of bonfire smoke and peat reek is utterly invigorating and restorative. Lemon creaminess, with an eruption of spice and citrus, the irascible spices pushing out in all directions. This is a big, cask strength bruiser, but Peat’s choleric temper can be readily soothed with a drop of water. (1,400 bottles for the U.S.)"
2711,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Myths & Legends III, 46%<review>This is a peat-turbocharged version of Myths &Legends II. Mango, papaya, and burnt sugar meet soot, ground ginger, and aniseed: the bold tropical fruits are an equal match for the smoke. Beginning sharp and crisp with mango and tangerine, this nimble blend lets smoke and more assertive spice notes elbow their way forward, but they achieve consensus in the end. (4,564 bottles)"

This has a slick, oily/waxy texture and a sweet, nutty taste; those circus peanuts meet a stampede of pepper and sugared mice, the alcohol strength coming to the fore at the end. Unexpectedly moreish, this is packed with gum-nipping, tongue-twisting spicy mischief."
2713,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 9 year old, 60.7%<review>A single cask, cask strength whisky finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. The initial nose is slightly earthy, with walnuts, Juicy Fruit gum, vanilla, and ripe peach notes in time. Full, sweet fruit notes on the palate, peaches in syrup, overripe pineapple, with milk chocolate, fudge, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length and perennially spicy, with aniseed notes. (Cask no. 170)"
2714,"<price>52<rating>82<whiskey>Inchmurrin 12 year old, 46%<review>Matured in a mixture of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks.

Medium in length, spicy, with emerging dry oak notes. £36"
2715,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>FEW Rye, 46.5%<review>Solid, chunky bottle with idiosyncratic whiskey inside. Straightforward rye crisps out of the glass in no-nonsense style; dry grain, sweet grass, and light but insistent anise almost wholly drown out the
barrel character. The mouth is as dry and spicy-medicinal as the nose hints at, laying down character like a winning hand: rye SNAP! heat SNAP! light tarragon SNAP! oak SNAP! and a warm wrap-up finish SNAP! Full house, flavors over sensations. Clean and interesting. Nicely played."
2716,"<price>25<rating>91<whiskey>Old Overholt Bottled in Bond Rye (2020 Edition), 50%<review>This relaunched version of Old Overholt’s bonded rye is not chill-filtered, and it makes a noticeable difference. Aromas of cinnamon-sprinkled apple slices, toasted grain, spearmint and peppermint candies, and Cinnamon Life cereal carry into the palate, which balances oak and grain superbly: fresh mint, licorice, black pepper, allspice, cinnamon, cacao nibs, and walnuts. The vivacious spices almost pop in the mouth, but settle down into a satisfying finish of black pepper, cacao, mint, and well-integrated oak. Well-balanced without water, but a few drops serve it well. Best Value"
2717,"<price>500<rating>93<whiskey>Redbreast 27 year old, 54.6%<review>This new permanent addition to the Redbreast range is partially matured in ruby port casks, which have helped the vitality and the complexity of the finished whiskey while still delivering a remarkable intensity of red berry fruit. Orange peel, pine cone, vanilla, and walnut on the nose. Raspberry, cherry, plums, and active spices like a wildfire across the tongue, with pepper and chile heightened by the strength and menthol late on the finish."
2718,"<price>900<rating>85<whiskey>Linkwood 37 year old, 50.3%<review>This is a 1978 veteran from the rebuilt Linkwood Distillery. The nose is slightly musty, even bitter, with sawdust and apple peel. The palate is sweet, with a suggestion of sherbet ‘fizz,’ elusive peatiness, and fruit spice, plus vanilla, walnuts, and ultimately, slightly grippy oak. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (6,114 bottles)"
2719,"<price>30<rating>77<whiskey>Palmetto Whiskey, 44.65%<review>Palmetto distillery has been making ‘moonshine’ products so far, and now they have some spirit aged in new French oak. Aromas of sweet pastry dough, new rubber, horehound, and bitter orange make for an intriguing nose. The mouth is fiery hot, thin in body, and tends to stay that way through to the end. The horehound blends with rye bitterness to make this a bit medicinal. Hot for sipping, but should make a very good Old Fashioned."
2720,"<price>51<rating>84<whiskey>Armorik Classic, 46%<review>Armorik is made by Distilleries Warenghem in the Brittany region of Northern France and you expect something gutsy and rugged. This is nothing of the sort, though the relatively high strength and the fact that it's non-chill filtered ensure plenty of taste, including a scattering of spices that tickle and tingle the palate at the finish. Before then, though, the key flavors are vanilla, honeyed cereal, overripe melon, and banana. Delightful.  €38 "

Rich caramel-apple cider on the nose, along with red candy apple, toasted almonds, cinnamon raisin bread, and earthy spice. It's brightly fruity on the palate, showing off berries, green apple candy, dried figs, and Welch's grape juice, as well as ample spice, dark chocolate, and nuts. Persistent grape and strawberry into the finish, along with roasted walnuts, warming spice, and rich, chocolaty oak."
2722,"<price>44<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan 10 year old Fine Oak, 40%<review>A nicely honeyed malty foundation is balanced by fruit on the front of the palate, with a pleasingly dry, spicy finish. It would benefit by being bottled at 43%, like the older two expressions. It is simple, straight-forward, and unpretentious, as one would expect in a 10 year old whisky."
2723,"<price>30<rating>77<whiskey>Hudson Valley Distillers Chancellor’s Raw Bourbon, 40%<review>Aged one day in new American oak, this white dog ekes out the very minimum requirements for bourbon. The nose is heavy barnyard, complete with hay, horse, and manure. Beyond the funk is cornmeal, cashew, and apple blossom. The palate is light and what you'd expect, with yeasty cornbread, sour apple, apple blossom, and black pepper. The funk is still there but not as intense as on the nose. Interesting overall character with aging potential, but for now it’s unbaked."
2724,"<price>72<rating>88<whiskey>Tomintoul 16 year old, 40%<review>As with most of the Tomintoul range, the nose is quiet, with diluted orange juice and fondant cream in time. The fruity palate majors in canned peaches in cream, with encroaching nuttiness and white pepper. Fruit remains a feature in the medium-length finish, with cocoa and malt."
2725,"<price>800<rating>88<whiskey>Clynelish Select Reserve (Diageo Special Release 2014), 54.9%<review>This Clynelish is notable as the first no age statement Special Release, and maturation took place in refill European and bodega European oak casks, along with first-fill, refill, and rejuvenated American oak casks. The nose is fresh and salty, with olives, pine, and lemongrass, then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. Oily on the palate, with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose, plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. Spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish."

Chewy tannins provide a foil for lively spice on the palate—pepper, ginger, anise, cinnamon—while orange oil, cola, cherry cordial, and black tea provide supporting notes. The finish shows generous earthiness and oak. Takes water well."
2727,"<price>77<rating>90<whiskey>Dingle Single Malt, 46.5%<review>Despite some inconsistent spelling of sherry terms on the exterior tube, Dingle is releasing some very good initial whiskeys. The nose brings dates, dried apricot and apple, haystacks, vanilla, unwaxed lemon, and cardamom pod. This second small batch release tastes fruity, with orange lollipops, a beautifully developed apricot note, and caramel, leading to a peak of gingerbread and pepper, followed by vanilla, toffee, and orange oil twisted from the peel. (6,000 bottles) €65"
2728,"<price>33<rating>88<whiskey>West Port IPA Cask-Finished, 40%<review>With Ireland’s proud heritage of brewing, no wonder distillers are experimenting: The barrels used here come courtesy of Blacks of Kinsale. The nose is subtle and delivers a fresh spiciness, with warm bread on a bakery shelf, stacked American oak staves, and a characteristic green hoppiness. Honey sweetness, citrus peel, lime zest, cereal, pepper, and ginger, then some late dark berry notes and fig before peppery spices thunder through the finish. (9,400 bottles)"
2729,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Old Scout Straight Bourbon (Batch #1), 49.5<review>A bit understated at first, this offers simple candy sweetness and burnt marshmallow aromas, along with citrus, dried apple, and cinnamon hearts candies that follow through on the palate with a hearty jolt of spice. The delicate wood and banana flavors, followed by a finish of cocoa and warming ginger, are well-crafted; however, the flavors are inhibited by searing alcohol that feels out of sync for a whiskey of this proof and stature."
2730,"<price>59<rating>86<whiskey>Timorous Beastie, 46.8%<review>This wee, sleekit, cow’rin, tim’rous beastie is a blended malt of Highland whiskies from Douglas Laing, the latest of their regional recipes to join Scallywag and Big Peat. Perfumed soaps in muslin bags, dried sprigs of heather, beeswax, and Edinburgh rock give this an intriguing bouquet. Juicy: mandarins glow with green plums and Granny Smith apples. Ripe, yellow fruits and spices mid-palate conclude with sweet malt and fading creaminess sweeping around the gums. Distinctive and laudable. £39"
2731,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Koval Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel 1,250), 47%<review>Certified organic, “aged under four years.” Oak is forward on the nose—young and fresh-sawn—with sweet spicy hard candies: cinnamon and teaberry. Juicy in the mouth: sweet, springing with that spice-fruit bounce off an oak board. Rye oil hides in the back, then slides forward with the oak to take over the finish. Dynamic. I haven't been a big Koval fan, but we're definitely on the right path here."
2732,"<price>260<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Tomintoul) cask 644 1967 vintage 40 year old, 49.4%<review>A deep, mature Tomintoul that manages to retain the elegance and drinkability found in younger Tomintoul whiskies. Roasted nuts, lush fruit, suggestions of cherry brandy and orange marmalade layered with rich fudge, toffee, and maple syrup. Soothing finish. Tomintoul can be a simple whisky at a younger age, but this one has matured into a beautifully complex dram. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)

2733,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 21 year old, 45.15%<review>One year older than last year’s 20 year old release, (which I felt was on the precipice of being over-oaked) and the extra year is evident. On the nose, the whiskey is nicely balanced. The palate tells a different story, with soft vanilla, honey, caramel, dried fruit, and cinnamon segueing into dominant leather, tobacco, and resinous oak on a long, dry finish. I fear bottling this whiskey annually, one year older, is going in the wrong direction."
2734,"<price>488<rating>91<whiskey>Oban, 2000 vintage, 58.7%<review>Matured in a sherry cask. Lush, with glazed citrus, caramelized peach, chewy toffee, roasted nuts, and subtle pine needles. The sherry is a driving force throughout this whisky, but it’s obviously from a very clean, polished European oak cask. Very delicious, with a long, satiating finish. Quite impressive for such a young whisky. My favorite of the bunch. (534 bottles) £300"
2735,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Weller Full Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 57%<review>Fragrant lemon and dried herbs on the nose, along with a sprinkling of powdered sugar and a hint of licorice. The palate offers deep notes of blackberry compote, tiramisu, and milk chocolate, all underpinned by earthy tones of cedar and polished oak. A rich symphony of flavor punctuates the long, impressive finish—mocha, almond, and cooked dark fruit, draped in notes of gooey caramel and pepper spice, set against balanced oak."
2736,"<price>95<rating>87<whiskey>Waterford Single Farm Origin Dunmore Edition 1.1, 50%<review>
Quite spicy up front, with pepper, ginger, and a touch of burnt spice, with Quaker Oatmeal Squares, dunnage floors, hazelnut, and slightly sour herbal notes of basil and tarragon. There’s a robust surge of pepperiness on the palate after an initial show of dark toffee, chocolate, and Americano, then it wallows in clove, cacao nibs, leather, Brazil nut, and baked fruits. (U.S. Exclusive; 13,000 bottles)"
2737,"<price>53<rating>88<whiskey>Balblair 2001, 46%<review>Balblair 2001 Vintage is the first distillery bottling to be non-chill filtered, noncolored, and offered at 46%. It is 10 years old and has been matured in ex-bourbon barrels. The nose offers lemonade, vanilla, allspice, and developing milk chocolate and caramel notes. Clean and straightforward on the palate; sweet and spicy, with tangerines, eating apples, toffee, and more milk chocolate. Cocoa powder in the spicy, relatively lengthy finish. £33"
2738,"<price>600<rating>92<whiskey>Glenglassaugh 37 year old, 56%<review>A first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask, exclusive to North America). Some of the old Glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious, and this is one of them. It's very clean, lush, and fruity (bramble, citrus, golden raisin), with a kiss of honey, toffee, and soft spice. Elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying. A very nice whisky from a quality cask that tastes more like 21 or 25 years old than 37. (I mean this in a good way.) "
2739,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>GlenAllachie 10 year old Cask Strength (Batch 1), 57.1%<review>This is the first batch of the only cask-strength bottling in the lineup and was matured in a combination of American oak, Pedro Ximénez, oloroso, and virgin oak casks. The nose offers gingersnap, melon, and cocoa powder, becoming floral in time. Bright fresh fruits on the palate, notably apricot and mango, with honey. Drying slowly, with a sprinkling of black pepper. (2,400 bottles for U.S.)"
2740,"<price>100<rating>81<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Sonoma-Cutrer Finish, 45.2%<review>Finished in pinot noir barrels. A very fruit-forward whiskey. I love bourbon, and I love pinot noir, but the wine influence is very intense and, to me, the flavors don’t integrate well. Cherries, red raspberry, and red currant dominate, along with a coating of caramel. Cinnamon and clove struggle to emerge from underneath it all. Sweet, fruity finish. Bonus points for uniqueness, but a bit overdone with the wine influence."
2741,"<price>3104<rating>87<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 40 year old, 41.7%<review>Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side. £1,999"
2742,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Collingwood 21 year old Rye, 40%<review>In 2013, the cavernous warehouses of the Canadian Mist distillery in Collingwood, Ontario gave up a single fifty-barrel batch of 100% malted rye. It had been resting there since 1991. Sweet, with the familiar flavors of rye bread, a juicy, joyful thrum burbles to a silken smooth surface before diving deep again only to rebound with warming spices, white pepper, and a pithy citrus pull. Indulgently creamy, Collingwood 21 defines “smooth.” Rich, flavorful, and oh, so mellow."
2743,"<price>12<rating>84<whiskey>Zackariah Harris, 40%<review>Florals and fruit begin a soft and delicate journey. For such a light whiskey, it’s certainly heavy on cherries, stone fruit, apples, and marmalade, followed by toffee, coffee, bananas, and chocolate. A drop of water shows how delicate it is, and the short finish suggests this whiskey would be leaps and bounds better with ten more degrees of proof."
2744,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Teerenpeli Portti Single Malt, 43%<review>This impressive whisky lets the port lead the dance, but never treads on the toes of its partner. The nose reveals prominent cask influences of pomegranate, inky plum flesh, blackberry, and gummy cherries, with a supporting cast of honeycomb, dried herbs, and bay leaf. It jinks and dodges between dried peel, fudge, baked orange, vanilla, and fine spice notes before developing into a sweet ripe cherry and red apple finale."
2745,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Green Spot Château Léoville Barton, 46%<review>Mitchell & Son’s classic whiskey finished for 1 to 2 years in wine casks formerly used by the Barton family in the St-Julien appellation. Spiced apple, redcurrant, blushing pink young raspberries, with a deeper earthiness, like a hedgerow run wild. An autumnal character: apple, rhubarb, ginger, piquant fruits, more vanilla, then a finish of sweetened apple and peppercorns. A definite imprint from the higher-strength pot still. It feels like the wine has shaped, sculpted, and finessed the whisky beautifully. À votre santé!"
2746,"<price>150<rating>85<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Longmorn) 1966, 43%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Walnut Aroma: Richly sherried and thick, with notes of nuts and toffee. Wood resins contribute spice and variety. Fruitcake at Christmas. Palate: Thick, chewy in texture, and quite ripe. Again the fruitcake. Very deep and mature with some underlying maltiness. Dry, spicy, oak notes fight off all that sherry and add balance and complexity. Long, soothing finish.

2747,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Wild Turkey 101, 50.5%<review>Cotton candy, campfire smoke, cinnamon, pilsner beer, butterscotch, and vanilla start a whiskey conversation that’s about balance, easy sipping, and the pursuit of spice. Around mid-palate, a plethora of baking spices—clove, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, and allspice—charms the senses. It’s set up to be a great run, but the approach softens toward the finish with muted brown sugar appearing. Still, the flavor and balance make for a fun sipper and great cocktail mixer."
2748,"<price>81<rating>88<whiskey>Talisker 2003 Amoroso Finish Distillers Edition, 45.8%<review>This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55"
2749,"<price>37<rating>83<whiskey>Cody Road Rye (Batch 5), 40%<review>A 100% rye whiskey, made from rye grown about 30 miles from Mississippi River Distilling. Strongly spicy and oily rye character reaching out of the glass and grabbing my nose; some surprising pastry and molasses notes hiding in there. The 40% mildness is disappointing at first, but develops into a spicy, minty mouth-filler with a cleanly sweet finish. On the sweet side, would prefer it drier."
2750,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Firestone & Robertson TX Experimental Series Rye, 63.07%<review>

Full-bodied and dense with aroma and flavor, this benefits from a few drops of water to unlock notes that are buried under the proof. Mint toothpaste, allspice, and cinnamon dominate the nose until water reveals sugared almonds, milk chocolate, and vanilla. The palate is heavy on charred flavors—roasted nuts and grilled meat—that turn to sweet blackened marshmallow and coffee bean when water is added. Peppery charred oak with an undercurrent of cooling mint rounds out the finish."
2751,"<price>117<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Girvan) 25 year old 1989, 51.5%<review>From the most westerly grain distillery in Scotland comes this wee charmer, offering coconut fondant, galia melon, fresh cream, and a pleasing, fragrant foliage note (walking through dense reed beds in early summer). A big, juicy dram with citrus, tropical fruits, and dabs of white pepper heat. The creaminess builds as dilution occurs, then it reaches a natural plateau and hits cruise. An intensely tangy and long finish of dried fruits. (232 bottles) £81"
2752,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Talisker 25 year old (2009 Release), 54.8%<review>Comes across initially to me as reserved, perhaps even elegant for a Talisker. Soothing too, with an oily texture. Quite fruity (orange, tangerine, apricot), perhaps even floral, with a delicate pastry sweetness. Then the more traditional Talisker notes kick in -- brine, seaweed, warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. A high-quality Talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. I love the oily, viscous texture."
2753,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Bulleit Blenders' Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch 001), 50%<review>The nose shows great maturity, with varnish, leather couch, black cherry syrup, dark chocolate, and wet walnuts. There’s a pleasant tartness to the palate, like just-ripe cherries, along with the richness of chocolate torte, blackberry jam, birch syrup, Concord grape jelly, and leathery oak. It finishes with lengthy cherry syrup, high-end dark chocolate, and more varnish and leather. Editor's Choice"
2754,"<price>236<rating>93<whiskey>Big Peat 25 year old, 52.1%<review>Peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. The mellow, sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It’s like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges, Sweethearts, flashes of citrus, stewed apple, and growing smoke. The gentle, glossy, mouth-coating finish generates an urge to expertly puff smoke rings out through pursed lips. (300 bottles) £175"
2755,"<price>8417<rating>91<whiskey>Port Ellen Untold Stories 40 year old 9 Rogue Casks, 50.9%<review>Faint smoke on the nose, with orange and malt. Floral notes in time, plus nougat.
More orange, and star anise on the palate, with overt woodsmoke, old leather, and
developing dark chocolate. The finish is long and lightly smoky. (1,380 bottles) £6,500"
2756,"<price>170<rating>90<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2015 Release), 63.95%<review>The Angel’s Envy Cask Strength port cask finished bourbon has developed a cult following, and it’s easy to see why. Jumping out are marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, roasted nuts, with a hint of cardamom, coffee, and nutmeg, but true beauty lies in the pronounced pumpkin pie, dark chocolate, raw pine nut, caramel, and sweet maltiness. I’d love for this whiskey to finish longer, but it does give a hint of nutmeg toward the end. Sourced whiskey."
2757,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Ben Nevis, 10 year old, 46%<review>Antique gold. Aromas of toffee, malty sweetness, fresh mint and subtle oak. Mouth coating, creamy texture-almost chewy-with flavors of toffee, almonds, dark chocolate, and subtle wood spices on the finish. This is a very pleasing, straightforward whisky that is quite mature for its age."
2758,"<price>45<rating>77<whiskey>Arizona Distilling Desert Durum Wheat, 46%<review>Extremely dark color; aged in ten-gallon barrels. A thick burbling nose, full of dark aromas: smoke, molasses, earth, and moist tobacco, with a sharp woody twist around the outside. The mouth recapitulates much of that, but in a brighter fashion…and then the small barrel takes over; tight, intense wood that blows out everything else and leaves the tongue tingling. I find it hard to tease out any spirit character; what’s this whiskey taste like under the wood?"
2759,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Arran Malt Amarone Wine Finish, 50%<review>This 2017 edition is non-chill filtered and finished in Amarone dry Italian red wine casks. Slightly perfumed on the nose, with a suggestion of madeira, plus malt and ripe pears. Viscous in the mouth; earthy, with plum and dry blackcurrant, black coffee, and plain chocolate, balanced by notes of honey. Mouth-drying in the finish, with a touch of tannic oak."
2760,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft Soft Red Wheat, 45%<review>Confectionary goodies all around. Vanilla, caramel with milk and chocolates: dark, Mexican, sweet, and white. Lots of chocolate. It’s soft and gentle, with zero spice, only rich chocolate and caramel with hints of grain and fruit, but this richness cannot be overstated. If you love chocolate and caramel, this is your dream bourbon. It finishes long and strong with a hint of—you guessed it—chocolate. Price is per 375ml"
2761,"<price>122<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts The Highland Mariner (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 46%<review>This Clynelish was matured in a refill hogshead and has been released as part of Wemyss Malts’ Single Cask Releases series. The nose yields light caramel, ozone, warm tweed, and soft ginger. Smooth and supple on the palate; soft spices, tangerines, and subtle, spicy oak. Chili notes on the relatively long finish. (341 bottles) £85"
2762,"<price>131<rating>89<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt, Mizunara Wood Reserve (bottled 2010), 46%<review>The Ichiro of the title is Ichiro Akuto, scion of the family which owned the now demolished Hanyu distillery, and proprietor of the brand new and incredibly cute (yes…distilleries can be cute) Chichibu distillery — even the name’s cute.
This release is a vatting of different (un-named) single malts from more than one distillery which have been aged in Japanese oak (mizunara, or Q.Mongolica). Mizunara has a highly distinctive aromatic spectrum — the Japanese say that it smells of temples, specifically the incense which scents Zen temples, but while totally accurate, that’s not much help if you haven’t been to one. Think of a heavy, exotic aroma of allspice, sandalwood, even redwood, and you’re almost there. In fact, if you think of the perfumed aspects of rye, but turned up a notch, then you’re in the right ballpark. In this one there’s even a hint of trail bar — maybe it’s a hike in a California old-growth forest.
The palate is soft and slow to start, then picks up mouthwatering acidity — there’s that rye parallel. Green plum and peach, balanced with spiciness on the end. Once encountered, never forgotten. £85. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
2763,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection Barrel Finished 10 year old, 50%<review>Heaven Hill’s first wood-finished bourbon. Finished for several months in cognac casks (reminiscent of Beam’s Distillers’ Masterpiece offering around a decade ago), which show nicely without dominating. Very silky and smooth in texture. Notes of graham cracker, dark fleshy fruit (ripe grape, blackberry brandy), light toffee, maple syrup on pancakes, and creamy vanilla. Great balance, distinctive, and perilously drinkable for 100 proof."
2764,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Soldier Valley True American 6 Bourbon, 45%<review>Bright with lemon and lime, as well as gardenias and peonies—a fresh garden on the nose; there’s also uncooked corn on the cob, mint toothpaste, tea leaf, and pecan shell. The palate is spiced and oak-forward, countered by grape jelly, dark chocolate, coffee bean, and hints of tobacco. It’s occasionally jumbled, even into the finish, which has roasted pecans, pipe tobacco, leather, and black pepper."
2765,"<price>37<rating>80<whiskey>Ontario Wheat Batch 2, 50%<review>This is the latest in an ongoing series of organic, single-field white whiskies from Toronto distillery. In 2013, summer rains imbued Ontario spring wheat with softer, nuttier, and more complex flavors than 2012. These show here on the nose as lemon oil, fragrant spring violets, and newly harvested grain. A sweet, spicy palate is alive with real lemons, yellow plums, fresh straw, and sweet, lingering white pepper. Mouth coating and big. (Ontario only) C$40/375 ml."
2766,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Breuckelen 77 Bonded Rye, 50%<review>Part of Breuckelen Distilling’s Bonded Series, this rye starts with fresh wood and some candied fruit on the nose, as well as vanilla frosting, lemon, and cigar wrapper. The palate is somewhat oak-driven, with emerging fruit flavors of peach, apricot, and juicy orange. A strong finish has notably good length and reveals more flavors of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, black cherries, licorice, and gentle wood spices."
2767,"<price>162<rating>90<whiskey>Lagavulin 18 year old Fèis Ìle (2016 Release), 49.5%<review>It’s been quite a year for Lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). This was a 6,000-strong bottling, aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. Initially restrained and mildly oxidized, it shows angelica, a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp, then fennel pollen and water mint. The smoke is pulled back. The palate has orchard fruits, creosote, and moss. Lagavulin’s top notes accentuated, but with the depth of age. £125"
2768,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Chicken Cock Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Banana peel, pencil shavings, florist’s shop, and rose garden lined with herb beds on the nose. Oak takes the lead on the palate, but is tempered by lemon and orange zest, sweet black licorice, chocolate, peanuts, and popcorn. Crushed peanuts, milk chocolate, and pencil shavings persist on the finish, although it’s fairly short."
2769,"<price>127<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 1993 Islay Jazz Festival bottling (2011 Release), 55.4%<review>An extremely limited edition issued at last year’s Islay Jazz Fest, this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page XX for more on the ‘bodega’ process). It is, simply, massive, with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers, burning rosemary, fig, coffee, and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot, earth, and a rolling wave of deep, pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent. (Distillery only) £80"
2770,"<price>57<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie 15 year old, 43%<review>Deep gold color. This whisky is finished off in new oak, and it certainly shows. There are lots of complex wood spices in this whisky, and it is intensely deep and mature for such a young age. There’s a firmness to the whisky that’s very appealing. It is exciting too, with notes of toasted oak, vanilla, and a hint of dark chocolate."
2771,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Provenance (distilled at Inchgower), 14 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%<review>Technically a Speyside whisky, but it tastes more like a coastal Northern Highlander. The foundation of this whisky is a lovely honeyed maltiness. It is aged in a sherry cask, which provides layers of rich toffee, caramel, and orange marmalade. Brisk sea salt notes emerge on the palate keeping the whisky fresh and quite lively-the coastal influence-while deft seaweed and spice add complexity. 
"
2772,"<price>2200<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1979 (Distilled at Glenlivet; Cask No. 19237), 54%<review>The nose yields tangerines, linseed, marzipan, ginger, and honey, followed by a mild menthol note. Rounded and chewy on the palate, with lively orchard fruit flavors, turning to slightly bitter Seville orange and light chile. Licorice root and tannins develop in the very long, citric finish. (62 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
2773,"<price>140<rating>94<whiskey>The Dalmore Stillman's Dram 28 Year Old, 45%<review>For the past several years, the Stillman’s Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. In this instance, I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky’s trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman’s Dram in years."
2774,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2009 Release), 58%<review>Deeper and darker than some Four Roses, but with plenty of bright, lush sweetness. Notes of toffee, honey-drenched nuts, and ripe summer fruit. Nicely spiced, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dusting of mocha. I just love the honey influence. A well-balanced whiskey, with all the flavors taking turns to shine. Great integration of flavors, too! One of my favorite Four Roses single barrel bourbons, which will grow on you with every sip."
2775,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Trail’s End, 45%<review>An 8 year old Kentucky straight bourbon finished in Oregon oak that apparently brings about vanilla cake batter, caramel, hints of coffee, and citrus. Soft and delicate to the taste, with exploding French toast notes, cinnamon, allspice, and a hint of blueberry jam. The finish comes and goes, but leaves an impressive watermelon Jolly Rancher-cinnamon combo at the end. This one is meant to be sipped without the addition of water or ice. Sourced whiskey."
2776,"<price>26<rating>87<whiskey>Trader Joe’s 10 year old Highland, 40%<review>Saline and earthy on the nose, lifted up by green apple, Juicy Fruit gum, and mango. A pleasant smokiness—more cigar wrapper than peat—wafts through the palate’s juicy roundness of mango, green apple, and Red Vines. More tobacco leaf and toasted oak on the finish. (Trader Joe’s)"
2777,"<price>43<rating>89<whiskey>Milam & Greene Triple Cask Blend of Straight Bourbons, 47%<review>Blending a 2 year old straight bourbon made at Ben Milam Distillery with two Tennessee straight bourbons (one aged 3 to 4 years and the other 10 to 11 years), this whiskey balances youth and maturity adeptly. The nose has peanuts, cinnamon hot chocolate, horehound candy, and Coca-Cola syrup, while on the palate, orange, cherries, blueberries, blackberries, peanuts, pepper, allspice, and cinnamon are held in balance by the oak. The finish rides a good length with chili-chocolate, roasted peanuts, oak, and a hint of tobacco leaf."
2778,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>FEW Italia, 46.5%<review>Super floral with bright lemon and yuzu, this beams with originality, as violet candies, rose petal, and pine forest join the fray. The mouthfeel has a satisfying oily texture and a slightly tart, bright citrus lift before the creamy sweetness settles in, nicely balanced with drying oak tannins."
2779,"<price>10<rating>85<whiskey>Clan MacGregor, 40%<review>Banana chips, peppercorn, coriander stalks, dry grasses, cracker bread, faint lemon zest, butterscotch, and green apple; more grain than malt character evident. With watery citrus, butterscotch, walnut, lemon peel, and caramel initially, it’s lighter-bodied but balanced. It develops more spices and a fine texture as it dilutes, lifted by cinnamon, caramel, and gentle spices. Overlook the hard-to-love nose, and this is tasty both neat and over ice."
2780,"<price>125<rating>84<whiskey>Millstone 2004 Barrel Proof Rye 10 year old (cask #667), 58.6%<review>Hard toffee, Brazil nut, milk chocolate, and noticeable rye bread aromas on the nose from this new American oak barrel. The rye spiciness is embedded with the other flavors; balanced, but not dominant. Soft and fudgey flavors display sparkling spices, deeper toffee notes, vanilla, and cinnamon bark. Try a dash of water to unlock the sweetness and citrus elements below the surface. If anything, this accentuates the tobacco and spiciness of the finish (The Whisky Exchange only) £85"
2781,"<price>209<rating>88<whiskey> Balblair 18 year old, 46%<review>Like its 15 year old sibling, this was matured in bourbon casks before being finished in first-fill European oak butts. The spicy nose yields toffee, sherry, and poached pears. The palate is supple, spicy, and slightly herbal, with dried fruits, then big caramel, vanilla, and orange notes develop. The finish is quite dry and earthy, with oak and a hint of chile."
2782,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Timorous Beastie 24 year old, 46.8%<review>Coconut macaroon, baked sweet pastries, peach purée, sanded oak, Starburst chews, pear, caramel shortbread, strands of orange zest, and crushed allspice and coriander seeds. Far from timorous, this grown-up Highlander has the heart of a lion, with flavors of cooked apple, dark molasses, vanilla pod, lots of oak tannin, pepper, and coriander seed, with a finish of dark sugars and peppery heat. Quite an animal. (828 bottles for the U.S.)"
2783,"<price>108<rating>89<whiskey>Lp4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Laphroaig), 54.8%<review>A very tarry start, like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. Add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass, and you have all the requisite elements for a classic Laphroaig. The palate is massively smoky to start, a real peat bomb, but that eruption recedes, allowing barley and sweetness to come through. This is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. Very good. £65/500 ml"
2784,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Adnams Single Malt, 40%<review>A heady mix of floral notes and soft fruits, with fresh cereal notes and aromas of sweet pea, orange honey, apricot, and papaya on this French oak-matured whisky. This begins gracefully as a soft, creamy single malt with flavors of vanilla caramel and condensed milk, becoming denser with scrumptious biscuit and chocolate flavors (think Twix bars) as it slowly reveals its secrets."
2785,"<price>32<rating>86<whiskey>Pike Creek, 40%<review>This export-only Pike Creek reminds us of the year-to-year differences we can expect from whisky that spends Canada’s brutal winters (and sweltering summers) in unheated warehouses. Slightly younger than the Canada-only version, this is just different enough to be its own whisky. Gingery hot pepper laces its way through sweet, ripe red fruit as vague menthol with a slight herbal edge slips gently into silky oak tannins. Finishes cleanly with a citrus pithiness. "
2786,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Tullibardine 20 year old, 43%<review>This 20 year old expression of Tullibardine has been aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, like its younger stablemate Sovereign. Caramel, honey, cocoa, and a hint of linseed oil on the nose. The palate is creamy, with strawberries, warm milk chocolate, and allspice. Long and soft in the finish, which is reminiscent of choc-ice. At 20, this single malt has gained in richness and sophistication, with an extremely enticing flavor profile."
2787,"<price>274<rating>84<whiskey>Bowmore The Devil’s Casks III, 56.7%<review>Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190"
2788,"<price>46<rating>90<whiskey>Driftless Glen Bourbon, 48%<review>Orange, lemon peel, iced tea, cinnamon, and blueberry jam aromas are undercut by earthy notes of mulch, chili powder, cracked corn, and dill. Oak leads the flavor parade, but is well-tempered by raspberry, pomegranate, cinnamon, orange, licorice, walnuts, and black pepper. Chocolate, more pomegranate, chili powder, and silky oak round out this lush bourbon, which shows impressive maturity for its 2 years."
2789,"<price>34<rating>88<whiskey>The Chita, 43%<review>Suntory built Chita Distillery in 1972 to produce a diverse range of corn-based grain whisky styles. This single grain has bright, floral aromas with light honey, orange and lemon peel, freshly unwrapped bubble gum, rose water, and an edge of spice. Clean, pure, and moreish, this high-quality whisky showcases lychee, citrus, banana, and honey, with herbal fringes and a juicy finish. Oh, and it’s terrific on the rocks. JP¥3,800"
2790,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Caol Ila 15 year old, 61.5%<review>Unpeated Caol Ilas have become a regular in the Special Releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear. The early nose is reticent and faintly floral, with freshly sliced green apples. Sharp and sweet on the palate, with malt and citrus fruit, and even a hint of mint. Ginger, mixed nuts, aniseed, and more mint in the medium-length finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling."
2791,"<price>21<rating>81<whiskey>Ballantine’s Finest, 40%<review>A pleasant nose of light caramel, dried orange rind, butterscotch, sweet grain, and a lick of bonfire smoke, yet it’s like the volume has been dialed down to three. Delicate, to the point of shyness. Sweet barley, concentrated orange, a low rumble of spice, and the grain sings through. Accessible, well structured, and light-textured, leading to a finish of brown sugar around the gums, although it has a stronger grain character than many in its price range."
2792,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg Airidh Nam Beist 1990 Vintage, 46%<review>Some of the best intensely smoky, peaty Islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This whisky is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke, peat, tarry rope, and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt, ripe vanilla, chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate, along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed."
2793,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1991 vintage, 19 year old, 45%<review>Quite bold and crisply spicy. The most palate-piercing of the three. Well defined flavors of cool mint, warming cinnamon, honey-kissed fruit, and caramel. Briskly spicy finish. When I nose this whiskey, it feels like it’s brandishing a sword at me and shouting “en garde!”"
2794,"<price>129<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Toffee Tuile (distilled at Aberfeldy) 1999, 46%<review>Following on from another 1999 single cask Aberfeldy in the previous batch of Wemyss Malts’ releases, we have Toffee Tuile, matured in a hogshead. The nose is sweet and approachable, with tinned fruit cocktail, vanilla, malt, and fresh ginger. Tropical fruit, brittle toffee, hazelnuts, a hint of caramel, and more ginger on the nose. The finish is medium in length, fruity, and mildly spicy. (393 bottles) £88"
2795,"<price>300<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Breton 21 year old (cask 665), 43%<review>Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Glenora distillery has certainly hit its stride. This clean, grassy 21 year old tastes like nothing so much as a top Speyside scotch. Fresh hay notes and a slightly effervescent spiciness give the feel, but not the taste, of hot black licorice. Barrel notes begin to show in the middle, resolving into a long, peppery, pithy finish. Barrel selected by Mike Brisebois for Casker’s whisky club. Good stuff, Glenora! (Distillery only) "
2796,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Doc.52 Blended Straight Whiskey, 56%<review>Not a hair out of place here. On the nose, there are cooked bananas and poached pears with a wave of spices—allspice, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and mace—as well as iced tea, orange peel, and the distinct aromas of a tobacco barn. The chewy, oak-driven palate showcases blackberry jam, cooked cherries, peanut chews, Coca-Cola, ginger, allspice, dark chocolate, and sassafras. It all ends with robust oak and a silky, lengthy flavor of pecan-studded chocolate. 288 bottles"
2797,"<price>125<rating>93<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Château de Laubade Armagnac Barrel-Finished Bourbon, 59.2%<review>Thanks to its finishing casks, there are dried and syrupy fruits on the nose—cherry cordial candies, raisins, figs—along with sugared pecans, maple syrup, candied ginger, and leather. That finishing asserts itself even more strongly on the palate, which is fruity and sweet, becoming better integrated with water: cherries, blackberry and raspberry jams, figs, raisins, pecans, milk chocolate, ginger, white pepper, and coffee bean. Incredible length on the finish, with more dried fruit, leather, hazelnuts, ginger, and white pepper. (1,974 bottles)"
2798,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Hotel Tango American Whiskey, 45%<review>An American whiskey from Indianapolis-based Hotel Tango. The nose has notes of slate, herbs, tea, lemon peel, bitter orange, and vanilla wafer. The palate is somewhat green, with raisin, cinnamon candy, vanillin, grenadine, bitter chocolate, pecan, and cracked pepper. The finish is long and flavorful, offering orange, cherry, vanilla ice cream, mocha, and licorice. Perhaps too much wood influence, but water balances it well, creating a smooth, complex, and enjoyable whiskey."
2799,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Cutty Sark 18 year old, 43%<review>Cutty Sark lost its way in recent years; expect that to change soon. Its owners have plans to return it to glory (and to include a 30 year old among its expressions — you read it here first). For the time being — if you can find it — this 18 year old is a sublime mix of soft plum and peach, sweet, pure grain, easy-drinking vanilla, and a deft oakiness all delivered in gentle and harmonious fashion. Masterful blending."
2800,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Bondi Bourbon, 40%<review>Yes, this is named for the beach in Australia, and its light character might well be intended for seaside sipping. Orange blossom, lemon, and cinnamon gum vie with Popsicle stick on the nose. The light-bodied palate has more orange, cinnamon candy, nuttiness, and a lot of oak that becomes cloying on the finish. Overall, it has the effect of making one wish there were just a bit more body and character."
2801,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Broken Barrel Isle of Peat American Blended Whiskey, 55%<review>A blend of American single malt and wheat whiskeys, finished on staves from peated Islay scotch casks using Broken Barrel’s proprietary process. The effect is herbaceous rather than smoky; this has tons of eucalyptus, bay leaves, black pepper, and juniper—more like an amaro in aroma than a whiskey. Dry and lean in the mouth, there’s mint, black pepper, eucalyptus, cola spices, dark chocolate, licorice, and honeyed lemon tea. The finish is medium-length with oak, mint, pepper, and persistent herbs. Profoundly outside the box, but it works. (6,600 bottles)"
2802,"<price>130<rating>91<whiskey>Crown Royal XR (LaSalle), 40%<review>Vanilla and oak nose, with a creamy layer of mint that warns you: Rye Ahead. And what a sweet rye wave it is, rolling in with green mint and grass, more bourbony oak and vanilla, lively spice on the top (with enough heat to keep it bold), and a finish that brings everything together. Beautifully integrated, and not overly woody, a tribute to the blending art of Canadian distillers."
2803,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Barr An Uisce Wicklow Hills, 40%<review>Lemon drizzle cake and finely shredded orange peel on this Barr An Uisce first-fill bourbon cask-matured blend of 21% malt whiskey and 79% grain that has enjoyed a 3-month oloroso sherry finish. With light lemon, green melon, and flashes of citrus, it revs up the toffee and marzipan notes, ending with a pleasing, sweet swan song of caramel and white chocolate. A gentle dram for quiet times."
2804,"<price>125<rating>94<whiskey>Bardstown Bourbon Co. Copper & Kings Apple Brandy Barrel-Finished Bourbon 60.20%<review>Aromas of corn meal, corn muffins, and buttered toast on the nose, along with vanilla frosting, warm raspberry tart, nuttiness, and polished oak. A big palate offers baking spice, vanilla ice cream, blackberries, and coconut shavings. A long finish of rich caramel, chocolate, cracked pepper, and roasted coffee beans, is completed by a final note of cigar ash. Warm and inviting, as the sweetness melds gracefully with dark fruit and spice."
2805,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Westward Oregon Stout Cask-Finished American Single Malt, 45%<review>Tropical and floral on the nose, with kiwi, mango, hibiscus, coconut cream, and pistachio and almond halva; add water and a big burst of honeysuckle blooms. There are more tropical notes on the palate: melon, guava, pineapple, and Juicy Fruit, as well as almond, coffee ice cream, milk chocolate, and spice. The mouthfeel is robust, becoming mouthwatering on the finish, which is oak-led but balanced with floral hop character."
2806,"<price>200<rating>80<whiskey>Signatory 'Glencraig' (distilled at Glenburgie), 30 year old, 1975 vintage, Cask # 7938, 54.4%<review>This Glencraig, along with Mosstowie (reviewed below), were experimentations with ""Lomond"" stills, where the top of the stills were replaced with a rectifying column, allowing several different styles of whiskies to be produced at the same distillery. The Lomond stills were eventually removed. This is a very creamy malt, with an oily texture. Notes of bananas and cream, ripe barley, caramel, graham cracker, and orange creamsicle. Dry, spicy finish. The fruity zing in this whisky shows that it still has some life in it. A dessert whisky indeed. 
"
2807,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Reisetbauer 7 year old, 43%<review>The youngest offering has an attractive fruity nose with red apple, menthol, and wax candles, all nicely backed with spicy oak. Honey-dipped apple slices, citrus, chocolate-covered raisins, and very gentle spice make this a most agreeable sipping whisky. The finish has coffee grounds with a pinch of spice. Perfectly delicious, it’s just a little meek and light bodied, with a shorter flavor trajectory."
2808,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Tullibardine, 1992 Vintage, 46%<review>Fresh and clean, with notes of creamy barley, cut grass, coconut marshmallow, pencil shavings, and oatcake. Soft finish. Subtle spice dances about in the background. Bottling at 46% adds to the richness. A soothing whisky. 
"
2809,"<price>63<rating>89<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Leapfrog' 12 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1987, 46%<review>White wine color. Seaweed, briny aromas and flavors. The classic Laphroaig medicinal, pungent, smoky rush kicks in on the finish and stays in overdrive for a very long time."
2810,"<price>30<rating>84<whiskey>Dry Fly Straight Triticale, 44%<review>Triticale is a wheat/rye hybrid, which I guess appealed to the wheat-mad Dry Fly distillers. Aromas of grass, bubble gum, and oak. Taste is young, brashly sweet, but smooth enough to spread easily over the tongue. There’s spice—light cinnamon, a zip of allspice heat—and grassy brightness, but they’re dressing on the juicy sweet center. Not flawed, and well-made, but I wish it had more to say. Price is per 375ml.
"
2811,"<price>1700<rating>93<whiskey>Brora 34 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 51.9%<review>Distilled in 1982, this expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. It is the 16th Brora in the Special Releases series. Ripe pears and vanilla on the nose; progressively more perfumed, with developing toffee notes. Slightly waxy on the palate, with fresh-squeezed lemon and sweet background smoke contrasting with spicy dark berries. Plain chocolate, sultanas, and raisins in the medium-length finish. A relatively restrained Brora. (3,000 bottles)"
2812,"<price>60<rating>80<whiskey>St. George’s Chapter 9, 46%<review>The name’s a little misleading — this is actually the second whisky to be released from England’s only distillery. It’s only three years old so don’t expect too much depth, but it’s a significant step up from the first release, it’s made by legendary former Laphroaig distiller Iain Henderson and it’s peated, so expect a treat. There’s not much happening on the nose, with some fluffy fruit masking a touch of charcoal smoke. But on the palate it goes through the gears, with melon and pear giving way to a wave of licorice before the peat kicks in and stays. It’s a bit like seeing a talented teenager try out for a sports team: lots of talent, no obvious weaknesses, but not yet big enough to front up to the first team, and in need of some muscle. Nevertheless, surprisingly balanced and rounded, and a sign of good things to come. (Selected British whisky outlets.)"
2813,"<price>2850<rating>93<whiskey>Glenmorangie Pride 1981, 56.7%<review>Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1, 2011. Price is approximate."
2814,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box Enlightenment, 46%<review>This torchbearer for the Compass Box Scotch Whisky Transparency campaign is looking for your support. A fruit medley of lemon, lime, gooseberry cream, and soft pineapple chunks. Ripe apple and pear from the orchard are given a fresh, spicy lift and integrate with the vanilla and sweet toffee notes. It makes a clean exit with lengthy spices and juiciness, never becoming bitter. One thing is clear, it’s a finely structured dram worthy of your vote. (5,922 bottles)"
2815,"<price>989<rating>90<whiskey>Cutty Sark Art Deco Limited Edition 33 year old, 41.7%<review>Imagine sipping this sophisticated libation at the supper club turned out in your best bib and tucker. There’s a purity to it, with aromas of fresh red apples, raisins in honey, ground cinnamon, and nutmeg, leading to bitter orange oils and a storm of black pepper fading to tropical fruit, layered caramel, and sugared almonds. Hold this long in the mouth, as it possesses a changing, multi-faceted character. As Cab Calloway said, “This is Hep.” (3,456 bottles) £650"
2816,"<price>320<rating>89<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 2), 56.3%<review>This has more vanilla and caramel, with less aggressive wood spices than Tree 1, and aromas of clove, sharpened pencils, and dried morel mushrooms. It’s fruity and mouth-drawing, yet less weighty than Tree 1, reminiscent of fruit Life Savers and baked apple, and when it peaks it breaks with more alcohol than spice."
2817,"<price>400<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach 30 year old 1976 vintage (Cask #4469), 55.5%<review>Beautifully clean and polished on the palate -- it still allows BenRiach’s other flavors to shine through. Ripe, complex tropical fruit notes meld with delicate honey and suggestions of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut. Teasing peat and smoke surfaces from time to time. This whisky is a lot of fun to drink. (800 bottles total; 120 for the U.S.)"
2818,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Corsair Buckwheat Bourbon, 50%<review>Is buckwheat a grain, seed, or nut? Doesn’t matter: you can malt it, so Corsair put it in their rye bourbon as a fourth…whatever. Aromas of corn, vanilla, and teaberry, with a pleasant broadness and light herbal notes. There’s a nutty note to the sweet corn and vanilla, and a move in the direction of astringency, but it’s intriguing, a definite plus. The layered finish has a woody nip to it, that dry earthiness, and sweet corn."
2819,"<price>66<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Dailuaine) 10 year old, 46%<review>Dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose, as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. There’s a glimpse of sweetness, a little fruit, but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). The palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. Is it commercial? Probably not, but it tells a really important story. I like it a lot. £45"
2820,"<price>34<rating>80<whiskey>Wigle Malted Rye, 46%<review>Another experimental “Whims” bottlings; this one is 95% malted rye and 5% malted barley. Nose is sharp, with notes of cinnamon candies and a bit of solvents. Better on the palate: a cooling breeze of minty rye, some citrus, and growing bitter rye oil as it finishes. Fairly simple, pleasant stuff, but the nose is not inviting. Price is per 375 ml."
2821,"<price>85<rating>83<whiskey>BenRiach Arumaticus 12 year old, 46%<review>Finished in a dark rum cask. Notes of peat, smoked mackerel, and suggestions of charcoal married with molasses, vanilla wafer, golden raisin, cantaloupe, and a dollop of honey. It’s missing the more defined fruit notes that the other two have. I’d like to see this at 15 years to give it more depth."
2822,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Ironroot Hubris Straight Corn (2018 Edition), 58.9%<review>Earthy, smoky, and sweet, with aromas of chili-dusted dried mango, barbecue potato chips, brown sugar, mesquite smoke, and fruit-flavored pipe tobacco, as well as pinesap and leather. Hefty in weight, with powerful oak and earthy flavors, including tobacco leaf, espresso bean, mesquite-grilled meat, and orange. There are roasted nuts, minerality, dark chocolate, and cigar wrapper on the finish. Add water generously without any fear of diluting this benevolent bruiser."
2823,"<price>435<rating>90<whiskey>Celtic Cask Cúig 1991, 46%<review>Despite the vintage statement, this is 13 year old single pot still matured in first-fill bourbon. Apparently, it was MIA for eight years before being bottled. Peeled apples, crackerbread, Quaker oats, ripening pears, cappuccino sprinkles, and lightly toasted spices make for a well-composed and inviting prospect. Enveloping and oily with tarte aux pommes, fruit polos, allspice, and ground ginger. After a brief effervescent fizzle, it expands to become creamier and the spices carry on long after you have swallowed. €350"
2824,"<price>123<rating>87<whiskey>Hazelburn 9 year old Barolo Cask, 57.9%<review>Distilled in June 2007 and bottled in October 2016, this expression spent 6 years in first-fill bourbon casks, then 3 years in Barolo wine casks. Fresh on the early nose; herbaceous, with pineapple and a hint of oil. Big in the mouth, with white pepper, more pineapple, dried fruits, and coconut milk. Drying to tannins, with dark berries in the lengthy, minty finish. (10,800 bottles)"
2825,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Armorik Classic, 46%<review>Elegant and dry, this Breton whisky from Distillerie Warenghem charms with its nose of digestive biscuits, honey, barley, dry oak, dried apricot, apple rings, roasted coriander seeds, and white pepper. The flavor delivery is well balanced with orange, honey, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and pepper, with the masterful spices quelling the fruitiness in the end. Breton is an endangered language, so pour a glass and raise a toast. Yec’hed mat!"
2826,"<price>155<rating>92<whiskey>Ardmore 100th Anniversary 12 year old, 40%<review>This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.
Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again.

2827,"<price>49<rating>91<whiskey>Alberta Premium Cask Strength, 65.1%<review>Strong barrel tones on the nose enhanced by mint, bread-and-butter pickles, and prunes. A floral palate is hot, slippery, and quite sweet, with restrained barrel tones, roses, mild menthol, sweet rummy molasses, and brilliant peppery spices in the middle. Later sips show slightly sour orange juice. Finishes with hot spices and vaguely bitter pith. $65 CAD"
2828,"<price>125<rating>89<whiskey>Cadenhead<review>Antique gold color. Aromas of peat smoke, damp earth, exotic pepper, vanilla, and fruit. Medium body. A great balance of flavors, with a lovely Islay character. The whisky begins sweet up front, ultimately turning pleasingly dry towards the finish. In between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke, vanilla, spicy pepper, and delicately honeyed malt, with just a hint of the sea. What I like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity, sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its Islay roots without smothering its other flavors."
2829,"<price>350<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 32 year old 1973 Vintage (Cask #8375), 41.3%<review>An essay in elegance. Silky and soft in texture, and very clean. Notes of peaches and cream, vanilla wafer, soft honey and fruit gum drops. Subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple, lemon, coconut), demerara sugar, heather, and anise. Polished oak adds structure and contrast, with a very elegant finish. Hard to believe this whisky is 32 years old. It's lighter and more elegant than the equally splendid Highland Park 30 year old, which I rated a 94 in the last issue. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
2830,"<price>2500<rating>88<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail 125th Anniversary 1984 (Distilled at Glenury Royal; Cask No. 2335), 49.1%<review>
Royal Glenury was established in 1825 and closed in 1985. Salted butter on the early nose, Turkish delight, then dry nutty sherry. Very nutty on the palate, with figs and wine tannins. The lengthy finish reveals dates, bitter coffee, and black treacle. (397 bottles, 38 for U.S.)"
2831,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Coppersea Green Malt Rye, 45%<review>Made with green malt: not kilned, taken just as it’s ready from malting to be fermented and distilled, timing that accounts for some of the price and limited availability of this unique spirit. Smells like a shed full of drying herbs and flowers; vegetal souls transmigrated to the bottle. Herbal, European, restrained barrel character, headily vaporous in the mouth. An invigorating elixir I’d like to keep handy in a small flask; a little goes a long way. Fascinatingly different. Price is per 375 ml."
2832,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Mortlach), 22 year old, 1982 vintage, 43%<review>Toffee and nougat, with a lacing of cotton candy. It then turns richly nutty-almost chewy-with notes of dried apricot, sultana, and a touch of red currant. Firm, dry, oak resin finish. A well-structured whisky, indicative of the Mortlach pedigree. 
"
2833,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Balcones 1 Texas (Batch SM 20-1), 53%<review>Dried leaves, toasted nuts, and plenty of fresh oak emerge from this big, broad-shouldered malt that ably handles all the new oak that’s been thrown at it, with the solid wood structure propping up pretty orange pekoe tea, buttered toast, biscuity malt, caramel, and chocolate flavors. Finishes with dark toasted spices and anise. A distinctly oaky, American interpretation of single malt that is both bold and balanced. (5,000 bottles)"
2834,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay (distilled 2008, bottled 2011), 50%<review>The only Islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — Kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling, and this limited edition release uses locally grown Optic barley malted at the distillery. Very creamy, with some stewed apple, green banana, and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. The smoke develops on the palate, adding an earthy note. Rich, with some clove and licorice on the finish. Well worth a look. "
2835,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Wild Turkey Rare Breed, 58.4%<review>Cotton candy, marshmallows roasting over an open campfire, baked apples, and cornbread batter start a whiskey that then offers hints of caramel apples, pumpkin pie, and roasted pecans. Water opens it up to more nuanced fruit, spice, and sweetness. Without water, brown-sugar butter dominates about mid-palate and leads to a long finish. Dilution makes this a completely different whiskey experience."
2836,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Royal Canadian, 40%<review>Very clean, elegant, and well-rounded, with honey-kissed fruit, vanilla, and subtle spice. Very versatile. I would normally drink a whisky like this on the rocks or use it as a mixer. But, in a pinch, I could drink it neat."
2837,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Forty Creek 2014 Evolution, 43%<review>A new direction for Forty Creek’s 8th annual release, which was aged 3 years, redistilled, then aged another 9 years. Quintessentially Canadian, it begins with Caramac candy bar, finishing in white pepper and bitter grapefruit pith. Not as lush as past releases, although the flavors remain a tightly woven panoply of fruit, spices, vegetal notes, and citrus zest. Gooseberries and lime on the nose become black currants on the palate as increasing hints of red wine come to dominate."
2838,"<price>26<rating>83<whiskey>Pendleton 10 year old Blended Canadian Whisky, 40%<review>Fruity on the nose and palate (orange peel, lime, lemon, pineapple). Very smooth and creamy, too, with notes of vanilla and a touch of honey. Underlying brittle mint, delicate floral notes, and even a hint of sandalwood gives the whisky some dimension. Very clean and nicely rounded. The problem with many Canadian whiskies is that they are too harsh when young, but get too woody when aged for ten or more years, because they are too thin in body to stand up to the oak. This one has matured nicely while still maintaining good balance and drinkability."
2839,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Matsui The Peated, 48%<review>Kurayoshi Distillery lies between Osaka and Hiroshima in the foothills of Mount Daisen, where it produces single malt whiskies brought to proof with soft, mountain spring water. The label, adorned by Hokusai’s The Great Wave, portends this whisky’s rush of flavor: satisfyingly smoky, with noticeable structure and complexity. Kippers on the nose, with burnt aromatic grasses, cocoa, and jellied fruits, and a smoky palate of red apple, ginger, pepper, orange, and mango. Smoke writhes like a serpent on the finish, sliding off the walls dripping with sweet tropical fruits. Number 19 in the 2019 Top 20 "
2840,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Crown Royal Noble Collection Wine Barrel Finished, 40.5%<review>The first expression of the Crown Royal Noble Collection was our Canadian Whisky of the Year in 2016 and this one outdoes the original. This release features the standard Crown Royal Fine De Luxe finished in cabernet sauvignon barrels.  To an already complex blend of vanilla, delicate flowers, and fruits, add canned peach syrup, pears, and white plums, with smoldering pepper and grape skin tannins on the finish."
2841,"<price>39<rating>88<whiskey>Hunter Laing & Co. Scarabus, 46%<review>An upfront classic single malt from an undisclosed Islay distillery, launched to coincide with the opening of Hunter Laing’s Ardnahoe Distillery. Overt peat smoke on the nose, with brine, citrus spices, vanilla, and mild antiseptic. Stewed fruits and bonfire embers on the palate, with new leather and rich spice notes. The slightly medicinal finish features peppery oak."
2842,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Canadian Club Sherry Cask (batch C12-224), 41.3%<review>Hard to find Harvey’s Bristol Cream sherry casks are the secret of this big fruity whisky, and also the reason it varies among batches. Rumors that Sherry Cask will be discontinued in the U.S. are true, so stock up now. Otherwise, be prepared for some cross-border shopping in Canada, where it will continue to be available. The sweet sherry influence is obvious in ripe dark currants, golden raisins, and dates. A Brio-like nuttiness gives way to hot pepper."
2843,"<price>62<rating>88<whiskey>Label 5 Extra Rare 18 year old, 40%<review>Rather elegant blend, with aromas of woodworker’s bench, salted cashew, and dried banana chips, all backed by gentle bonfire smoke. Creamy caramel toffee, Victoria sponge, red currant, raspberry, and more oak build into a thick, luscious mouthful. Any smoke drifts away in the initial seconds. Toffee and fruit linger, making a very lengthy finish. A masterful top of the range blend from La Martinquaise. Well worth seeking out. €55"
2844,"<price>90<rating>81<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Littlemill), 1991 vintage, 16 year old, 46%<review>rather soft whisky, with gently sweet notes of vanilla, marshmallow, and macaroon, with underlying tropical fruit, cut grass, and subtle spearmint. A feminine whisky to have with dessert -- or as dessert."
2845,"<price>69<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Arran) 19 year old, 49.7%<review>Thanks to the Gulf Stream, palm trees grow on Arran’s west coast. That prevailing sunny climate appears to have influenced this mature example from Lochranza: ripe, yellow summer fruits, lime zest, strong mixed spices, and notes of the sea, like sand brushed from seashells. Very approachable; this just oozes sunshine, bringing us the joys of sweet citrus, spices, marzipan, mango, and papaya. The finish is like slurping melted ice cream."
2846,"<price>49<rating>86<whiskey>Grand Traverse Islay Rye, 45%<review>Once you get over any initial disappointment (there is no peat smoke), this is one engaging and mouthwatering whiskey; clean with malty cereal notes, golden raisins, bread dough, and freshly-sawn oak. The real clincher, however, is the captivating wisp of saline sea breeze echoing across a warming finish of cherry hard candies, rye spice, and salt brine. Medium-bodied, fresh, and delicious. (Distillery only) 375ml"
2847,"<price>85<rating>97<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2013 Release), 51.5%<review>A marriage of 13 and 18 year old bourbons. A mature yet very elegant whiskey, with a silky texture and so easy to embrace with a splash of water. Balanced notes of honeyed vanilla, soft caramel, a basket of complex orchard fruit, blackberry, papaya, and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg; smooth finish. Sophisticated, stylish, with well-defined flavors. A classic!"
2848,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Kavalan King Car Conductor, 46%<review>King Car is the name of the Taiwanese company that owns the Kavalan brand and this lavishly packaged single malt is its standard bearer. It's not hard to see why. More subtle and complex than some earlier bottlings of Kavalan, this has an exotic fruit, cream toffee, and soft banana nose, and has bitter orange, dark chocolate, and pepper on the palate. It's rapier-sharp, clean, and drying rather than sweet. "
2849,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>High West Campfire, 46%<review>A blend of bourbon, rye, and smoky Scotch whisky. The foundation here is bourbon sweetness (caramel, toffee, vanilla) with a tug-of-war between rye spice (cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg) and peat smoke. Tobacco and honey-soaked berries round out the palate, with additional leather notes on the finish. Not something I would drink every day, but this whisky packs plenty of intrigue. (sourced whiskey)"
2850,"<price>67<rating>86<whiskey>Signatory Un-Chillfiltered Collection 11 year old (distilled at Edradour), 46%<review>Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5th, 2002 and bottled on February 26th, 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas, cloves, and sherry, plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky, with sweet sherry, digestive biscuits, soft spices, dates, and figs. The finish is medium and fruity, with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42"
2851,"<price>125<rating>72<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Cameronbridge), Cask #3583, 28 year old, 54.4%<review>Its best attributes are vanilla, toasted coconut, and tropical fruit, but the rest of this grain whisky is a bit of a disappointment. It is thin, and at times harsh. A paint thinner component is evident (especially on the nose), along with more wood on the finish than this thin body can handle. Two Carsebridge grain Scotch whiskies from Duncan Taylor which I have tasted recently were much better: richer and creamier, and with more balance."
2852,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Celebratory Blend, 51%<review>
This spicy concoction, inspired by John Walker’s original Old Highland Whisky, has a nose of marzipan, candied peel, raisin, marmalade, aromatic spices, pepper, and ginger loaf, with a trace of cool smoke and peppermint. The strength and pepperiness give this plenty of clout, with a flavor unique among Johnnie Walker whiskies: brown sugar, hazelnut, royal icing on wedding cake, nuts, pepper, clove, peat, and blackened fruitcake."
2853,"<price>300<rating>89<whiskey>Scapa 25 year old, 54%<review>A limited edition of 2000 bottles. Thick and syrupy on the palate, accentuated with vanilla and shortbread. You’ll also find pleasing peaches & cream, zingy citrus fruit, along with a hint of nuts, spice, and a pinch of salt on the palate. A nice addition to the 14 year old distillery bottling. Kudos for bottling it at cask strength.

The whisky was selected by distillery manager Ian Mackay and his team, and matured in Matusalem sherry and American white oak casks. 1,800 bottles are available. Worn leather, candied orange, malt, and cinnamon on the nose. Spicy orange, sherry, mixed nuts, and licorice on the palate. The finish is slowly drying, with dark chocolate and smoky caramel notes. £85"
2855,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Blue Hanger 4th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd, 45.6%<review>This Blue Hanger has sherry and fruit on the nose, but it's all reined in. Then the palate is big, rich, complex, and fruity, and late oakiness from some 30 year-plus malt in the mix brings the perfect finale. £61"
2856,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Oregon Spirit Single Barrel Bottled in Bond Bourbon (No. 150330 01), 50%<review>The nose starts with anise cookies and butterscotch, then reveals magnolia leaf, bergamot, sarsaparilla, and tea leaves. Barrel-driven, the palate is peppery, minty, and a little piney, with bitter chocolate and roasted nuts. More black pepper, chocolate, peppermint stick, and bitter oak into the short finish. Water recommended. (278 bottles)"
2857,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Hyde No. 6 President’s Reserve Sherry Cask Finish, 46%<review>Vanilla, dark chocolate, pepper, ground ginger, hard candy, floral blooms, Parma Violets, and dried apple sing from this oloroso sherry butt-finished blend of 18 year old triple-distilled single malt and 8 year old single grain. Syrupy fruit textures with flavors of apricot conserve, the European oak finds harmony with the orchard fruits, gingerbread, and pepper. Mouth-coating, lingering finish of oak and dried banana. (5,000 bottles)"
2858,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 1993 Vintage, 43%<review>Straw gold color. Very clean aroma and flavor-malty, with vanilla, cotton candy, honey and subtle floral notes. Light in body and somewhat creamy in texture, with a soft, slightly youthful finish. More Irish character than previous Knappogue bottlings, and quite mature for an eight year old whiskey. It is a touch youthful on the finish. While it is quite enjoyable now (and unbelievably drinkable), I would like to have seen this whiskey with another one to two years of aging to give it a little more depth and maturity on the finish."
2859,"<price>130<rating>93<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 13 year old Bottled in Bond (Spring 2019 Release), 50%<review>The first of Old Fitzgerald’s semiannual releases for 2019. The nose offers vanilla flan, banana cream pie, and powdered sugar, but is also floral, with tropical notes of peach, coconut, and melon, all draped lightly in tobacco leaf. The palate is gentle, with maple syrup, marshmallow, milk chocolate, ripe peach, coconut, orange, and oak. A rich finish offers honey, chocolate, almond, toasted oak, and a hint of cigar. A pleasurable progression of flavors. Collectible"
2860,"<price>120<rating>94<whiskey>The Macallan 17 year old Fine Oak, 43%<review>Another of the Fine Oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks), which will debut in the U.S. in March. Of the five Fine Oak expressions that will be in the U.S. (10, 15, 17, 21, and 30 year old), this is my favorite, slightly besting the 15 year old. Lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla, light toffee, marshmallow, shortbread, and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices, along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. A very refined and sophisticated whisky."
2861,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Waterford Arcadian Series Organic Gaia 1.1, 50%<review>
Satsuma peel, aromatic florals, and a low level of aromatic spices, then fruit syrups and a hint of olive oil on the nose: It’s clean and bright, with plenty of sweetness. The citrus, toffee, and salted-caramel sweetness of the palate are disrupted by a shockwave of pepper, leaving tangy peels, hints of nuts, and sour gooseberry in its wake before a finish of citrus and sweet barley."
2862,"<price>42<rating>85<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s, 40%<review>Interesting that the label says “Artfully Aged,” yet there’s no actual age statement. Lively nose, good rye snap and spice, a bit of mint and oaky edge. Not hot, well-behaved on the tongue, and happily gives back everything taken on the nose. Sweet, spicy, and easy to like, this is whiskey without flaw, well-done and tasty, if not overly ambitious or challenging."
2863,"<price>11<rating>78<whiskey>Seagram’s 7 Crown, 40%<review>“75% Grain Spirits.” Let’s get that right out there! Slight rose cast to the liquid, and a smell of caramel and brown sugar. Thin, with a hot finish, but drinkable. Honestly, while this is not something I’d even shoot with a beer chaser, it’s hardly flawed; this is clean and makes a decent mixer."
2864,"<price>294<rating>88<whiskey>Grant’s 25 year old, 40%<review>I was surprised to find that Grant’s blends were noticeable by their absence in the U.S. But with the purchase of Tuthilltown in New York and Tullamore Dew in Ireland, that is slowly changing; and here's proof. Beautiful, honeyed, rich, but the 40% ABV makes it the whisky equivalent of a radio DJ cutting off “Freebird” before the solo at the end. Still great, and indeed better than most competition, but not the classic it could be."
2865,"<price>300<rating>93<whiskey>Glen Moray 25 year old Port Cask Finish, 43%<review>Distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. Floral, perfumed, and very enticing on the nose. Vanilla fudge, cocktail cherries, polished oak, and gentle spices. Soft and sweet on the palate, with vanilla, overripe orange, cinnamon, and milky coffee. Long and slightly peppery on the finish, with persistent drying fruitiness. Complex and extremely accomplished."
2866,"<price>200<rating>87<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1967, 46%<review>Deep gold color. A very delightful aroma that defies its age, with notes of rich creamy vanilla, exotic tropical fruit, honey, and toasted oak. Rich, mouth coating texture and body. Its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla, tropical fruit, honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry, leathery, and oaky on the finish. Soothing, long dry finish."
2867,"<price>17<rating>76<whiskey>Jeremiah Weed Blended Bourbon, 45%<review>A generally sweet palate (a bit too sweet, actually), with vanilla, sweet corn, caramel, marzipan, candied fruit, and a suggestion of red and black licorice, peppered with cinnamon. Slightly harsh on the finish. I wish there was more to balance all the sweetness. (Perhaps some extra aging for some additional dry oak spiciness?)"
2868,"<price>121<rating>83<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Longmorn) 1990, 48.1%<review>Longmorn is one of Speyside’s fruit bombs, something which remains true here, even if in slightly paler guise than usual. Instead of ripe autumn fruits, here you get kiwi, William pear, green plum, even green tomato, and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of sakura (cherry blossom). I’d keep water well away, such is this light, lacy Longmorn’s fragility. £73"
2869,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Old Pulteney), 35 year old, 1969 vintage, 43%<review>Surprisingly fresh - sanguine even - for its age, and appetizingly aromatic. Fairly light and approachable in body, but always inspiring and pithy. Notes of fresh, seabreeze brine, teasing exotic spices, and tangerine are softened by gently creamy malt notes and hints of coconut and almond. Very delicious and enjoyable anytime."
2870,"<price>153<rating>84<whiskey>Caol Ila, 58.4%<review>Without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. With water, it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. The taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point. "
2871,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Clyde May’s Cask Strength 8 year old, 58.5%<review>Rich and rounded vanilla, baking spices, caramel, and cast iron-baked cornbread straight from the oven. Hints of smoke, dried apricot, fresh-cut grass, and tilled earth. Then, raw honey, marzipan, raisins, and sweet oats, followed by baking spices for a medium to long finish. It’s very nice and needs no dilution to open up. Think of this as a high-proof sipper."
2872,"<price>99<rating>91<whiskey>Method & Madness Wild Cherry Wood-Finished, 46%<review>This pale-gold whiskey has a bright and refreshing nose with lots of floral character, apricot, vanilla frosting, apple tart, and gentle background spices. Lemon meringue pie, sugary sweetness, stone fruits, vanilla, orange citrus, and an undertow of spice that mingles higher in the mix by the end: a mirror image of its fragrant aromas. The Method & Madness experimental range is delivering some wonderfully characterful whiskeys that are worth hunting down. (2,500 bottles) (€92)"
2873,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Danfield's Limited Edition, 21 year old, 40%<review>Light on the nose, with creamy vanilla, honey, soft oak, and delicate tropical fruit. Similar follow-through on the palate. I like how creamy and clean it is -- especially for 21 years old. It’s a light whisky, the kind that 21 years in the wood could have put a hurtin’ on, but it didn’t. An enjoyable Canadian whisky. (Exclusive to the Canadian market.)"
2874,"<price>95<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster Arcana, 46%<review>
Comparatively speaking, this is a little monster for peat-loving monster hunters. Lemon, attractive florals, pine forests, and gentle peat smoke. Sweet flavors cascade through honey, lemon, candied peel, and vanilla fudge, heading toward sweet cinnamon, chocolate, clove, and a dry finish of oak and straw bundles. The neat touch here was filling cask-strength Peat Monster into custom French oak casks. A very fine blend indeed. (8,328 bottles, 3,900 for U.S.)"
2875,"<price>41<rating>89<whiskey>Monkey Shoulder Smokey Monkey, 40%<review>This balances sweetness, vanilla, and smoke extremely well, and I found it preferable
to Monkey Shoulder for sipping neat. On the palate, there’s sweet smoke from
blackened oak logs, fragrant spices, a well-developed vanilla note, and a hint of
orange peel. The structure hangs lightly, and more weight behind the smoke would
have been preferable, but the sweetness and spice yield to lovely creamy vanilla
flavors, banana, and a finish of milky coffee. £32"
2876,"<price>499<rating>91<whiskey>Dewar’s 30 year old Ne Plus Ultra, 40%<review>This Pedro Ximénez-finished blend is the oldest Dewar’s expression available. It offers a deliciously deep nose of chocolate-dipped biscuits, dried fruits, and orange peel. The palate includes indulgent rewards of berry fruit, chocolate praline, raspberry, cherry, dried cranberry, and hazelnut. It remains succulent throughout, the sherry fruit keeping the upper hand over the chocolate and batting away the occasional coffee note. A dry finish with nutty chocolate and roasted spice. (Global Travel Retail only)"
2877,"<price>100<rating>76<whiskey>Navazos-Palazzi Single Palo Cortado Cask, 52.5%<review>A non-age statement Spanish malt whisky. Whereas Scotch whisky is often a showcase of the grain, this Spanish malt is all about spotlighting the unique Palo Cortado sherry cask. Monster raisin leads things off and is followed by apricot jam, honey, ginger, and grape blossom. The impact of sherry is so great, it borders on tasting like an interesting young Spanish brandy. A very spicy mid-palate, which is a little hot, drives a very dry finish. (U.S. only)"
2878,"<price>73<rating>92<whiskey>Glann ar Mor September 2012, 46%<review>Glann ar Mor is a rising star in the world of whisky, one of three very impressive distilleries in the Brittany region in Northern France, and this new single malt, fresh from the cask at the back end of September, is its finest release yet. A mixture of soft tinned fruits, especially sweet pears in syrup, sweet vanilla ice cream, and a delicate but assertive earthy underbed make this an utter delight. Magnifique. €57"
2879,"<price>145<rating>81<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Auchentoshan) 21 year old 1983 vintage, 52.4%<review>Surprisingly thick and oily in texture for a Lowlander. There’s plenty of marshmallow, vanilla cream, and ripe barley, with interspersed cut grass, lemon, and mustard seed. Drying oak spice notes on the finish. Not as polished or refined as the distillery bottling of the same age, but it still has many redeeming qualities."
2880,"<price>14<rating>77<whiskey>Clansman, 40%<review>This Highland blend has a nose of lemon peel, tangerine, and pine-scented kitchen surfaces. The whisky is young, with a sweet mandarin dressing over the grain character, barley sugars, and a gentle rumble of spice. What it lacks at this age is mouthfeel, structure, and wood influence. The finish continues the sugared orange theme, with spice and ground pepper fading to soor plooms. For what can be expected at this age, the Clansman does its job well."
2881,"<price>105<rating>89<whiskey>Hillrock Estate American Single Malt (Barrel No. OPX-30), 48.2%<review>A vibrant nose, thanks in part to Hillrock’s on-site malting floor and kiln: baby back ribs, grilled corn, tobacco leaf, pecans, nutmeg, figs, and clean mineral smoke. The dry palate is savory, smoky, and mouthwatering, with spiced nuts, grilled sausages, orange oil, grilled apples, clove, nutmeg, and hints of rubber. It finishes with coffee ice cream, smoked salt, tobacco leaf, dark chocolate, and lingering savory smoke. (60,000 bottles)"
2882,"<price>329<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1982 (Cask #4567), 56%<review>Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)"
2883,"<price>84<rating>92<whiskey>Yeun Elez Jobic Single Malt, 46%<review>Heavily peated to 50 ppm, the nose greets you with lemon sponge cake, maritime notes, smoked bacon rind, and aromatic smoke, opening up blue-gray peat-fire smoke, light toffee, fire-blackened driftwood, clove, and peppercorn. Silky soft, with lemon, vanilla, fresh apple, and honey, plus pepper ground over caramel and peach. The palate runs clean and pure: Picture a peat lover behind the wheel of an electric car."
2884,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Dailuaine), 1973 vintage, 31 year old, 50%<review>A robust Speysider — and very tactile too (clinging to the palate), but with no excessive oak. Vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating (yet ironically dry-ish) honey notes. But its biggest flavor note is citrus — particularly lemon, along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple — which helps to cut through the thickness. Good depth, with dried spice, polished oak, and a wisp of smoke on the finish. (Bottled in 2004, but only recently released to the U.S.)"
2885,"<price>180<rating>88<whiskey>Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Glenlivet) 1977 vintage 30 year old (Cask #19786), 43% <review>Once again Lorne Mackillop demonstrates his talent for selecting whiskies with beautiful balance. This time it’s with a well-aged Glenlivet. Sure, it shows many of the notes that I often find in Glenlivet (Speyside elegance, peachy vanilla, tropical fruit, floral and honeyed-malt notes), but I’m also picking up more subtle notes: dark chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit, perhaps even charcoal (especially on the finish), making the whisky a bit more complex and curiously attractive."
2886,"<price>188<rating>89<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster Cask Strength Magnum, 57.3%<review>Dry peats tossed on a driftwood fire with coastal aromas of sun-scorched seaweed beside high tide rock pools comprise this refined dram. A momentary glimpse of lighter lemon, lime, and pineapple is quickly snuffed out by the full strength assault. It’s like pulling the pin on a grenade. There’s a dense barrage of peat moss, worn leather, and cocoa at the death. Ride through it to glory. Possibly the highest ABV that Compass Box has ever given us. £120"
2887,"<price>160<rating>93<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Straight Rye (Barrel No. 19F965), 46.4%<review>Concord grape juice, leather armchair, cola syrup, iced tea, roasted pecans, and furniture polish on the nose. The palate is deeply fruity, with cooked cherries, blackberries, Concord grape jelly, Coca-Cola, dark chocolate, silky baking spice, and white pepper, with a lush and velvety texture. A complex finish of bitter chocolate, peanut shell, Dr. Pepper, and leathery oak rounds things out."
2888,"<price>181<rating>94<whiskey>Aberfeldy 14 year old Single Cask, 58.1%<review>Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between, and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas, raisins, and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally, burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate, with apricots, dried fruits, honey, and sherry. Gently spicy and warming, with licorice in the notably long finish. £115"
2889,"<price>59<rating>86<whiskey>GlenDronach 12 year old, 46%<review>Nicely sherried. Rich, with maple syrup, honey-drenched citrus, sultana, and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. Well done for a 12 year old, and definite competition for Macallan of the same age. "
2890,"<price>105<rating>88<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Macduff) 2006 11 year old, 53.4%<review>Distilled in 2006 and aged 11 years in an oloroso hogshead (#101751). The nose offers butterscotch, sultanas, and developing caramel notes. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with banana, figs, malt, and a hint of sherry in the background. Medium to long in the finish, with a suggestion of lemon and insistent fruity spices. (224 bottles)"
2891,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Tomatin Cask Strength Edition, 57.5%<review>This is Tomatin’s first cask strength offering, and is also non-chill filtered. The initial batch of 15,000 bottles was released in February, and was matured in a mix of oloroso and bourbon casks. The nose showcases ginger, malt, Jaffa oranges, almonds, and melon, while the pleasingly viscous palate offers caramel, vanilla, warm leather, and chocolate-coated lime creams. Long and gently spicy in the drying finish. (Worldwide except U.S.) £50"
2892,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2014 Release), 55.9%<review>Crisp clove, cool mint, cinnamon, and cocoa mingle with glazed orange, honeyed vanilla, caramel, and maple syrup. Polished oak and leather on the finish balance the sweet, fruity notes. More oak and dried spice when compared to the 2013 release (our American Whiskey of the Year) and, while not quite reaching that caliber (it’s not quite as seamless, drinkable, or complex), it gets close. Very impressive."
2893,"<price>190<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut Rye Single Malt, 50%<review>What’s a rye single malt, you ask? It’s 100% malted rye distilled in pot stills, bursting with rye spices, thick toffee, malt loaf, chocolate, licorice, burnt sugar, and tropical fruits. Praline, cinnamon, and burnt orange flavors succumb to an assault of spice, tropical fruits, and licorice, ending with virgin American oak char before a gum-numbing aniseed finish of Fisherman’s Friends. Water just mutes the enjoyment, so leave it."
2894,"<price>40<rating>89<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd Classic Range Peated Cask Matured, 44.2%<review>A pale blend with hidden depths of flavor and a sweet nose of honeyed pear, vanilla, Golden Delicious apples, taffy, and custard tarts, all overlaid with ashy smoke and drifting smoke trails from snuffed-out candles. Pear, apple, clove, and cracked black pepper meet butter toffee, vanilla, and nippy spices. It’s imbued with a pretty smoky flavor for a peated cask, and leaves a creamy aftertaste to savor. £32"
2895,"<price>12000<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glen Grant) 60 year old, 42.3%<review>Rich gold. Superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio, mixing fragrant mango with a little mint, rosewater, and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. The palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon). It’s late summer, when there’s a sense of the year turning, and you allow fond memories to gently wash over you. £7,800"
2896,"<price>120<rating>82<whiskey>The Classic Cask Kentucky Straight Rye Whiskey, 21 year old, 45%<review>Chewy toffee and nougat, with some dusty corn notes along with minty rye and cinnamon. The whiskey’s fruit is subtle and subdued, finishing boldly dry with oaky vanilla and leather. Not as bright and intensely spicy as the Sazerac Rye 18 year old on the market, and it’s the antithesis of the younger Sazerac Rye 6 year old also reviewed in this Buyer’s Guide. An enjoyable, mature rye whiskey. 
"
2897,"<price>99<rating>87<whiskey>Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2003 Vintage), 48.3%<review>This follows the first limited release of the 2002 vintage Peat Week. Like its predecessor, this was distilled during the distillery’s annual week of peated production. Significantly peatier on the nose than the 2002, with Islay-like phenols backed by sweet floral notes. Sweet smoke, vanilla, citrus fruits, and honey on the bold palate, while the finish features more vanilla and honey, plus spicy bonfire smoke."
2898,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Seasoned Wood, 50%<review>A wheated recipe bourbon that was aged in experimental barrels with staves utilizing various methods of seasoning. Oak spice is important with a wheated bourbon, as there is no rye to balance the sweet notes, and this whiskey does a great job here. Delicate in personality, with nutty caramel, dried citrus, and golden raisin segueing to polished leather, warming cinnamon, clove, and hints of a cigar humidor."
2899,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>King of Kentucky 15 year old Straight Bourbon (2019 Release, Barrel 8), 65.5%<review>Walnuts in maple syrup, grape jelly, cooked cherries, peanuts in Coke, ginger syrup, iced tea, and varnish on the nose. Adding water first reveals sweeter notes, then fully opens up the tightly wound palate, unfurling bittersweet chocolate, pipe tobacco, cherry pie, blackberry preserves, roasted spices, and sweet nuttiness. The lengthy finish is nutty and rich, with generous spice, chocolate, oak, and cola. Collectibles"
2900,"<price>48<rating>91<whiskey>Hyde No. 5 The Áras Cask Burgundy Cask Finish, 46%<review>Triple distilled in Coffey stills and aged for over 6 years, the black grape, blackberry, dry-roasted spices, and cocoa demonstrate how the 6-month finish was well-judged. A wonderful mouthfeel, the wine notes chasing the vanilla sweetness, fudge, gentle spices, and creamy custard tarts before a finish of chocolate and spiced dark fruit. This is so good, I had to check the bottle to confirm this was grain whiskey. (5,000 bottles)"
2901,"<price>98<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Garioch Vintage 1999, 56.3%<review>This limited edition release of Glen Garioch is the first from the Aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in oloroso sherry casks. Just 1,000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. Old leather, slightly earthy, sultanas, white pepper, and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. The palate is big and bold, with more pepper, plus cinnamon caramel, orange, and abundant sherry. Enduring spice, licorice, and slightly smoky raisins in the finish."
2902,"<price>75<rating>85<whiskey>Tullibardine The Murray (2004 Vintage), 56.1%<review>Distilled in 2004, The Murray was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is offered at cask strength, non-chill filtered. The nose opens with confident, sweet fruit notes—overripe bananas and peach slices—with background milky coffee. Rich and sweet on the palate, developing vanilla spices, chewy tropical fruits. The finish is long, with cinnamon, licorice, and oak tannins."
2903,"<price>18<rating>72<whiskey>Jeremiah Weed Cherry Mash Flavored, 45%<review>Artificial cherry aroma, like cherry PEZ, and barely a hint of bourbon. The taste is not overpoweringly sweet at all, a surprise, and there's a nutty, almost Luxardo-like character in the cherry that would be more interesting if it weren't for the soapy notes and bitter medicinal flavor of the whiskey. A more natural cherry character would net a higher rating.  "
2904,"<price>165<rating>89<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 08.1, 59.3%<review>Distilled in 2008 from 100 percent Scottish barley peated to 167 ppm. It spent 8 years in first-fill American oak casks. Peaches dipped in hot plain chocolate and tarry peat on the fragrant nose. The palate offers sweet, creamy orchard fruits and honey, backed by citrus-laden peat. Drying in the finish to quite a bitter, tannic smokiness. (42,000 bottles)"
2905,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Armorik Double Maturation, 46%<review>This is one of those whiskies where one sip will convert you to its delights. Fruit salad with fresh apple and lime, fruit-flavored hard candy, roasted aromatic spices, salted potato skins, and digestive biscuits. A moreish palate of salted caramel, musty chocolate, sweet fruits, viennoiseries, creamy caramels, malt, and gentle spices, which peaks during the finish leaving baked apple flavors and late sherry notes. Don’t pass this up."
2906,"<price>90<rating>87<whiskey>Barrell Bourbon (Batch 006), 61.45%<review>Less driving aroma than Batch 005; lower floor? Both are a mashbill of 70/26/4% corn/rye/malt. More corn and cinnamon and bread dough in the nose here. A lot like 005, but more sweet cornmeal, less spice, less height in the mouth, and the finish is sweeter and longer. Might be that farmer’s younger brother; this one’s only 8 years old. Still good, a bit less complex. Sourced whiskey."
2907,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Black Bull 12 year old, 50%<review>A solid presence in the range, the strength and malt content continue to mark these out over their contemporaries. Grapefruit peels, sliced juicy orange, and lemon butter icing on the nose. The palate is thinner than others in the range, with crystallized orange, fudge, plus cardamom and mild pepper. The finish of sugared satsumas is boosted by a long lasting trail of spices."
2908,"<price>94<rating>81<whiskey>Hanyu Ace of Clubs 2000, 59.4%<review>Ichiro loves Japanese oak (mizunara) and here’s a finished example. You need water, however, to be able to discern those characteristic incense notes. Without it, you’re in a world of vanilla and resin. The neat palate is hot but firm, with some red fruits and an allspice note. Water is needed, and does allow a fresh acidity to come through on the finish; sadly it also adds tannic bitterness. A tricky balancing act. ¥9,000"
2909,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Balcones Baby Blue American Corn Whiskey (Batch 19-1), 46%<review>A polarizing nose of tropical fruit (papaya, mango, melon) drenched in butterscotch vies with the distinct aroma of tennis shoes on asphalt. The palate is hot, dry, and somewhat ashy, with billowing smoke, tobacco leaf, and nuttiness, undercut by lime and orange oil. Drying and oak-driven on the finish, it’s sweetened by the addition of water."
2910,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old wheated bourbon from floor #9, 45%<review>Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Darker, more intense and mysterious in personality when compared to its two siblings. Notes of barrel char, roasted nuts, polished oak, and tobacco, peppered with dried spice. Fortunately, sweet notes of toffee, maple syrup, and caramel stand up to the dry notes and provide balance. Price is per 375 ml."
2911,"<price>55<rating>81<whiskey>The MacPhail's Collection (distilled at Glenturret), 15 year old, 46%<review>Gently sweet, with toffee, nougat, and honey-glazed nuts, balanced by bright citrus and sultana. A soothing, unpretentious, malt I would save for after dinner. 
"
2912,"<price>224<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing 21 year old (distilled at Highland Park), 52.6%<review>This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range, and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015. The outturn is just 228 bottles. Boiled fruit sweets and malt on the nose, with underlying sea salt and gentle, leathery smoke. Confident in the mouth, with allspice, honey, barley, and wood smoke. The finish is lengthy, with drying oak and peat. £155"
2913,"<price>3300<rating>93<whiskey>Port Ellen 1978 35 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 56.5%<review>Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up, so either buddy-up to a rich guy, or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke’s in the background, as salted cashew, peppermint, tansy, furniture polish, and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked, with some chocolate and wax. Finally, a Port Ellen that is truly, classically mature. A killer. (2,964 bottles)"
2914,"<price>406<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Elgin, 1998 vintage, 61.1%<review>Matured in a “rejuvenated European oak” cask. Balance: that’s what I like best about this whisky. It’s not as individualistic or distinctive as the others, but that’s how I always think of Glen Elgin, so no surprise here. This is a solid effort: fruity and flowery, with notes of tangerine, marmalade, caramel apple, ginger, cut grass, cinnamon, almond paste, and underlying vanilla, lingering in a satisfying finish. (534 bottles) £250"
2915,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Single Barrel, 61%<review>Wonderful opening of cigar humidor and tack room, it presents vibrant caramel and vanilla, but really shines with complex fruit, spice, and nuts. Baked apples, canned pears, blackberries, and strawberry jam meet white pepper, followed by roasted walnuts and honey. Then resounding nutmeg appears, with slight hints of smoke, chipotle, and earth. The long finish rekindles the caramel note from the beginning. Must-have sipper."
2916,"<price>70<rating>78<whiskey>Kaiapoi 13 year old, 40%<review>Kaiapoi is a small town in North Canterbury, New Zealand, and was in the frontline of the recent horrific earthquake that wrecked this pretty part of the south island. Made by distiller John Fitzgerald and matured for 13 years, this whisky has been something of a secret. It tastes like nothing else on earth. It’s like Germany’s Blaue Maus — working off a different template than scotch. Imagine sweet alcoholic hazelnuts giving way to spice. Lacks depth, though. "
2917,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Cody Road Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel 120,184), 52.5%<review>A 70/20/10% mashbill (corn/wheat/malt), aged 32 months. A sweet corn, citrus-tipped nose, not as hot as expected. Hot on the tongue, though, and spreads like fire. Dynamic balance of sweet corn and spicy candy with crimping oak spice and alcohol heat. Finish is like fireworks: a rush to an explosion of sweet, oaky heat in the back of the mouth, with a slow spark rain that sparkles on the tongue. Exciting."
2918,"<price>29<rating>84<whiskey>Wild Turkey Russell's Reserve 10 year old, 45%<review>New packaging, new formulation, and even a new strength. The new packaging is more stylish, the new formulation is more approachable, as is the new strength (45% rather than 50.5%). The previous Russell’s Reserve was big and brooding, with huge flavors of chewy toffee, oak, leather, and tobacco. This new expression is more elegant, with lighter sugars (honey, cotton candy, caramel, maple syrup), more fruit (candied orange, pineapple, coconut), and creamy vanilla. A tame expression of Wild Turkey (although the flavors are nicely balanced and seamlessly tied together). Ideally, I would like to see the bourbon with the new formula but bottled at the old strength of 101 proof."
2919,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Sheep Dip 'Old Hebridean,' 1990 vintage, 40%<review>A marriage of Dalmore, Fettercairn, and Ardbeg, and their personalities certainly show. The whisky was blended and then aged for an additional 15 years -- very atypical. The marriage of the three really works very well, combining a rich sweetness (honeyed malt, toffee) with spice, brine, vanilla, bitter chocolate, charcoal, espresso, tobacco, cigar ash, subtle marmalade, and firm -- but not dominating -- leafy peat smoke. Thick, nicely-textured body, too. Lingering brine and smoke on the finish. Delicious as it is, I can only imagine what it would be like bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. (I probably would be bumping it up a few points.)"
2920,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Coppersea Bottled in Bond Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye, 50%<review>A bottled in bond sequel to the 48% ABV Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye whiskey, this second Empire rye from Coppersea Distilling is made from 100% Hudson Valley rye. A whiff of new wood yields to complex notes of blood orange, iced tea, cinnamon, cloves, and red candy. A palate of allspice, mint, white pepper, and orange peel is followed by a spicy, herbaceous finish that also offers citrus, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco."
2921,"<price>33<rating>86<whiskey>Leopold Bros. Small Batch American Whiskey (Barrel #1206), 43%<review>The nose is plucky and herbaceous, with tarragon, dill, licorice, and heaps of chili powder and cornmeal—a bit like elote from a street vendor. Savory flavors dominate the palate, which is dry and nutty; water brings out meaty chili, unsweetened chocolate, and coffee bean. The finish has grilled corn, more chili spices, and roasted pecans. Water softens the edges, but use a light touch so as not to over dilute."
2922,"<price>95<rating>90<whiskey>Puni Vina, 43%<review>A moreish nose, rich and sophisticated, this was matured for 5 years in marsala vergine casks. A malty nose with cinnamon, dark rye bread, plain chocolate, toasted cereals, worn leather, plum sauce, dry spice, and dark red fruits is testament to the cask influence. Mouth-drawing on the palate, there’s raspberry, black grape, brown sugar, cherry syrup, blueberry, and bramble, with a finish of fruit skins and spice."
2923,"<price>90<rating>96<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2012 Release), 55.7%<review>A marriage of four different bourbons, ranging from 11 to 17 years old. This, to me, is benchmark Four Roses: subtly complex, vibrant, yet fully matured, with well-defined flavors of bramble, dry citrus, soft creamy vanilla, caramel, marzipan, allspice, a hint of cinnamon, and subtle cedar-aged cigar tobacco.  Soft, clean, polished oak finish. A very versatile bourbon! Your decision shouldn’t be whether to buy it, but rather how much water to add."
2924,"<price>2050<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1954, 50.6%<review>A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. As it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1,250"
2925,"<price>230<rating>89<whiskey>Dalmore 18 year old, 43%<review>Matured in American oak and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is fragrant with honey, vanilla, ginger, orange marmalade, and a hint of smoke. Relatively full-bodied, with flavors of tangy orange, marzipan, sherry, bitter chocolate, then oak. The finish is long, with licorice and citrus fruit."
2926,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Detroit City Homegrown Rye, 47%<review>Spicy, buttery nose (“aged six months with oak staves”) with some oak plank notes. Hey, that's pretty tasty! Rye character is spicy, forward, and flows surely right into the nicely warm finish. Michigan-grown rye done in a pot still in downtown Detroit, about a mile and a half from the Hiram Walker plant. Good young rye; one to watch."
2927,"<price>325<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 34 year old 1971 vintage (Cask #8363), 53%<review>Rummy molasses and toffee sweetness intertwine with roasted nuts and bright, juicy fruit. Suggestions of fig, lavender, leather, and tobacco throughout, with a hint of peat and polished oak on the finish. Not quite as refined as the Highland Park 18 year old, but it makes up for this with its dynamic personality. A delicious ultra-mature, sherry cask-aged whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)"
2928,"<price>23<rating>86<whiskey>Canadian Club Classic 12 (batch C12-014), 40%<review>Since Canadian Club refined its batching process, this 12 year old whisky has begun to show pleasing differences among batches. And though a batch is exactly that, a batch, bottling codes reveal that different bottle sizes of a single batch can be filled weeks apart. Caramel, dark fruits, and luscious sweetness jump out of the glass to fill the room. Behind that, the classic Canadian Club pruniness, butterscotch, and hot pepper ride on a wagonload of dried oak timber."
2929,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>SIA, 43%<review>This Kickstarter-funded blend is a very savvy and seamless mix of 40% malt and 60% grain whiskies. Pale gold in color, the nose is inviting, with dried apricot, honey, tangerine, and salt. Everything from the nose comes together on the palate, which is soft and sweet with the right amount of oak and smoke to balance everything out. There's a dash of heat and a solid finish. Who'd ever expect such a smart and affable whisky to come from Kickstarter? (U.S. only)"
2930,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Penderyn Celt, 43%<review>Blender Aista Jukneviciute finishes Celt in peated Islay quarter casks that enable the sooty charcoal smoke and maritime notes to sink their claws into the fresh lemon, mandarin, and buttery, toasty aromas. Penderyn, the best known of the small but growing number of Welsh distilleries, is in the process of constructing a second distillery with a visitor center in Swansea anticipated to open in 2021 and has proposed a third facility for Llandudno. Sweet citrus, dark fruits, chocolate, and spicy smoke linger on the finish. Forget Daenerys, this is the whisky of dragons. Number 17 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
2931,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Milford, Batch 1M32, 1991 Vintage, 10 year old, 43%<review>A cask from some of the last remaining stocks of whisky from New Zealand’s Wilson distillery. A very unpretentious creamy-sweet malt (fresh vanilla, honey), with subtle floral notes, mint and hints of smoke. A bit youthful in character-especially on the finish. I think two to five more years on oak would enhance this whisky and provide additional depth and smoothness, but it is quite enjoyable right now, at ten years old. 
"
2932,"<price>50<rating>77<whiskey>Benromach Tokaji Finish, 45%<review>A very peculiar whisky. It’s interesting in some respects, with the thick, sweet Hungarian dessert wine fighting with damp peat smoke for attention. But it tastes a little disjointed, and a bit too youthful. With a few more years aging (before finishing in the Tokaji wine), the flavors should integrate and mature better. But as it is, this whisky is still “work in progress.”"
2933,"<price>84<rating>81<whiskey>Caol Ila Unpeated 12 year old Special Release 2011, 64%<review>An established regular member of Diageo’s annual set of Special Releases, this expression celebrates the lesser-known side of Islay’s largest distillery; its production of a non-smoked expression. It was this unpeated style that saved Caol Ila during the great decimation of distilleries in the early 1980s. This example is intense and needs LOTS of water for its fragrance of cut grass, sherbet, and coconut water to emerge. The palate shows boiled sweets and has a pleasingly clinging quality. £53 "
2934,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Glenlivet Archive 21 year old, 43%<review>Amber chestnut color. Aromas of mature oak, leather, ripe fruit, and toffee, are very deep and well balanced. Its flavors are rich and enveloping, with notes of treacle, toffee, roasted nuts, and a long, spicy, woody finish that lingers."
2935,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Wiser’s Last Barrels, 45%<review>Distilled in May 2001 from a bourbon-style sour mash, this whisky was intended for blending. However, times change and Wiser’s recently vatted all 132 barrels as an Ontario exclusive. High esters, sweet pitchy resins, clean wood, caramel, barley sugar, floral notes, burley tobacco, green grapes, and Granny Smith apples. And that’s just the nose. Rich toffee, vanilla, brisk white pepper, ripe black fruits. Lingering, peppery, caramel corn finish. (Canada only) C$65"
2936,"<price>27<rating>85<whiskey>James E. Pepper 1776 Rye, 50%<review>Big mint/grass nose with sweet grain and a touch of vanilla behind it. Fiery, slippery with rye oiliness, popping with that mint, and rye-bitter on the finish; a bit of a bully. That's not all bad, though; too many ryes strive to be smooth these days, but this lets it rock, and does it well. A chunk of ice doesn't hurt this at all. Potent, bold. Sourced whiskey."
2937,"<price>99<rating>92<whiskey>Sazerac 18 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 45%<review>This elder rye shows fine craftsmanship, balancing touches of toasted-spice and floral aromas, with dried herbs, candied orange peel, and mature varnish notes. It’s big on the palate, with heaps of molasses, creamy vanilla sweetness, and orange Creamsicle that lead to pleasing cedar and sandalwood oak, with zesty grapefruit notes. The medium finish is satisfying and well balanced."
2938,"<price>78<rating>88<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Tormore) 2005, 52.1%<review>Is this bottled by Duncan Taylor or Ben & Jerry’s? Ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut, with green fennel underneath. With water, it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what I mean?) and cappuccino. One sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight, such is the thickness of its impact. Okay, it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery, but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. Completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49"
2939,"<price>72<rating>82<whiskey>The Dalmore Valour, 40%<review>Initial maturation of Valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks, before a period in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzales Byass. Finally it is transferred to port pipes from the Duoro region of Portugal. The nose is floral, with sherry notes, ripe oranges, and marzipan, while the palate offers dark sherry, with bitter orange, contrasting chocolate-coated fudge, and gingersnaps. The finish is medium to long, with lively spices and berry bitterness. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
2940,"<price>180<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Moray 21 year old Portwood Finish, 46.3%<review>New to Glen Moray’s core range, this was initially matured in bourbon barrels before finishing in port pipes. The nose is fragrant and inviting, with raspberries, ginger, vanilla custard, and sultanas. Voluptuous in the mouth, with honey, cherry liqueur, coconut, marzipan, and milk chocolate vying with contrasting dried fruit and wood notes. The chocolate darkens in the finish, with raisins, licorice, and slightly tannic oak. (4,000 bottles; 1,200 for U.S.)"
2941,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>Loch Lomond 2002 Kerr Cellars Red Wine Cask-Finished, 48.1%<review>Delicately aromatic and tropical on the nose, with piña colada, pistachio pudding, almond halva, coconut, and apple blossom. The palate is elegant and pretty, nuanced with pistachio, almond, vanilla malted milkshake, coconut, and pineapple, before sweeping oak and tobacco roll into a gorgeous tropical fruit and toasted coconut finish. A masterwork in balancing spirit character with finishing cask."
2942,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Reservoir Rye Whiskey, 50%<review>There is a rich and robust distillate lurking under all that oak, with chewy maple candies, chocolate-covered cherries, and rhum agricole intensity. The astringent oak does no favors for the heat of this 100-proof whiskey, but with its lingering dark chocolate and char it’s still a bold and tasty rye."
2943,"<price>135<rating>92<whiskey>Glen Garioch The Renaissance 3rd Chapter 17 year old, 50.8%<review>The Renaissance began with a 15 year old expression and charts the same spirit as it continues to mature. Aged in bourbon and sherry casks, the 3rd Chapter exhibits a sweet and sophisticated nose of honey, milk chocolate, Brazil nuts, toffee, and ripe peaches. Supple on the palate, with luscious orange and peach notes, vanilla, oak, and subtle spice. Plain chocolate-coated orange confectionery in the finish, with caramel and ginger. Balanced and delicious! £100"
2944,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>The Irishman Single Malt Small Batch 2018, 40%<review>This noses of crumbly shortbread, vanilla, caramel, orange peels, summer blooms, walnut, and earthy whole spices, but it’s more reserved than their 12 year old. It glides through orange, spun sugar, almond paste, a slow burn of spices, butterscotch, and vanilla, before more sherry fruit comes through. Peppercorn and dark berry mark the finish of this graceful, mellow, and subdued limited-release, triple-distilled whiskey."
2945,"<price>330<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Peerless (distilled at Glenrothes) 1969 41 year old, 44.2%<review>Immediately you can tell this is a complex, old, mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there, but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the Adelphi bottling (below), along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. This is balanced by light coconut, even a hint of grist. The waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue, while the fruits become jellied. Benefits from a drop of water, allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210"
2946,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Highland Park 12 Year Old, 40%<review>Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish."
2947,"<price>95<rating>90<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt & Grain (Batch 17), 46.5%<review>A unifying blend of 10 year old Chichibu, with select stocks of American, Canadian, Irish, and scotch whiskies matured in Japan, produces a nose of toffee apple, firm caramel, milk chocolate, ground hazelnut, roasted fennel seed, chopped cilantro stalks, green banana, and struck match. Cereal-led palate with Golden Grahams, light fruits of apricot, peach, and melon, base notes of pepper, moving through butterscotch, toffee, maple syrup, and crème caramel. (U.S. Exclusive)"
2948,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>George Dickel Barrel Select, 43%<review>The newest member of the portfolio and worth every penny. It’s the distillery’s ""super-premium"" offering, produced in small batches and (for now anyway) small quantities. It is my favorite of the three Dickels from a pure taste perspective, with a lushness, roundness, sophistication and grace not often seen in a bourbon or Tennessee whiskey. All of the flavors of the other two Dickels are in here, and they’re in perfect balance and very tight. (Note: my review was from the first bottling, which was a rectangular-shaped bottle with white lettering. There has since been a second bottling, which I have not yet tasted.) 
"
2949,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Barrell 11 year old American Whiskey (Batch 004), 60.3%<review>A blend of whiskeys finished in rum and rye barrels, it’s molasses-forward with quick introductions of clove, vanilla, flowers, and strawberry. Green apple and ginger cookies appear before a burst of caramel chew, herbs, and chewing tobacco. At times fascinating for its rye, bourbon, and rum qualities, albeit a little hot, it’s a must-pour for a spirits lover."
2950,"<price>185<rating>89<whiskey>Wolves Winter Run American Whiskey, 52%<review>An eclectic blend of whiskey distilled from beer, as well as rye and malt whiskeys; it proved divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasters. The nose is resinous, with pine needles, biscuity malt, macadamia nuts, grapefruit oil, and tropical fruit. Oily on the palate, with assertive hops, pineapple, brown sugar, nuts, bread dough, and reticent spice. The finish is floral, hoppy, and pleasantly savory, with nuts, grapefruit, and lemon. This whiskey knows exactly what it is—unconventional—and it’s not afraid to show it. (1,338 bottles)"
2951,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Sierra Norte Single Barrel Yellow, 45%<review>Blue iris, dried chilies, and fresh linen; the corn is sweet and fat, and the aromas integrate more harmoniously than the White and Black expressions. Fresh and fruity, orange marmalade, honey oozing into maple syrup, developing more complexity as the smooth layers shift to accommodate the growing pepper and chili heat ahead of a spicy honey finish. For a 10 month old single cask whiskey, this is remarkably impressive."
2952,"<price>690<rating>83<whiskey>BenRiach 35 year old, 42.5%<review>A venerable bottling from its proprietor, and there’s no doubt from the nose that you’re dealing with an ultra-mature whisky. Like going in to meet your aged grandfather who is sitting in his library surrounded by old books, with a little sunlight filtering through the drapes. In time, there’s dried peach and envelope gum. The palate is wooded and concentrated, but it is dry and lacking in the required energy. Water stirs it into life, but kills the flavor. £450"
2953,"<price>179<rating>82<whiskey>Spirit of Hven Rackafallsbyn Single Malt, 45%<review>There are now fourteen distilleries in Sweden. This is the second one after Mackmyra to start bottling whisky, and it's rather good. It's clearly young, but there are big flavors here, including blackcurrant and rich citrus fruits early on, then a Highland-style earthiness toward the end, with distinctive peat lasting longest into the finish. There is a lot to like here, and with age the line between fruit and peat will become more blurred. 1295 SEK"
2954,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Still Austin Bourbon, 50%<review>Citrus oil, freshly cut wood, tea leaves, baking spice, and maple candy on the nose; with water added, more herbal and floral notes emerge, including mint, star anise, and fresh chamomile. Medium-bodied, the palate has orange peel, licorice, star anise, brown sugar, and plenty of fresh oak; here, adding water doesn't benefit the balance. It finishes quickly, with black pepper, oak, and more star anise."
2955,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2011, 50%<review>Distilled from Oxbridge and Publican barley varieties grown on six Islay farms. Lime, brine, oatmeal cookies, and custard on the nose. Sweet barley, apricots, sultanas, cloves, and quite tannic oak on the palate. Malt and sea salt in the medium-length finish."
2956,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Barr an Uisce Wicklow Rare, 43%<review>Care for a small batch, bourbon-matured blend with a 20% malt content finished for 6 months in oloroso sherry casks? Thought so. Clementine, ripe plum, and a firm, peeled-banana nose with vanilla, warm citrus, banana, raisins, and base notes of peppery spice. There’s plenty of structure and complexity on this well-balanced blend, which ebbs away with red fruits and strawberry bubblegum. Continuously juicy, with a butter toffee and white pepper finish."
2957,"<price>25<rating>91<whiskey>Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel, 45%<review>Amber gold. Delicately complex teasing aromas, with a potpourri of spices, floral notes, and complex fruit (oranges, plum, pineapple, coconut). Soft and smooth in texture. Impeccably balanced flavors and subtly complex, with notes of exotic fruit, subtle spices, almonds and soft honey tones."
2958,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>Cardhu 14 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 55%<review>Distilled in 2004, this expression was finished for 2 years in amontillado sherry-seasoned hogsheads. Soft and floral on the delicate nose, with vanilla ice cream and ripe pears. Smooth on the palate, with malt, milk chocolate, honey, nuts, and red apples. Drying in the spicy finish, with black coffee and light wood tannins. £120"
2959,"<price>26<rating>91<whiskey>Crown Royal Northern Harvest Rye, 45%<review>A blend of 95% rye-grain flavoring whisky with a variety of base whiskies. Its big whisky cocktails will tempt mixers into sipping. Very fruity and floral, with prunes, peaches, red apple skins, and bouquets of spring flowers all boosted by vibrant peppery spices on a slightly oaky base. Crown Royal’s signature balsam resin note and hints of vanilla round it out. The long, spicy finish ends with hints of citrus pith. A complex, tightly woven blend. (U.S. only) "
2960,"<price>42<rating>89<whiskey>Finger Lakes Distilling McKenzie Rye, 45.5%<review>A beguiling nose, replete with cinnamon crumble, blueberry bubble gum, and cardamom. This whiskey bakes you a blackberry pie with a flaky crust and vanilla whipped cream, rounded out with cinnamon, dill, and oregano. The finish has clove-spiced orange peel, lingering sweet marshmallow, and a surprising minerality. This is at least a year older than some of the other Empire ryes, and it shows. Craft skeptics, seek this out. Empire rye"
2961,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney 1990 Vintage, 46%<review>An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish."
2962,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Berkshire Bourbon Smoke and Peat, 43%<review>It would be easy to hate on this as bourbon, but taken merely as a whiskey, it’s compelling, original, and surprisingly well-knit. The nose betrays the smoke and sea of its Islay cask finish, while the palate offers more sweet vanilla, candied nuts, and citrus before circling back with distinct vegetal notes of seaweed and jalapeño. Perhaps bourbon is in the eye of the beholder."
2963,"<price>44<rating>85<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Cameronbridge) 1995, 43%<review>A pale grain from the colossal Fife distillery, released at 18 years old as part of Signatory’s Vintage Single Grain Collection. Vanilla icing, digestive biscuits, pumpernickel, toasted coconut flakes, crushed cumin seed, and a background note of fresh mint are apparent. The vanilla and blossom honey flavors are in union with the buttery, lightweight texture, and there’s a pulsating spiciness that lives on in the finish. A refreshing alternative. £26"
2964,"<price>277<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Garnheath) 41 year old 1974, 48.9%<review>Mid-period Garnheath here, the distillery existing for barely 20 years. This brings aromas of freshly ground pepper, oils, soft fudge, and dry monkey nut shells. The fudge is smothered by spices exploding in the mouth: ginger, nutmeg, pepper, and cinnamon. Warm toffees, oak, and citrus emerge late, but boy, this dram has great stamina and length. Sure, the finish has an oakiness, slight sourness, and a gentle, spicy pepperiness, but water subtracts more than it gains. A genuine rarity. (141 bottles) £222"
2965,"<price>145<rating>84<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Glen Grant), 26 year old, 1977 Vintage, 53.5%<review>What is it with all these older, sherried bottles of Glen Grant from the independent bottlers, anyway? Fortunately, this is one of the nicer ones. The balance of sherry and oak is commendable, and the flavor is clean with that Glen Grant “dried herb” character still evident. Sweet fruit notes (berries in honey, peach pits, sultana, ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. Clean, warming finish.

2966,"<price>215<rating>80<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Caol Ila) 1982 Smoke on the Water, 46%<review>Quite a solid start for a Caol Ila which, like the 30 year old (see above), pitches you into the farmyard, though this time it’s a sheep-shearing shed. There’s also some bacon and spent barbecue. The initial impression is of a pretty dry example, but some oil begins to seep through. The palate is explosive with some engine oil, becoming pretty flinty with violet notes, and the distillery sweetness is hidden. A little disjointed. £135"
2967,"<price>88<rating>90<whiskey>Tamdhu Batch Strength, 58.8%<review>Ian MacLeod’s first release of Tamdhu was a belter. Now, finally, it’s been joined by this high-strength NAS. There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. Hugely approachable. With water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60"
2968,"<price>400<rating>93<whiskey>Redemption 18 year old Barrel Proof Rye, 54.95%<review>Big vanilla and toasty oak meet the generous sweetness of overripe plums and cooked fruits, like canned peaches and marmalade. The deep char aromas suggest toasted marshmallows and bananas Foster, with glints of rose petal. The flavors pour forth like dense fruit preserves, coupled with sweet dried corn, whole-grain toast, and waxy notes of paraffin and honeycomb. A richly layered, complex rye with dried herbs and strawflower on the finish."
2969,"<price>56<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan Gold, 40%<review>Clean with the warming, sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. Stir in some almond butter, a little hay. The palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. Here is thickness, tongue-clinging oils, and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets, before the dry maltiness comes through. With water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36"
2970,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>Cleveland Black Reserve Bourbon, 50%<review>The nose is grainy with strong wood notes and hints of vanilla, lilac, and cinnamon candies. Flavors of caramel, vanilla, spice, and citrus tussle with cedar, tea leaves, and oak tannins before a lengthy, assertive finish of tobacco, caramel, cinnamon, clove, and orange peel.

This or whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: varies, usually 3 to 6 months;
Processing: Distillate from Indiana and Ohio is aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing Cleveland’s proprietary process using new charred oak pieces."
2971,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Whiskey Acres Bottled in Bond Bourbon (Batch 1), 50%<review>Cinnamon Red Hots, peanut shells, almonds, burnt sugar, pencil shavings, and fresh ears of corn on the nose. There’s more cinnamon on the palate, as well as milk chocolate, Goobers, orange oil, a pretty floral character, and plenty of chewy oak; a few drops of water straighten up the balance. The finish is all about the oak and cinnamon, warming and sweet. (2,100 bottles)"
2972,"<price>46<rating>84<whiskey>Stone Breaker Blended Whiskey, 46%<review>From Restless Spirits of Kansas City, Missouri, a blend of 4 year old Irish whiskey and their own-make pot still whiskey. A gentle nose of pine bough, fennel seed, citrus oil, licorice, and potpourri, with a veneer of lemon candy. The palate tastes young but sweet and creamy, blending vanilla, bitter orange, and spicy pepper with a raisiny Chunky bar note and chocolate-covered almonds. Finishes with more chocolate, orange, and a subtle nuttiness."
2973,"<price>20<rating>77<whiskey>Canadian Club 100 Proof Export Strength, 50% ABV<review>Hot solvents on the nose, reminiscent of Hinkle’s Easter egg dyes. Heavy-handed sweet wash of caramel, very hot, cloying finish. Not easy to see this as related to the clean innocence of the standard expression.  "
2974,"<price>189<rating>89<whiskey>Glenkinchie 20 year old, 55.1%<review>If Cragganmore is sometimes overlooked, then what of this poor Lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? Again, here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks, but whereas Cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute, this is expressive and lively. The nose, with intense floral notes of lilac blossom, freesia, and chamomile, is a revelation. These are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune. I like its energy, and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy, so for drinking purposes I’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. All in all impressive, with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark."
2975,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>Ransom The Emerald 1865 Batch 1, 43.8%<review>Made from an Irish whiskey recipe from 1865 (“dug up” by David Wondrich), with malt, raw barley, rye malt, and rolled oats, distilled in an alembic pot still. Amber with a distinct red/pink cast to it. Very fruity nose—greengage plum, mulberry, sweet orange—with creamy vanilla. Tastes of sweet cereal with a firm bitter keel; the fruit returns as an echo in the finish. A very craft beer-like whiskey; challenging, interesting, unexpected. A bit brash, but worth investigating."
2976,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Greenbar Slow Hand Six Woods, 42%<review>100% malt whiskey, aged “to taste” in white oak vats (1,000-2,000 gallons!), on toasted cubes of hickory, maple, mulberry, red oak, and grape wood. Pleasantly fruity nose with a firm oak backboard. Malt is dominant on the tongue, a bit shallow, but the woods contribute a bubbling complexity. Unfortunately, things don’t really come together in the finish, but the experiment’s not a loss, given the interesting effects of the multiple woods. Worth a taste."
2977,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Davidson Reserve Small Batch Tennessee Straight Sour Mash, 50%<review>A pleasant nose of spicy, perfumed oak that’s also lightly floral and melds well with notes of coriander and dill, pistachio pudding, and hints of earthiness and minerality. The palate has plenty of spice and heat, with youthful notes of papaya, cinnamon, salt water taffy, bitter chocolate, and young oak. Water unlocks more pronounced cinnamon and a light nuttiness, improving upon a somewhat youthful finish."
2978,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Dewar’s Signature, 43%<review>Johnnie Walker Blue, meet Dewar’s Signature. Signature is Dewar’s introduction into the ultra-premium blended scotch category. Like Johnnie Walker Blue, Signature bears no age statement, but I’m told that a 27 year old Aberfeldy is the heart of the blend. The first release consists only of 1,000 individually numbered bottles, and they’re only available in New York City. I’m always a little skeptical of very expensive blends that come in fancy packages. There are some very good, reasonably priced blends in the 10-20 year old range, and the expensive ones are often only marginally better, if that. But I like this whisky a whole lot better than the standard Dewar’s White Label, and it is also superior to Dewar’s 12 year old-a whisky which I find to be quite enjoyable. While maintaining the Dewar’s profile-nicely balanced-this whisky offers greater depth, maturity, and complexity without being too woody-a creamy, malty foundation makes sure of that. The whisky expresses a rich, honeyed maltiness which combines nicely with notes of golden raisins, vanilla, caramel, and crème brûlée, with just a hint of spicy oak notes for complexity. Signature is a different style when compared to Johnnie Walker Blue-it’s more elegant and bashful-but, like Blue, I put Signature on my short list of the finest blends on the market."
2979,"<price>99<rating>85<whiskey>Tullibardine, 1988 vintage, 46%<review>Similar in personality to its younger standard 1993 and 1992 vintages -- soft and mellow, with fresh barley, vanilla cream puff, cut grass and hay, cookie dough, and a dusting of pencil shavings. The extra aging shows on the whisky’s dried spice and polished oak finish. More sophisticated than its younger siblings, although the younger vintages are more drinkable."
2980,"<price>46<rating>90<whiskey>The MacTarnahan, 15 years old, 46%<review>Amber gold color. Rich, malty aroma with interwoven notes of fruit and oak. Floral note and just the wisp of smoke add complexity. Similar flavors-big and rich-with a long satisfying dryish finish. 
"
2981,"<price>104<rating>90<whiskey>Limeburners Port Cask, 43%<review>Aromas of black grape, sultana, fresh plum, and fennel seed arouse the senses. The Australian port-cask finish coats the bourbon characteristics, enriching rather than saturating, draping raspberry and cherry around caramels and runny honey. Sultana notes pull ahead, the whole experience becoming buttery in the final stretch as the spices balance out. More spice to the fore on the finish, pumping in the pepper while serving up rich cooked fruit. A highly respectable effort. A$135"
2982,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Ballyhoo, 43%<review>Connacht Whiskey Co. finished 4 year old grain whiskey in port barrels for 3 to 6 months in this new and improved recipe. Cherry soda, rose hip, lemon zest, vanilla frosting, and dry grass aromas with a taste of damson, cherry, redcurrant jelly, pepper, and a good lift of sugary sweetness. A potpourri of spices bubbles up in the aftertaste amid lingering trails of fruity sweetness."
2983,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 016), 52.9%<review>A blend of 9 year and 9 month, 11, and 15 year old barrels from Tennessee, Indiana, and Kentucky. The combination creates complexity and balance, starting with an aromatic nose of toasty oak, cherry, cinnamon, nutmeg, dried orange, leather, and cigar ash. The palate follows with notes of semi-sweet chocolate, espresso, peach cobbler, and a hint of coconut. It concludes with a finish of more chocolate and subtle notes of fruit."
2984,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Peg Leg Porker 12 year old Tennessee Straight Bourbon, 46.35%<review>Nashville restaurant Peg Leg Porker’s pitmaster Carey Bringle filters this whiskey through hickory charcoal. Malted milk balls, peanuts in the shell, toasted grain, Swiss Miss hot cocoa mix, licorice, root beer, and tea leaves to start, with lots of oak, dark chocolate, blackberry, white pepper, cinnamon, cherry cough syrup, and more root beer on the sweet, spiced palate. The finish is delicate and fruited with sweet cherries and blackberries, as well as a sprinkling of cloves and subtle oak."
2985,"<price>20<rating>78<whiskey>Highland Queen, 40%<review>The range begins with this entry-level whisky, aged for 3 years. Aromas of pale toffee, vanilla, and scented, herbaceous notes can be found on the nose. It has a light, silky texture and comprises flavors of stewed fruits, with a slight bitterness behind them. Plum and coffee notes expand, though it remains tart through to the buzzy finish, which is lifted by hints of chocolate. A robust and pugnacious dram."
2986,"<price>52<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Elgin 12 year old, 43%<review>The least well-known of the Fogwatt trio which includes Longmorn and BenRiach, it’s unlikely that Glen Elgin will become a major brand anytime soon, given how important it is to blenders. A combination of long, slow ferments, and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit, which here is bulging with ripe peach, apricot, and Galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg, given thick weight by the worm tubs. A classic. £34"
2987,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Big Peat Fèis Ìle 2018, 48%<review>Well-balanced offering of sweet citrus, grapefruit peel, and beach bonfire smoke. Cream, lemon, and lime zest are overcome by smoke as the chili spice and pepper go off like a rocket. More disciplined, it settles down to sweet orange, lemon bonbon, cocoa, and driftwood smoke. An incredibly pale whisky, it’s punchy, but not overly complex, although it does include some fun stickers to let you customize your own bottle. (3,000 bottles)"
2988,"<price>56<rating>93<whiskey>Filibuster Single Barrel Straight Bourbon, 58.5%<review>Scan the dessert case and choose your favorite, because they’re all here in abundance: cake donuts, sticky buns, pralines, cocoa-dusted truffles, and strawberry tarts on the nose. Espresso, tea, and spice notes add some gravitas to the palate, which is chewy and oak forward, but dark fruit, milk chocolate, and sweet pecans and peanuts maintain balance. The finish is a dream, lengthy and well-developed, with nutmeg, chai spice, toasted oak, tea leaf, milk chocolate, and boysenberry."
2989,"<price>16<rating>68<whiskey>Southern Shine Blueberry Moonshine, 50%<review>All of the elements that work with Southern Shine’s Apple Pie bottling don’t work with their Blueberry. An extremely evasive nose leads to an artificially-flavored palate. Here the blueberry tastes more like flavored bubblegum than fruit. The white pepper from the base spirit clashes with the berry like a multi-car pileup. The finish is hot, too dry, and a little sour. There’s just nothing about this that’s pleasant or enjoyable."
2990,"<price>140<rating>88<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Ben Nevis) 15 year old Highland 1998 (cask #1589), 51.1%<review>A 15 year old port cask-matured Ben Nevis that is as genre-defying as it gets. Deep port notes combine with strong iodine, honey, and malt in an inviting nose. This whisky simply roars on the palate, with big jammy fruit combined with salt, iodine, and a dash of smoke. Everything comes together in the mid-palate, with an alluring core of ginger, honey, and malt. A long, flavorful finish wraps up a whisky with unique character and unmistakable appeal. (U.S. only)"
2991,"<price>52<rating>91<whiskey>Bowmore 12 year old, 40%<review>A great introduction to Bowmore’s single malts, and one of the best 12 year old single malt scotches around. The nose offers tropical fruit, sweet smoke, a hint of brine, new leather, and floral notes. Peaches, honey, vanilla, and more full-on smoke on the rounded palate. Brine, cocoa powder, citrus fruits, and fading woodsmoke in the finish."
2992,"<price>85<rating>93<whiskey>Glenmorangie Astar, 57.1%<review>Astar’s flavor profile is similar to Glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects, showing a superb balance of sweetness, fruit, and spice. It’s not as subtle as the 10 year old expression, but it is creamier, richer, and fleshier, with loads of honeyed vanilla, coconut cream pie, toasted almond, vibrant spice (cinnamon, mint), and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. The fact that it is bottled at 100 British Proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. Imagine Glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. I don’t rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. This whisky has certainly earned it."
2993,"<price>77<rating>78<whiskey>Inchmurrin 15 year old, 46%<review>Inchmurrin is one of many single malts produced by Loch Lomond. It is made using lightly peated malt and matured in bourbon casks, and is named after one of the islands in Loch Lomond. Caramac chocolate and peanut butter on the sweet, fruity nose. The fruit motif continues on to the palate, where spicy malt, vanilla, and ripe peaches predominate. The finish is medium in length and nutty. £50"
2994,"<price>26<rating>83<whiskey>Wolfhead Craft, 40%<review>Reminiscent of old-style sherry malts, with round, mellow, oaky notes and a dusty, waxy, farmy feel that evolves into dark fruit and striking gunpowder on the nose. Odd and enticing. The oily palate shows taffy, blistering white pepper, fresh pine sawdust, and ripe fruits, with chocolatey suggestions of Tootsie Rolls. Starts big, then moves to a quick, spicy-hot resolution. People who think all-wheat whisky is mild or weak really need to try this luscious beauty. $35 CAD"
2995,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>Crown Royal XO, 40%<review>A rich luxurious whisky finished in cognac casks, as was the crisper, brighter Cask No. 16 that it replaces. This is the cedary, leathery, tobacco-ish sipping whisky of the private club. Simple toffee and the cherry essence of Beaujolais nouveau evolve into ripe red apples and heavy, dusky, dark fruit with candied citrus peel, bitter almond skins, and hints of oak. Sizzling gingery spice and white pepper linger over textured sandalwood. Defined by its heavy, creamy body."
2996,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Writers’ Tears Copper Pot Deau XO Cognac Cask Finish, 46%<review>Toffee apple, nutmeg, sanded oak, and plenty of feisty spices behind the nose. The flavor is more refined with greater complexity; not overly sweet or fruity, but a smooth-as-satin mouthfeel with shades of pear, caramel covered in white chocolate, nuts, pleasant pot still spiciness, rich toffee, cocoa, and red chili. The cognac cask influence is gentle and works well, and it concludes with a hazelnut butter finish."
2997,"<price>89<rating>85<whiskey>Tullibardine Sherry Wood Finish, 1993 vintage, 46%<review>This whisky starts with the light and very drinkable bourbon oak-aged 1993 vintage from previous years and then is finished off in a sherry cask. The sherry is fresh and vibrant, and adds lush fruit, light dates, and nutty undertone to Tullibardine’s classic vanilla, honeyed malt, and grassy notes. Delicious!
"
2998,"<price>175<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey 17 year old Master’s Keep Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Oak always leads the character of well-aged bourbon, sometimes dominating it, but here the balance is just right. The nose gives an impression of sweet syrupy fruit, like candied orange peel and cherries jubilee; there’s also creamy flan, dusty spice, cocoa powder, and leather bookbindings. Richly oaked and dense with flavor, the palate has dark chocolate, roasted walnuts, cola, black currant jam, and peppermint. It finishes generously with mint-flavored dark chocolate, blackberry jam, and coffee bean. Skip the water. (14,400 bottles)"
2999,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. Cider Cask Finished (Batch #3), 46%<review>Autumn in a glass: dried apples, earthy leaves, marzipan, grilled pears, and white pepper mingle with lemon-herb tea, saline, and a whiff of incense. Malty, with a pleasant oiliness, the palate showcases lemon peel, juicy clementine, poached pears, grilled apples, chamomile, salt water taffy, and a delicate, perfumed savoriness—almonds in rice pilaf. Complex and balanced, with a lengthy oak finish. Virginia Distillery Co. combines its own single malt with blended malt from the Highlands of Scotland. Batch 2 of Cider Cask Finished scored 90 points, indicating strong consistency. Number 13 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
3000,"<price>180<rating>83<whiskey>Blackadder 'Raw Cask' (distilled at Bruichladdich) Cask #841 1986 vintage, 54.4%<review>A very fruity “Laddie,” flowing with tangerine, apricot, pineapple and pear. Background notes of honey, vanilla, and a wisp of smoke. The typical Bruichladdich fresh, appetizing, brine notes are restrained, emerging ever so subtly on the finish. Nicely rounded and clean throughout."
3001,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Compass Box Eleuthera, 46%<review>Bright gold color. Fresh aromas of smoked olives, brine, exotic pepper, and fried bacon. Rich in body, and slightly oily in texture. In flavor, this is a big, dynamic whisky-smoked olives, sea salt, seaweed, mustard seed, all on a backdrop of vanilla sweetness. Long, smoky finish. 
"
3002,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Wiser’s 22 year old Cask Strength Port Cask-Finished, 59.7%<review>Very aromatic with fruit leather, red fruit, mild caramel, hints of oak, and slight nose prickle. A lush, sweet, fruity palate restrained by peach pits, earthy tones, and mild oakiness develops hints of spent shotgun shells that could sometimes be found in very old sherried malts. A pleasing glow turns hot and peppery before gradually fading into unusually enjoyable rich red grape skins. Long, complex, and well-balanced."
3003,"<price>130<rating>90<whiskey>Ardbeg Supernova (2010 Release), 60.1%<review>Very dynamic, complex, and powerful. Here’s what I’m picking up, in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke, coal tar, mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips, smoked olive, peppered seaweed salad, fruit (lemon, lime), genever, brine-tinged grass, and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). Compared to last year’s debut release of Supernova, this one is certainly comparable, but I feel it’s a tad richer, with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. It also seems a bit more polished, less aggressive. I like it a little more than its predecessor (rated 89)."
3004,"<price>42<rating>82<whiskey>Filibuster Dual Cask Bourbon Batch No. 1, 45%<review>Aged in new charred oak, then finished in “white wine-seasoned French oak.” Tight, sawdusty, bitter nose. A lot of wood here, going in different directions. First hit is the American oak (vanilla, rich spice), followed quickly by creamy French oak, then comes a wave of fruity wine wood character. Full in the mouth, and a thick finish. Interesting, but not particularly well integrated; maybe a case of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” Sourced whiskey."
3005,"<price>50<rating>95<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 2005 release, 45%<review>(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15, No. 1.) A wonderfully crisp, clean rye for 18 years old (or any age, for that matter), with incredible depth and balance. A perennial classic. 
"
3006,"<price>55<rating>92<whiskey>Hyde No. 4 President’s Cask Rum Cask Finish, 46%<review>I’ve yet to taste any Hyde whiskey that I haven’t loved, and this may be their best yet. A wave of soft, sweet caramel and toffee, light vanilla, fresh apricot, zesty citrus, rum notes, and an agreeable mix of aromatic spices. Buttery soft mouthfeel with butterscotch sweetness, banana custard, vanilla, and gentle spices. Very approachable and dessert-like, the spices becoming slightly more assertive than the sweetness on the finish."
3007,"<price>50<rating>81<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Rested Tennessee Rye, 40%<review>Continuing progress on Jack Daniel’s rye whiskey; this one is 2 years old and labeled “straight.” Pale amber. New make sharpness, sawn oak, hard candy, and a flip of cinnamon bark: driven, simple, insistent nose. Thin on the palate: sweet, with an oily overlay of bitter grass and grainy flatness. A dry, contracting finish. Not flawed, but not particularly pleasant, either. Someone tell Jack; craft distillers get $50 for young rye because they’re small. JD should be half that."
3008,"<price>65<rating>81<whiskey>Bruichladdich Laddie Eight 8 year old, 50%<review>Another Travel Retail exclusive, and while you might expect something delicate given the age statement, what is delivered is a thick, buttery/creamy opening that, for a second, teeters on the brink of sourness then pulls back to be more like ricotta cheese. It then settles into vanilla, floral notes, white chocolate, and sweet barley. The palate is thick once again, with lemon cheesecake giving a needed clean acidity. Quite a bulky youngster that’s best with water. (Travel Retail exclusive) £45"
3009,"<price>500<rating>88<whiskey>St. George 35th Anniversary, 41%<review>A perfumed nose of lilac, mint, orange flower water, and powdery Sweethearts candy introduces this pretty whiskey, as distinctive tangerine citrus meets papaya and tropical flavors. The malty palate is broad, sweet, and pure, delivering some bubble gum and confectionery notes. Very enjoyable, and almost juicy in its fruit bomb of flavors."
3010,"<price>27<rating>93<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel (Barrel No. 1) 2004, 43.3%<review>Polished and nicely balanced, with caramel as the main note, followed by candied fruit, soft vanilla, sweet corn, and nougat. Subtle spice (ginger, cinnamon) and gentle oak on the finish round out the sweet notes. Easygoing demeanor and very drinkable. Great value too! A very pleasing, versatile bourbon. Value Pick."
3011,"<price>17<rating>67<whiskey>Southern Comfort Fiery Pepper, 35%<review>Does a nose of bright bubble gum and fresh-cut peppers touched by the fermented heat of Tabasco sound good? It comes bursting out of the glass with this one, busy and hot. The taste hits first with the bubble gum blast, sweet and light, even quickly pleasant until the pepper breaks in, twisting and warping this liqueur with a whirl of sweet, hot, bitter, vegetal flavors that turns to a sticky-sweet heat in the finish.   A regrettably bad idea."
3012,"<price>130<rating>82<whiskey>Knob Creek 2001 (Batch 1), 50%<review>Highly anticipated, this release offers freshly-popped kettle corn, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak, hints of fruit and floral. Then it feels unbalanced, a bitter woodiness hiding hopeful flavors. Once the wood disappears there’s caramel, vanilla, and baking spice over heat. A drop of water corrects the dominant oak and gives this a sipper’s chance."
3013,"<price>105<rating>85<whiskey>Kornog Sant Ivy 2011, 57.8%<review>This is another young peated whisky, but the earthy and dusty smoke is wrapped around a honeycomb and milk chocolate center. It’s both rugged and comforting, the whisky equivalent of chili chocolate: a bittersweet love affair for those who enjoy the contrary nature of sweet and savory. €77 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
3014,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Redemption High Rye Straight Bourbon (Batch 122), 46%<review>The nose offers caramel custard, chocolate, and maple syrup. An oak-driven palate has lots of heat and integrated spice, but is also loaded with chocolate, coffee beans, almonds, and maple syrup. The finish is the best part, with rich notes of chocolate, coffee, and spice, but plenty of finesse. Water brings out more chocolate on a slightly tart but rich finish. Lots of assertive flavors, but with a gentle, smooth texture."
3015,"<price>350<rating>91<whiskey>Brora, 25 year old, 56.3%<review>Quite lively for 25 years, with layers of bright fruit (lemon, nectarine, grapefruit, pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. There’s a peppering of dried spice, smoldering ember, and beach pebbles. Lightly smoky, dried spice finish. Very nice. Brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed, but the prices of the whisky from this shuttered distillery are creeping up.
"
3016,"<price>72<rating>89<whiskey>Nikka Coffey Malt, 45%<review>Now a hugely welcome part of the core range, this whisky—made in Coffey stills at the Miyagikyo distillery—uses 100% malted barley as its base. The nose is all tinned peach, tropical fruit juice, and baked banana, with a surprising green celery note, coconut, and sherbet. The palate is silky, with some chocolate, biscuity oak, and orange blossom honey. Water brings those green notes forward to add freshness to the peach cobbler sweetness. The grain revolution builds. £43"
3017,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Booker’s 2020-02 “Boston Batch” Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 63.25%<review>Sweet toasted grain, almonds, frozen banana on a Popsicle stick, vanilla, and green tea on the nose. Without water, the palate is overwhelmed by its proof; add a generous amount and you’ll find vanilla, almonds, toasted grain, sweet oak, green banana, and the freshness of mint leaves. The finish is sweet and velvety, with more almonds, toasted grain, and oak. Atypical profile for Booker’s, but plenty to like."
3018,"<price>87<rating>84<whiskey>The English Whisky Co. Classic, 53.4%<review>A marvelous red British telephone box adorns the label. A nose of pulped lemon and lime, pineapple, hard candy, and Bramley applesauce certainly makes this a fruit-led proposition. It caresses the tongue with soft, boiled apples and lemon cake flavors, marking a crescendo in the perception of its strength; peaking with tropical fruits and touches of acidity pinching in from the periphery. Spicy heat, icing sugars, fig paste, and hints of bitterness round off the finish. (270 bottles, The Whisky Exchange only) £60"
3019,"<price>129<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Seville Bazaar 1991 (distilled at Glen Scotia), 46%<review>From a refill sherry butt, this bottling of Glen Scotia was released in September 2015 as a 24 year old. Oily on the nose, with dirty sherry, ginger, chili, coconut, new leather, and cocoa. The palate is viscous with treacle, dark berries, licorice, and more chili. Gingery and drying in the finish, with white salt and developing black pepper. (737 bottles) £90"
3020,"<price>47<rating>94<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 12 year old wheated bourbon from floor #5, 45%<review>Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Nicely balanced flavors, and complex. Spices dance on the palate (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), balanced by underlying caramel and butterscotch, and subtle honeyed orchard fruit. Lingering, well-rounded finish. A fabulous wheated bourbon!  Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice."
3021,"<price>322<rating>89<whiskey>Bruichladdich Black Art 4 23 year old, 49.2%<review>A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200"
3022,"<price>395<rating>91<whiskey>Glenglassaugh 30 year old, 44.8%<review>The first release from the new owners of Glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression, and it does not disappoint. Due in the States next year. Damp moss and cedar on the early nose. Sultanas, candied orange, maraschino cherries, and sherry. Treacle notes in time. Spicy fruits, figs, brittle toffee, sherry, and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. The finish is medium in length, with allspice and old oak, plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245"
3023,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Ohishi Single Sherry (cask 1257), 43.3%<review>This dark dram is distilled from malted and unmalted rice along the Kuma river in Hitoyoshi. The nose is redolent of stewed prunes, raisins, plum wine, and walnut, with a palate of treacle, molasses, burnt sugar, licorice, prune, dark fruits, mocha, praline, and nuttier elements. Skillfully, it never veers into bitterness. This should rock the boat for those who love a huge sherried-style whisky. (506 bottles)"
3024,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Royal Lochnagar 12 year old, 40%<review>House Baratheon is represented with a label depicting a crown-wearing rampant stag. An undemanding dram, with soft toffee, cream, baked apples, and a hint of ginger on the nose. The palate is light, with brittle toffee, soft fruit notes, and oak. Drying in the finish, through aniseed and wood spice."
3025,"<price>100<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan Blood Oak, 46%<review>A non-chill filtered bottling matured in a mixture of bourbon and red wine casks. The nose offers a big early orange hit, vanilla, and red wine notes. Smooth on the palate; more orange, black pepper, and spicy red wine.  The finish is relatively long and spicy, with bitter chocolate orange. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
3026,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Old Hickory Great American Bourbon, 43%<review>MGP bourbon aged to 4 years. Sweet and brittle nose, hot and a bit spicy, but thin. More spice and body on the tongue than the Old Hickory Blended, and a more balanced finish, but still a relatively light whiskey. Beautiful bottle, classic label; I wish there was more whiskey here. Sourced whiskey."
3027,"<price>800<rating>92<whiskey>Springbank 25 year old (2019 Release), 46%<review>The nose features peat, ozone, malt, sherry, mango, charcuterie, and an herbal note. Overt sherry and rum on the palate, with pineapple, caramel, worn leather, and bonfire smoke. The finish is long and earthy, with chocolate and spicy oak. (160 bottles for U.S.)"
3028,"<price>21<rating>69<whiskey>Cabin Fever, 40%<review>Real maple syrup has an earthy, woodsy aroma; maple flavoring has strong overtones of coconut, and so does Cabin Fever. The nose evokes dried, sweetened baking coconut, while the sweet and spicy palate is a hot, liquid, coconut macaroon. Peppery notes suggest that it’s whisky, but without any traces of barrel aging that’s as close as you get. Best part? The long, spicy finish with its confection-sweet coconut."
3029,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>New Riff Backsetter Peated Backset Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Made in the sour mash style, by adding in some of the backset—the liquid that’s strained from the spent mash after distillation. This particular backset is from a mash of peated malted barley, and the result is an earthy whiskey with spiced accents that meld with sweeter flavors of candied grapes and dark fruits. The finish is long, smooth, and rich, with back notes of spice and cracked pepper. (2,250 bottles)"
3030,"<price>130<rating>94<whiskey>Bowmore 18 year old, 43%<review>This 18 year old is aged in a mix of bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is redolent of a damped-down bonfire, with stewed fruit, wood spice, and pipe tobacco. There are red berries, subtle peat, a hint of iodine, and soft oak on the complex palate. The finish yields more tobacco, oak, rich peat, and spicy dark chocolate."
3031,"<price>78<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Garioch Vintage 1997, 56.7%<review>The first Glen Garioch vintage to be exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and also the only one so far to post-date the closure of  their on-site floor maltings. This leads to a less peaty note in the spirit than in other vintages. Matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. Tinned peaches in syrup and nougat on the nose. Sweet malt, heather honey, vanilla, restrained cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger on the palate. Subtle oak notes in the lengthy finish. £50"
3032,"<price>78<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Deveron 16 year old, 40%<review>Sweet on the nose, with malt, stewed apple, apricots, sherry, and warm spices. Finally, caramel. Quite viscous in the mouth; the palate continues the sweet, malty, spicy theme. Ginger and soft fruits in the medium-length finish. Straightforward and very drinkable. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £46/liter"
3033,"<price>124<rating>88<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glenrothes) 1990 20 year old, 58.6%<review>The nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. As it opens, out comes argan oil. This constantly changing array of aromas is very Glenrothes, as is the vanilla lift when water is added, which comes with added cordite. The palate is very sweet, filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. The finish, long. £79"

A nose of blossom honey, fresh cherries, banana cream pie, licorice, and spice is followed by a palate that’s delicate and creamy, with notes of vanilla frosting, orange, peanuts, marshmallow, and light pepper spice. Tobacco leaf on the finish, with cherry, oak, and understated spice. A sturdy, finessed exemplar of Tennessee style."
3035,"<price>162<rating>83<whiskey>Hakushu Sherry Cask, 48%<review>Verging on the opaque, with a powerful resinous hit bringing to mind a luthier’s workshop with added Morello cherry, Turkish delight, and bitter chocolate, but on the tongue it is surprisingly sweet rather than tannic, with a supple feel, albeit with dried fruits dominating. This is a great example of what a small amount of heavy sherry can give to a vatting, but is it Hakushu? Sherry bomb lovers will adore it. £100"
3036,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Benromach 10 year old, 43%<review>This expression was distilled from malt peated to 12 to 14 ppm, and aged for 9 years in 80% bourbon and 20% sherry casks before a final year in more sherry casks. Sweet smoke on the early nose, with malt, vanilla, quite dry sherry, apple, and toffee. Smoky barley, vanilla, subtle sherry, and light honey on the palate. Peaches, ginger, and woodsmoke on the medium-length finish. Very accomplished. Editors' Choice"
3037,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old, 46%<review>Sulfury funk on the nose might intimidate, but it’s a harbinger of the whisky’s strong sherry influence. There are also aromas of cinnamon, allspice, tangy stewed fruit, roasted almonds, and saline. The palate is intensely floral, with raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, red berries, and a little milk chocolate. Richly flavored, but light-bodied; a gentle sherried whisky. (Total Wine & More)"
3038,"<price>72<rating>85<whiskey>Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 2, 46%<review>Canada’s sub-arctic Yukon Territory has become fertile ground for making whisky. Blended from a mix of barrels distilled in 2009, then finished in Pedro Ximenez sherry barrels, Two Brewers Release 2 shows multi-layered complexity. Lovely sherry notes meld into rich malty grain. Sweet and warming, with tinges of sandalwood, apples, and exotic fruits. Silky mouthfeel, finishing on the vaguest notions of wildflower honey and wintergreen. (Canada only) C$95"

The entry level 12 year old offers a relatively light, zesty nose, with citrus fruit, vanilla, and ginger, while the palate yields more citrus fruit and vanilla, honey, sweet oak, and dark chocolate. Cantaloupe and wood spice in the finish."
3040,"<price>30<rating>92<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates Angel City Brewing Co. Edition, 40%<review>A brilliant collaboration with the Los Angeles craft brewery, the nose has red apple, dry grasses, orange pith, toasted bakery goods, and background spices. The beer influence is every bit as good as Caskmates IPA. The palate is classic Jameson: honeyed, soft, light fruit, vanilla, and peppercorn, developing a wonderful creaminess, dark orange, further spices, and lastly, chocolate notes. Glowing and kind of dreamy."
3041,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Heaven’s Door 10 year old Tennessee Bourbon, 50%<review>Bit-O-Honey candies, spearmint, and beeswax introduce this seductively sweet whiskey. On the palate, more honey notes, green apple Jolly Rancher, and grape jelly continue the vivid sweetness, augmented by the sweet nuttiness of marzipan and honey peanut butter. A nicely executed and pretty whiskey, finishing with candied almonds."
3042,"<price>45<rating>80<whiskey>John Myer Wheat, 45%<review>Furniture polish, red raspberries, popovers, a vigorous nose, going in several directions. Hot grainy mouth, not overwhelmed by wood; a simple grain finish like twice-baked biscuits, with a light wreathing of meadow mint. The character of the grain comes through quite clearly, and it’s distinctly different from the Myer Rye. But what’s here is not particularly interesting or well-integrated."
3043,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Crown Royal, 40%<review>Light and easy drinking. Very clean on the palate, with notes of creamy vanilla, subtle fruit, and delicate floral notes. Light, clean finish. When I think of Canadian whisky, this is the whisky that comes to mind."

Pleasantly sweet pineapple and citrus keep things bright on the palate, along with flavors of chocolate-covered banana. The final show of dusty oak tannins is laced with bitter espresso, then cocoa powder, ending with hints of furniture polish. An intense volley of flavors, skillfully integrated."
3046,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Copperworks American Single Malt (release 001), 52%<review>The appealing nose features pretty biscuit notes, great purity of malt, and golden, honeyed sweetness, before adding some flavors of citrus blossom, clover, and cardamom with hints of licorice. On the palate, the initial sweet malt quickly turns herbal, with marjoram and a distinct sage note that lingers through a long finish of salt-tinged sweetness. Aged 2 years, 6 months in full-size charred oak."

Waves of coastal character, with lemon, vanilla, marzipan, peat smoke, and hints of antiseptic.

3048,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Booker’s 30th Anniversary, 62.9%<review>This is a whiskey that knows exactly what it wants to be, a rambunctious bourbon that throws the full weight of its barrel behind a flavor-packed punch. Lots of dry, charred-matchstick oak meets chewy fig and dried fruits, fudge brownie, and fresh meadow, with hints of banana and furniture polish in the aroma. Brawny and unapologetic on the palate; peach syrup and baked apples meet a torrent of spices as the moreish finish oozes on like chocolate lava cake. Collectible"

Powdered sugar, glazed donuts, candied nuts, cherry, blackberry, and vanilla custard punctuate the nose. A rich, spiced palate offers notes of grape jelly and allspice, while water unlocks semi-sweet chocolate, licorice, honey-coated almonds, and toasted oak. A long finish anchored by balanced oak offers raspberry tart, baking spice, maple syrup, and tiramisu."
3050,"<price>84<rating>82<whiskey>Glenlivet Nadurra Oloroso, 48%<review>I’m a fan of the original Nadurra’s freshness, which maximizes Glenlivet’s apple blossom and pineapple perfume. This pleasantly funky new brother has been matured wholly in oloroso, which adds (very) sweet sherry, nougat, blackcurrant, grilled pear, and malt. While the palate starts well, with mixed red and black fruits (and a little grapefruit), the sherry adds thickness from back palate on and the distillery slides away. Pleasant, but a tale of two halves. (Travel Retail exclusive) £50 "
3051,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>J.J. Renfield & Sons 8 year old, 40%<review>A surprisingly tasty “buyers own brand” of unknown origin. Its lush, fruity, caramel-rich nose foreshadows a sweet, mouth-coating luxury. Baskets of orchard fruits and bowls of stewed fruit are accented by cinnamon, mild ginger root, and spicy white pepper. The round, syrupy mouth feel carries right into a creamy but gently bitter, glowing hot finish. Meticulously well-balanced and the very definition of smooth."

The palate is nutty up front, followed by orange peel, vanilla, tobacco leaf, cinnamon, roasted walnuts, and toasted oak. Water brings out brighter, racier flavors of chocolate. The finish is golden apples, honey, bitter chocolate, roasted pecans, and a balanced, rich sweetness."

This distillery is located amongst the fertile barley-growing fields of the Laich O’Moray. Though modern in look, it actually dates back to 1810. This is a classic introduction to its fresh, zesty style, which plays an important role in the Ballantine’s blends. Think cut grass, green apple, pine, pear drops, and a whiff of freshly-starched linen. This energy carries on to the mouth where apple is the dominant flavor, along with green walnut and a zippy acidity. £34 "
3056,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Cragganmore 10 year old, 60.1%<review>Very dry, fragrant and spicy. Medium bodied, but firm. Initial, flirtatious notes of honey, creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid, with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. The whisky is peppered throughout with notes of anise, coffee, dried herbs and undertones of Madeira. Very forward and bullishly dry for its age, and more intense than the standard Cragganmore bottling. It’s rare for a whisky this young to be so complex.

On the full-bodied palate, stewed fruit and oak vie for pride of place, with baking spice, butterscotch, and lemon and orange peel urging restraint. The finish is hot and centers on toasted oak, stewed apples, and nuts; cloying at times. (16,500 bottles)"

This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla, ripe bananas, honey, a wisp of smoke, and soft spices.  Toffee, malt, vanilla, a biscuit-like note, more bananas, and new leather on the palate, closing with a lengthy, spicy finish."

Cherry, cranberry, strawberry, raspberry sorbet, plum skin, juicy sultana, sweet barley notes, and a smudge of fine spices indicate the influence of the Israeli red wine casks. The palate is fruity but not sweet, with red grape, pepper, malt, vinous notes, and ascendant peppery oak spices, then a dry finish of vanilla cream, raspberry cordial, and spices. Delicious, but after the first sip, further flavor shifts are subtle."

The ‘finishing’ casks are ex-Sauternes barriques. Lemonade, icing sugar, vanilla, nougat, and maple on the nose. Progressively sweeter. Rich and sweet on the palate, notably fruity, with spicy orange and brittle toffee. Medium length finish, with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39"
3061,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Tincup American Whiskey, 42%<review>A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and a small amount of Colorado single malt.

3062,"<price>275<rating>80<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Caol Ila) 29 year old, 53.2%<review>Quite hot on the nose, with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. The effect is of dried fish and seaweed, Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water. In the mouth it’s tense when neat, giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. Firm and bold, but even with water it’s a little too dry."
3063,"<price>58<rating>87<whiskey>Old Pulteney Huddart, 46%<review>This NAS expression is part of the new 2018 Old Pulteney core lineup. Initially matured in second-fill American oak and bourbon casks, it was finished in bourbon casks that previously held heavily peated whisky. Sweet woodsmoke, crème brûlée, green apples, and cinder toffee on the nose. The smoke is more peat-induced on the palate, with banana fritters, and subtly sprinkled with sea salt. The finish features caramel and herbal notes."
3064,"<price>120<rating>79<whiskey>Auchentoshan 17 year old Bordeaux Wine Finish, 51%<review>A peculiar Auchentoshan. The Bordeaux wine dominates, with its distinctive winery aroma and flavor. Red raspberry, red currant, and a hint of strawberry comprise the core of this whisky, with underlying notes of vanilla cream, cocoa, and a hint of demerara rum. The whisky spent nine of its years in Bordeaux wine casks. I would have preferred less time in the wine casks for such a delicate whisky."
3065,"<price>350<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 30 Year Old, 48.1%<review>An exemplary Highland Park. There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks, and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee, fruit (lemon, plum, blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate, with emerging notes of heather, nougat, lavender, delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus, providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place."

Pleasantly hot with sweet spices and fruit market aromas. Very pleasant esters, hints of acetone and pepper, it fades into corn syrup and traces of cinnamon. More woodiness would raise the score.

Dried apples, a little currant, but also a pure thread of sweetness. In time, a little fresh mushroom. Complex. Soft on the tongue, so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. Later becomes minty, with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. Water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. I’d probably keep water on the side. Excellent.

The finish is medium to long, with spicy sherry."
3070,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>Talisker Select Reserve, 45.8%<review>Part of the Game of Thrones collection, this pop culture mash-up whisky represents House Greyjoy and features its kraken sigil on the label. The whisky sings of the sea, as blasts of ocean spray, sea salt, wet sand, and seashells swirl above undernotes of peach, cranberry, citrus fruits, and blackberry tart. The mouth fills with bonfire smoke, light peat, toffee, black cherry, and peppercorn. The addition of water coaxes out chocolate, light black pepper notes, and citrus. A flourish of allspice, bitter chocolate, more toffee, espresso, and almond on the finish. Number 13 in the 2019 Top 20 "
3071,"<price>21<rating>82<whiskey>Two Stars, 43%<review>Simple nose of sweet cornbread and oaky caramel; nothing fancy, but nothing wrong. The nose is no liar; same tastes in the
mouth, just a bit hotter on the oak. Good finish with a nice oaky linger. The letdown is the thin body, which adds to the heat and steals from the experience. Seems more like a good shot bourbon or an “…and ginger ale” bourbon, not a sipping bourbon. Sourced whiskey."

It is approximately 1 year old, and quite dark. There’s a medicinal, dark pit fruit nose, overripe plum with some lighter red plum notes, a soft sweetness around the edges, and a hint of small barrel oak. Wow. Surprisingly smooth, up-front rye flavors, cushioned with a pleasantly odd sweetness with notes of cocoa and a soft rye finish. Intriguing."

A replacement for the 10 year old Curiositas, this was aged in a combination of bourbon, Jamaican rum, and toasted virgin oak casks. The early nose yields light peat smoke, with hand-rolled tobacco, then tropical fruit and cigarette ash. On the palate there’s stone fruit, spices, vanilla, new leather, smoldering peat, and dark chocolate. The finish offers oak, black pepper, salt, and earthy peat."

The nose is malty, bitter, and nutty, offering fragrances of burnt coffee beans and mocha, with undernotes of blackberry compote. A bitter yet delicious palate brings more burnt coffee beans, chili pepper, smoked meat, toasty oatmeal, and dark chocolate. A lengthy finish reprises those notes, adding orange and strawberry when water is added. Dares to be different and succeeds magnificently—expressive and mouthwatering."

Elegant and creamy on the nose, with vanilla, coconut, grass, and suggestions of bourbon. Similar on the palate, but more reserved. Becoming dry on the finish with lingering charred oak. I think the slightly austere oaky finish detracts from what otherwise would be a very nice blend. The best part of this whiskey is the nose."

Candied corn and cinnamon butter develop into a medium to long finish. (36,000 bottles)"
3078,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach Septendecim 17 year old, 46%<review>No hiding that this is one of BenRiach’s peated variants, with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire, but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire, before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. The interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee, nougat, peach syrup, and salty licorice before the smoke returns. A belter. And a great price."
3079,"<price>4640<rating>92<whiskey>Glengoyne 35 year old, 46.8%<review>Glengoyne 35 year old has been aged in sherry casks and just 500 decanters have been released. The nose offers sweet sherry, maraschino cherries, honey, sponge cake, marzipan, and soft fudge, turning to caramel in time, with a whiff of worn leather. Slick in the mouth, with spicy dried fruit, and more marzipan and cherries. Long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. Finally a buttery, bourbon-like note. No negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram."
3080,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Westland Garryana American Single Malt (Batch 4|1), 50%<review>The nose says gentle and light: banana cream pie, Nilla wafer, lemon custard, bubble gum, pineapple soda, blanched almonds, white flowers, pistachio, and graham cracker crust. But the palate is rich and robust, with nuts, tobacco, mocha, gingerbread, and vibrant spice to counter the banana, almond, and vanilla-chocolate shake sweetness. The finish is short but satisfying, with spiced pecans, cigar, semi-sweet chocolate, and mocha. (3,750 bottles)"
3081,"<price>41<rating>87<whiskey>Filibuster Straight Rye Dual Cask Finished, 45%<review>The nose begins with an aroma of orange peel, followed by a lively parade of black pepper, rye spice, cardamom, and tilled earth, then sweeter back notes of molasses and cinnamon stick. There’s pleasant heat and spice on the palate, starting with black pepper and then chocolate, powdered-sugar French toast, orange, treacle, cooked apple, and allspice. A lengthy, toasty, chocolaty finish, with another pleasant note of orange and some peppery spice."
3082,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>New Holland Double Down Barley Brewers' Whiskey, 45%<review>Brazen stuff, blowing raw, fresh-sawn oak (six months in small, heavy char barrels) and cocoa/caramel right out of the glass. For all its youth, it's drinkable; hot, assertively oaky, but drinkable, thanks to the glowing depth of malt character in the glass. The oak's buoyed by rich, cocoa-tinged toffee, and the finish is like a very good hot chocolate. It's going like crazy; love to see where it would be in four years. Limited edition of 500 bottles. Price per 375 ml."
3083,"<price>57<rating>86<whiskey>Last Straw Straight Ontario Rye, 43%<review>Last Straw’s inaugural whisky is a humdinger of a 100% rye, with oodles of oomph and a pleasing balance of grain and barrel notes. Youthfully malty, it shows rye spices, dry hay, barrel tones, hot black licorice, some citrus notes, and candied fruit. Hints of butterscotch and vanilla temper black pepper and sweet pine pitch. Lots of nuances for a 3 year old. The flavor sings at bottle strength. $75 CAD "
3084,"<price>5000<rating>94<whiskey>Michter’s Celebration Sour Mash (Bottle #108), 58.4%<review>A blend of three rye and three bourbon barrels ranging from 10 to 33 years old. Powerful and mouth-coating. Initially, a French bakery, with caramel, vanilla, and torched brown sugar dominating. Then, more complex notes, such as cinnamon roll, coconut, chocolate, slight hints of oak, allspice, hints of smoked paprika, chipotle, roasted almond, and Polish sweet bread. A long finish offers fruit and nutmeg. Tasty sipper at the perfect proof."
3085,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Hooten Young 12 year old Whiskey (Batch 1), 46%<review>Honey crackers, cornbread, and floral notes introduce this highly distinctive whiskey. The palate is sweet and oily in texture, with a nice warming ginger note. The mouthfeel is creamy and polished, as vanilla and marshmallow carry through the finish with only a gentle impression of wood. Made from 99% corn and 1% barley and aged in used casks."
3086,"<price>250<rating>88<whiskey>Macallan Estate, 43%<review>Distilled with a portion of barley grown on the distillery’s Easter Elchies estate. The nose detects quite intense sherry, plus black forest cake, then warm leather and fresh-squeezed orange juice. Full sherry notes on the palate, with new leather, marzipan, cherry liqueur, furniture polish, and dark chocolate. The finish yields bitter chocolate, licorice, nutmeg, and tingling wood spices."
3087,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Garioch) 20 year old 1994 (cask #15), 56.6%<review>An old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when Scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region, but defined by style. This is meaty with a capital M, with a rich, oily, deep character. On the palate it’s big and beautiful, with salt, oyster shell, honey, roasted green pepper, smoke, dried fruit, beef jerky, leather, and oak. Earthy peat smoke dances throughout, giving support but never stealing focus. This is about as masculine as Highland whisky gets. (U.S. only)"
3088,"<price>12<rating>75<whiskey>Canadian Mist, 40%<review>Very light in aroma and flavor. There are no off flavors. It’s just uninspiring. Delicate notes of vanilla custard, honey, caramel corn, sweet corn, and subtle fruit. Fleeting finish. "
3089,"<price>192<rating>85<whiskey>Mackmyra Moments — Drivved, 55.5%<review>Early bottlings of Mackmyra were a challenge — salty peat, intense woodiness, and unusual juniper-influenced spices made the whisky an acquired taste. Over time though, sweet fruit brought more balance and the whiskies have bloomed. This special bottling — one of four in the Moments series — recalls those roots but delivers a meaty, spicy, and earthy flavor with melt in the mouth syrup. Imagine honey poured on a heavily peppered well-done steak. €141 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
3090,"<price>45<rating>93<whiskey>Kilbeggan Single Pot Still, 43%<review>The follow up to Small Batch rye, this single pot still is double-distilled at the historic Kilbeggan Distillery with a mashbill containing 2.5% oats, inspired by a Locke family recipe from the late 1800s. Pot still spices hit the nose first, with candied peel, baked peach, apricot, creamy vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground pepper. Flavors of orange, apricot, cake, and vanilla combat fizzing pot still spices. Sublimely good Irish whiskey. Best Value"
3091,"<price>126<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Lemon Zest 1998 (distilled at Auchentoshan), 46%<review>Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past, and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles, provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches, caramel, sea salt, and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly, with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75"
3092,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>Dry, spicy, and leathery on the nose, with candied fruit and toffee. Similar on the palate, but the dryness takes a more demonstrable role, especially toward the finish -- leather, dried vanilla, warming cinnamon, and brittle mint, with some candied fruit, toffee, and molasses struggling to prop it all up. Bottom line here: this year’s offering has less of the richness, fullness, lush fruitiness, and sweetness that balanced all the dried spice and leather notes the past two years (I rated both a 94). Still a nice bourbon, but a slight setback for Eagle Rare 17 year old."
3093,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>The Irishman Cask Strength 2018, 54%<review>Irish blends come in many different combinations, but this tongue sizzler is malt and pot still whiskey only. Let the high alcohol blow off the glass to find spring blossoms, pot still spices, honey sweetness, tangerine, macadamia nut, peppercorn, star anise, and fennel seed. A rounded spiced-orange note, assertive spices, then toffee, nut, oak, and herbal tones with a finish of nippy clove and citrus peel. Dilute to taste. (3,516 bottles)"
3094,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey> Larceny Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch B520), 61.1%<review>Larceny’s barrel proof expression, released in three batches annually (January, May, and September) is a treat worth waiting for. A fragrant herbal nose offers notes of fennel, dark chocolate, peppermint, and light coconut. The palate is notably smooth, with flavors of chocolate, cooked dark fruit, black pepper, and generous spice, all underpinned by balanced oak. Water smooths it out even more, bringing out candied orange, pepper spice, and bitter chocolate."
3095,"<price>98<rating>87<whiskey>Scott Selection (distilled at Glen Grant) 1973, 26 year old, 58.2%<review>Amber chestnut color. Aromas are rich and express great depth, with highlights of ripe fruit and wood spices. Well-rounded flavors are balanced very nicely, with a gentle sweetness up front that marries well with ripe fruit, becoming dry with background wood spice notes. 
"
3096,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition, 1990 vintage, 43%<review>Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. Soft, lingering finish. 
"
3097,"<price>57<rating>78<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Strathclyde) 10 year old 2005, 50.9%<review>One might speculate about the initial qualities of this young grain prior to its sherry cask finish. While it boasts a richer color, the nose is reminiscent of roast beef, plasticine, wet dog, and bruised raspberries. In the mouth, it has good weight, though mouth puckering, with some brief rubbery notes early on before showing strawberry bubblegum, sugar crystals, black cherry, rhubarb, faint coffee notes, and an ever-growing pepperiness. An enjoyable finish of baked apple and star anise. (727 bottles) £44"
3098,"<price>132<rating>87<whiskey>Craigellachie 17 year old, 46%<review>Golden, lifted, and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83"
3099,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Chattanooga Straight Rye Malt (Batch 20I22R), 49.5%<review>

Malted rye is a rarity in whiskey, and at 60% of the mashbill here, this earns high marks for originality. The nose has lively notes of chili powder, pepper, and paprika, along with licorice, pfeffernüsse, candied dark berries, orange peel, and spearmint. The palate begins gently enough, then whips into a spice storm of chile peppers and spicy cooked meats, with flavors of roasted pecan, dark chocolate, blackberry jam, more orange peel, and rich oak, before a finish of dried oranges, vanilla syrup, and well-integrated spice. Number 18 in the 2020 Top 20"
3100,"<price>30<rating>60<whiskey>Cavalry, 45%<review>Although it’s not on the label, Cavalry uses the TerrePURE technology on 4 month old MGP whiskey. Its short time in wood shows. No traditional notes of bourbon sweetness, not even an earthy hint of wood found in many younger bourbons. This is more reminiscent of a neutral grain spirit than bourbon, but masked in the alcohol-centric flavor is a slight sweetness likely representing oak and a hint of grain. Sourced whiskey."
3101,"<price>73<rating>87<whiskey>Mackmyra Svensk Rök, 46.1%<review>Meaning Swedish smoke, and they’ve nailed the juniper smoke perfectly here. Ripening lemons, fresh cream, Turkish delight, pine forests, and barley sugar aromas. Great poise and balance. A light, lacey structure comprising creamy fudge, honey, lemon, oak, and vanilla. It just dances on the tongue. Yet billowing puffs of smoke pulse from the center. Baked lemon peel ushers in a pleasurable rolling, smoky finish. This Röks! €59"
3102,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac, 63.75%<review>Powerful, lush, and boldly spicy. A mouth-coating, invigorating rye whiskey with chewy toffee, fig cake, and candied fruit penetrated by thumping mint, warming cinnamon, and clove, ultimately revealing more subtle notes of allspice, coconut, and nutmeg. Long, delicious finish. An amazingly vibrant whiskey that lets you know you’re alive. The American whiskey equivalent of a young, cask-strength Islay single malt scotch or an imperial IPA."
3103,"<price>170<rating>90<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old, 40%<review>Not exactly a new whisky for the Jubilee, just a new pack, but it’s a good enough excuse to have a look at this top-end blend. Great maturity with masses of orchard fruits and a hint of passion fruit as well. The oak is rounded and supple while with water a banana note is released. Thick and chewy, with more grip than suggested on the nose and a little nut on the finish. Great blending. "
3104,"<price>49<rating>85<whiskey>New Southern Revival Sorghum Whiskey, 44%<review>Is it whiskey? Sorghum’s a grain, but sorghum syrup is pressed from the stalk of the plant. But HighWire Distilling uses Muddy Pond sorghum syrup, which mashes the grain in with the stalk. So…we’ll say yes, whiskey. Spritely on the tongue: lively and quick, sweet but spicy with oak, and not an off note. Crying for a cube and a shot of seltzer. Whiskey? Probably. Good? Yes!"
3105,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>The Busker Single Malt, 44.3%<review>
This is the best of the range: It carries more weight and shows greater depth than Royal Oak Distillery’s other Buskers. An enticing nose of fresh conference pear, apple peels, baking spice, nutmeg, and a hint of smoked orange peel. Its well-rounded and smooth character carries flavors of toffee, apple, sultana, and vanilla essence, broadening out with chocolate ganache, active spices, milky coffee, caramel, and rich fruit. Best Value"
3106,"<price>37<rating>83<whiskey>Union Horse Distilling Reserve Straight Bourbon (Batch 1), 46%<review>Aged up to 5 years, this whiskey serves up lots of fresh, oaky sawdust with its caramel and toffee, along with some varnish notes. Aromas of spice and smoke lead to a palate of butterscotch, smooth and oily in texture, with robust, warming spice and a dry, leathery, and tannic finish. Nice maturity and polish for the price."
3107,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Mackmyra, First Edition, 46.1%<review>The first ""big"" release from this Swedish distillery.  I'm very impressed.  It's youthful, but not immature.  Very intriguing, too.  Bright notes of ripe orchard fruit and soothing vanilla cream on the nose and palate, along with more subtle bramble, silky honey, and caramel, toasted coconut, marshmallow, bread dough, and grist.  Teasing smoke emerges occasionally, adding to this whisky's delightful nature.  Clean, toasted oak finish.  I particularly enjoy the complex interplay between the fruit and sweetness.  A fun whisky with a playful personality.  More, please!  "
3108,"<price>400<rating>94<whiskey>Redemption 18 year old Straight Rye, 54.95%<review>This sings a tune of balance, with caramel, coconut, chocolate, barrel char, and campfire smoke harmonizing at the opening. Next comes an amazingly complex series of herbal notes: dill, oregano, and thyme. That’s when cinnamon bread, coffee, and crème brûlée take over; each note super concentrated and rounded. The long finish presents a hint of cinnamon. This is a must-have sipper. (450 bottles)"
3109,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Thunder Bolt 100 Proof, 50%<review>The trend to higher-proof Canadian whisky continues. This massive gem from Highwood shows us how that benefits the whisky drinker. Toffee and spicy rye on the nose become toffee and sizzling hot pepper on the palate. While toffee lurks in the shadows, a lingering oaky base begins to assert itself. Sweetness and pepper subside as the wood emerges with a complexity not even hinted at on the nose. Enjoy it neat; love it with ginger ale. (Canada only) "
3110,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>McKenzie Rye, 45.5%<review>From Finger Lakes distilling; one of two craft ryes I’m revisiting this issue. An interesting aroma of dry hay, dried fruit, and burlap that’s appealing to anyone who’s spent time on a farm. Smooth but not laid-back on the tongue, there’s plenty of good stuff going on here. Peppery rye, some soft fruit, that fresh burlap, and an urgent but not unwelcome heat. Maybe a little overdone on the fruit, but well-done overall."
3111,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Fukano Vault Reserve #1, 40.5%<review>Herbal with roasted sage leaves, coriander seed, savory meat juices, and a twinge of tarragon, though there are fruity qualities like fresh peach and clementine. Creamy orange fondant, clove, peach, and nectarine sweetness, honey, and caramel with a gentle spicy edge makes for a quite charming whisky. It reaches a plateau relatively quickly, with just hints of citrus fruit and light spices to finish. (5,443 bottles)"
3112,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box The Lost Blend, 46%<review>The smoking wicks of church candles, smoked meat, coastal notes, cumin, coriander seed, and herbal elements. A sophisticated palate of unsweetened fruit. Peaches, citrus, and pineapple, with a waxy presence building later on, settles to a dry finish of herbs and beeswax. We can easily overlook the narcissism of making tributes to your own past bottlings as John Glaser turns whisky resurrectionist in homage to Eleuthera. Layered, complex, thought provoking, and finely tuned for the connoisseur."
3113,"<price>37<rating>86<whiskey>Pinhook Rye Humor Straight Rye, 48.5%<review>Herbal and medicinal aromas—eucalyptus, menthol, licorice, Pine-Sol—intertwine with kiwi, green banana, and blackberries on the nose. It remains consistent on the palate, with mint, bay leaf, eucalyptus, Szechuan peppercorn, licorice, dark berries, and dry oak; with water, lemon oil and hints of tropical fruit emerge. The finish is oak-driven and peppery, with the sweet medicinal quality of cherry cough syrup."
3114,"<price>119<rating>78<whiskey>The Maltman (distilled at Linkwood) 18 year old Port Finish, 46%<review>Light onionskin color; the nose is scented with red fruits, cranberry sauce, hawthorn jelly, and red apple. With water there’s some bletted medlars mixed with lemon. Sadly, the palate is soapy to start with, before the super-ripe red fruits come through. Water makes things fresher, but overall it lacks personality."
3115,"<price>120<rating>86<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 23 year old, 45.3%<review>Caramel and cigar box lead the way, but leather comes in strong, followed by oak, earth, and mushrooms. On the palate, Nutella and roasted almonds resonate over crème brûlée, salt water taffy, vanilla icing, and nutmeg, with slight hints of apple and pineapple, at which point I think it really starts to pick up and take on some complexity. Alas, the short finish hurts what was a delightful experience."
3116,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glentauchers), 14 year old, 43%<review>Fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. Creamy on the nose and palate. Nicely malty, too, with interwoven notes of vanilla, caramel custard, and hazelnut, offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. A calming whisky best enjoyed after a very stressful day.

3117,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>The Clover 4 year old Single Barrel Straight Bourbon (No. E-010), 46%<review>A new brand honoring golf legend Bobby Jones and offering three expressions—a rye, a 10 year old Tennessee whiskey, and this single-barrel bourbon. The bourbon has a nose of mint, red berries, blueberries, orange slices, and pine forest. The palate is smoothly textured and full bodied, with generous notes of vanilla, spice, cedar, and pepper. The finish is somewhat oak-heavy, but with good texture and pleasant fruit notes. Solid and well balanced. (24,000 bottles)"
3118,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>Glendalough 13 year old Mizunara Finish, 46%<review>Ripe pit fruit, especially apricot and peach, Quaker oats, and comb honey aromas are boosted by aromatic fragrances and sandalwood. Cantaloupe, mango, and papaya are followed by chocolate and cocoa, which pair beautifully with the muted citrus. Fragrant spices really add shape and contribute to a sublime balance, with spicy chocolate, coffee grounds, and menthol to finish. A most impressive leap forward in quality and complexity. (6,000 bottles for U.S.)"
3119,"<price>55<rating>91<whiskey>Glenmorangie 14 year old Quinta Ruban, 46%<review>Orange segments sprinkled with black pepper on the nose, then spicy dark chocolate and coffee with cream. More dark chocolate and Jaffa orange on the palate, plus walnuts, almonds, and marzipan. Lengthy in the finish, with soft spices and continuing dark chocolate."
3120,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Old Elk Wheated Straight Bourbon, 46%<review>The nose is light, sweet, and mildly chalky, like talcum powder or freshly whipped meringue; it also has pistachio pudding and hints of flavored tobacco. On the palate, embers burn gently beneath apple, almond, and milk chocolate, with a pleasantly silky mouthfeel. The medium-length finish rounds things out with smoked vanilla sugar, dark-roast coffee, and bittersweet oak. This has plenty of personality, but a light touch."
3121,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>The Tyrconnell 10 year old Port Cask Finish, 46%<review>Comparatively speaking, the aromas of red apple, peppercorn, baked ham, and rowanberry make it the least enticing nose in the Tyrconnell range, although the port cask endows a beautiful delicate blush to the whiskey’s color. The mouthfeel is thinner too, with red apple, watermelon, mouth-drawing oak, fruit chews, and burnt spices in the end. A redeeming finish, however, the gums tingling delightfully with fruit and spice."
3122,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Old Forester 1910 Old Fine Whisky, 46.5%<review>A nose of cherry candies, rose water, spiced molasses cookie, candied nuts, clove, and nutmeg make a lovely first impression. On the palate it feels a bit soft, with butter pecan ice cream, banana, and toffee, as it strikes a balance of sweetness and spice. The finish veers toward earthiness, with tobacco barn and warming chili spice."
3123,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Balcones Texas Cask Strength Straight Rye (Batch RCS19-1), 63.3%<review>The nose has coffee beans, dark chocolate, green pepper, jalapeño, blueberry, and bonfire—like an amaro that’s trying to pick a fight. On the palate, it’s sweet, savory, spicy, and smoky: Mexican chocolate, grilled pineapple and corn, smoked nuts, coffee ice cream, chipotle, and barrel char. The mouthwatering finish continues the theme, with mole sauce, coffee bean, dark chocolate, roasted pecans, and smoked almonds. There are a lot of layers here—you’re going to want to spend time exploring them."
3124,"<price>22<rating>78<whiskey>Highwood True North, 40%<review>A simple, straightforward session whisky. True North is rich in the classic caramel notes and searing pepper so coveted by shooters and tailgaters. Ginger and white pepper last seemingly forever. Given its undeniable drinkability, packaging in a plastic bottle is probably a good idea. You can sip this if you wish, but with ginger ale and a dash of bitters it becomes a Canadian Saturday night in a glass. A classic Canadian bottom-shelfer. (Canada only)"
3125,"<price>92<rating>84<whiskey>Whisky Castle Vintage (Cask 485), 43%<review>Ruedi Käser has made Whisky Castle one of the best-known Swiss whiskies, and he actively experiments with different grains and cask types. This single-cask expression was produced from corn and 20% peated malt. Herbal notes, fruit jelly on toast, dry oak, cinnamon, warm toasty spices, and a little smoke. A nice silky texture; red fruits, apple, plum, ground ginger, and peppercorn. Pleasant sweetness to begin, then a growing bitterness decaying to a dry and spicy finish. CHF89"
3126,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Arran 18 year old, 46%<review>Following the 2015 limited edition release of 18 year old Arran single malt, an 18 year old has now been added to the core range. It is uncolored and non-chill filtered. The nose is bright with freshly-squeezed orange and lemon juices, honey, and vanilla fudge, plus a fleeting menthol note. The early palate mirrors the fresh fruit-laden nose, with developing ginger, honey, malt, and milk chocolate. Slowly drying in the finish, with plain chocolate, licorice, and charred oak."
3127,"<price>125<rating>84<whiskey>Benromach 25 year old, 43%<review>The oldest of the group, and it shows. When compared to younger expressions, there’s less peaches and more citrus (lemon, tangerine). It is thicker on the palate-with notes of fat barley and crème brulee-before dry, resinous oak notes intensify. Dry, spicy finish. Not as even-keeled as younger expressions, but quite dynamic."
3128,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Old Forester 150th Anniversary Batch Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch 02/03), 63.2%<review>

The most muscular whiskeys can sometimes feel like bullies, attempting to subdue your palate, but this one shows its strength without aggression. Deeply sweet and nutty on the nose, with pralines, butterscotch, and maple syrup, along with candied orange peel and cherry juice. The palate has a strong backbone of spice—ginger, chiles, and black pepper—while generous oak fills out the frame, and over all of it, dark fruit flavors drip: boysenberry syrup, cherry juice, and blackberry jam. The lengthy finish sprinkles a bit of tobacco and a generous amount of cocoa powder."
3129,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Spirit Works Bottled in Bond Straight Rye, 50%<review>Rye at its prettiest and most delicate: bouquets of flowers, with boxed pistachio pudding, Apple Jacks, honey cough drops, licorice, and anise on the nose. Though it shows plenty of barrel influence, the palate is more spirit-driven and provocative, with peonies, lilacs, rose petals, pistachios, and nougat, lengthened by cocoa powder on the finish."
3130,"<price>2000<rating>93<whiskey>Dailuaine 1980 34 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 50.9%<review>That rarely-spotted beast Dailuaine gets the Special Release treatment. This example has come from refill American oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery’s fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. In time there are fat fruits, Victoria plum, bitter citrus, faded green leafiness, and chocolate notes. The palate is ripe, rich, and profound, with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. Long, elegant, and complex, this is the best of this year’s bunch for me."
3131,"<price>80<rating>78<whiskey>Raasay While We Wait, 46%<review>This bottling from an unspecified Highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the Raasay distillery, currently under construction.  Peated to a level of 15ppm, this expression has been finished in Tuscan red wine casks.  4,000 bottles are available. Buttery farmyard aromas, with red berries and a sense of relative youth.  Silky on the palate, with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat. Pepper and peat in a medium-length finish. £55"
3132,"<price>44<rating>89<whiskey>Teeling Small Batch, 46%<review>The first conventional release from this fledgling company. Irish whiskey's equivalent to a seemingly frothy sweet pop song, which on closer inspection has barbed and cutting lyrics. It's a sweet Irish blend and seems like it. But it has a high malt content, is packed with flavor, and it easily justifies its price. It's creamy and rich with toffee notes, there's some tropical fruit and delicious rum-and-raisin milk chocolate. Not too cloying despite the sweetness, either. "
3133,"<price>85<rating>86<whiskey>The BenRiach Importanticus 12 year old, 46%<review>Finished in a tawny port cask. Peat smoke and seaweed interwoven with layers of ripe, red fruit (currant, raspberry, cherry), crisp citrus, graham cracker, vanilla, and honey. Nice interplay between sweetness, fruit, and smoke. (Brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.)"
3134,"<price>28<rating>85<whiskey>Stillhouse Red Hot Moonshine, 34.5%<review>True to its name, the nose is exactly Red Hots candy along with a touch of corn underneath. The entry is soft cinnamon, but it quickly ramps up to fiery Red Hots candy. The proofing here matches the flavor precisely, for a pleasantly spicy but not overly fiery mid-palate. The finish is short and cleans up well with light lingering cinnamon left behind. A good balance of sweet and spicy, and a solid offering for the genre."

The nose has honey and melon, but it’s drenched in the sweet wine notes. The palate mingles the melon and honey flavors with sugared sultana until the sweetness abates, bringing out more fruit skins, then a surprising spearmint note on the finish. CHF79"
3136,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Tyrconnell 16 year old, 46%<review>Whiskeys made from 100% Irish barley are not abundant, so at sweet sixteen, there is much to celebrate about this grown-up version of Tyrconnell. Honey, pear, crème brûlée, clementine peel, tinned peach, and pencil shavings on the nose. Citrus, candied peel, lemon, and grapefruit mingle among the sweetness, but it’s anchored by layered spices and rounds out with a finish of juicy spiced oranges and peach. Moreish and delicious."
3137,"<price>77<rating>88<whiskey>Lagavulin Distillers Edition 1995, 43%<review>It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed, even PX casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s Syrah-like sootiness, and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’"
3138,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Prichard’s Sweet Lucy, 35%<review>A sweet mélange of bourbon, honey, ladyfingers, and praline in the nose, with a faint thread of heavy tree blossoms. Quite sweet, but not syrupy, and the aromas — minus the blossoms — are here, plus vanilla. Some stickiness on the finish, but it’s not unpleasant, more like candy, which is what this experience is like: booze candy. That candy simplicity is confusing: there are a lot of flavors here, but at a candy level. A bit less sweetness would be welcome."
3139,"<price>16<rating>87<whiskey>Jamie Stewart, 40%<review>An entrancing nose shows ripe apples and peaches, blueberry pie, earthy and saline peat, and fresh citrus. Although light, the palate has an enjoyable fruity character with layers of grapefruit, candy apple, kettle corn, wild berry, and orange Creamsicle. Water does not benefit this—drink it as-is. Aged at least 5 years. (Total Wine & More)"
3140,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel-Finished Sour Mash American Whiskey (Batch 19G1244), 43%<review>This limited release is aged in new charred oak, like Michter’s bourbons and ryes, but finished in uncharred barrels with a milder toast profile. Made from a mashbill that doesn’t qualify it as bourbon or rye, it has a nose of perfumed oak, candle wax, iced tea, orange blossom, and wild strawberries. A silky palate of licorice, spice, raisins, and dark fruits is followed by a finish of apple, pear, honey, chocolate, and oak."
3141,"<price>400<rating>92<whiskey>Balvenie Tun 1509 Batch 5, 52.6%<review>A mix of 29 bourbon and sherry casks that were mingled for 3 months in Balvenie’s bespoke marrying vessel, the Tun. Fragrant oriental spices on the nose: ginger, cinnamon, fresh orange juice, and brittle toffee. Full and smooth on the palate, with sweet sherry and spicy Jaffa orange. Long in the finish, with dark chocolate, oak tannins, raisins, and licorice at the close."
3142,"<price>567<rating>83<whiskey>The Macallan Coronation (American Oak Cask #190950), 58.1%<review>Bottled at 350ml. as a pair with a Spanish oak version (and probably sold out at source), here you get the merest glimpse of Macallan’s meatiness (shepherd’s pie) before flowers and apple blossom take charge. Lifted, yes, but never delicate. Water brings out cereal and mealy pudding, with barley sugar on the end. £350"
3143,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Three Chord Amplify Rye (Batch 0015), 47.5%<review>Piney and grassy on the nose, with fruity aromas of grape Kool-Aid, bubble gum, and grapefruit, as well as new wood. The palate picks up the herbal and pine notes, adding licorice and spearmint, as well as honey, orange, blueberry, grape, and grapefruit oil, with Popsicle stick throughout. Lingering mint, banana bread, citrus oil, and green wood on the finish. (8,400 bottles)"
3144,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Bushmills Bourbon Cask #8141, 56.5%<review>This is what the standard Bushmills Malt 10 year old should taste like. A classic Irish whiskey nose. Deliciously sweet creamy notes of vanilla, marshmallow, honey, powdered sugar, and polished oak. Faint tropical fruit notes emerge from time to time. Very clean on the palate, with a dry, bourbon-like finish. Those extra few years in wood, along with being non-chill-filtered, add richness, depth, and complexity."
3145,"<price>56<rating>88<whiskey>Whiskey Del Bac Dorado, 45%<review>Mesquite-smoked single malt from Arizona. Very rich and aromatic, dripping with barbecue sauce, paprika, juicy red apple, and smoked bacon on the nose. A full panoply of barbecue flavors on the palate—brisket, roast chicken, ribs. Cayenne, walnuts, and spiced ginger balanced with oranges, apples, and pears. Some tar and creosote notes. Juicy, meaty, and smoky all at the same time. The herbal, vegetative notes are intriguing, but can be divisive."
3146,"<price>25<rating>89<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1994 Vintage (Barrel #1), 43.3% ABV<review>This is an elegant whiskey with lots of finesse. Its primary flavors are vanilla, mint, and candied fruit. A touch of honey, light toffee, slight nuttiness, and rum notes round out the palate. Very clean, with a pleasingly dry finish. And nicely rounded too! Each year’s vintage is slightly different. Some have been quite rich and full in texture. This one is more subtle and teasing-and it’s one of the better ones."
3147,"<price>599<rating>88<whiskey>The Balvenie Single Barrel Traditional Oak 25 year old, 47.8%<review>Light gold, with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery, as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. The wood influence appears minimal to start with, but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. Opens into clementine peel, pomelo, then cooked dessert apple. The palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. Remarkably assertive for a 25 year old."
3148,"<price>67<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Scotia 12 year old, 46%<review>Nougat and a suggestion of fresh newsprint on the nose. Quite full-bodied, with a palate of mixed nuts and peaches in brandy. The finish is slightly waxy, with fruit and nut chocolate. "
3149,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 1994 Master Distiller’s Private Selection, 40%<review>Close to one year later than the previous Knappogue Castle release, a 15 year old expression, and distinctly different in flavor profile. (Think different distilleries.) This one, triple-distilled, suggests Bushmills origin. Very clean and polished. Gently sweet, too, with powdered vanilla, honeyed malt, complex tropical fruit (tangerine, kiwi, coconut, pineapple), and creamy marshmallow. Clean, gently sweet finish. Not the most complex Irish I’ve ever tasted, but the flavors that are there are tight and well-balanced."
3150,"<price>700<rating>83<whiskey>Kirkland Signature (distilled at Glenlivet) 40 year old, 40%<review>Bottling of a large package of 12 butts and 30 hoggies dating from 1972. The nose is slightly closed initially, but shows good mature distillery character: old apple, potpourri, more raspberry, and furniture polish. The palate is a little dry, with humidor and light chocolate, but needs water to bring out the fruit-sugar sweetness. It’s good, but that low bottling strength has sapped it of the energy which is vital for old whiskies. (U.S. only) "
3151,"<price>170<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich 20 year old (3rd Edition), 46%<review>Finished in Madeira casks. An interesting contrast to the 15 year old. This one is more challenging than soothing (and quite dry too -- especially on the palate), with dominant red fruit (currant, raspberry, strawberry), plum, baked cinnamon apple, polished leather, bourbon, almonds, and just the hint of smoke and brine. Dry, resinous finish. An intense Laddie."
3152,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Rye French Oak Finish (Barrel F2-038), 45%<review>Fruity with dried dates and figs, peaches, peach pits, purple plum pits, and hints of black licorice. Tingling cloves and ginger add zip to traces of bitter chewing tobacco. Powerful, firm, and drying with pulling tannins like a fine Bordeaux. While this is gorgeous whisky in its own right, the French oak flavors have overwhelmed the familiar clean, spicy, fruity base of the original Masterson’s on which it was built. (U.S. only)"
3153,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Masterson’s Straight Rye, 45%<review>A seamless fusion of rain-moistened earth, gunnysacks, and searing white pepper underpins the delicately bitter grain-like notes of fresh-baked rye bread. Lilacs and violets speak of rye grain, as do delicate cloves and tingling ginger, while dark stewed fruits attest to age. A mingling of hand-selected barrels of 10 year old all rye whisky, Masterson’s is redolent of vintage car leather and kiln-dried burley tobacco, with touches of dry herbs and spearmint. Sweet vanilla envelops early butterscotch."
3154,"<price>140<rating>90<whiskey>Hirsch Rye, 21 year old, 46.5%<review>(Previously reviewed in Vol. 15, No. 3.) Similar to the other two rye whiskeys reviewed above, with less heat on the finish and slightly more minty spice notes. 
"
3155,"<price>185<rating>79<whiskey>Highland Park 24 year old 1980 vintage, 58%<review>This whisky is not as good as the similarly-aged, more polished and refined, standard distillery-bottled 25 year old cask-strength expression (our ""Whisky of the Year"" several years ago). This single cask bottling from a sherry cask is intensely sherried. Sappy fruit notes dominate the palate. Damp, somewhat tired, oak notes are prevalent throughout. The whisky is also nutty, with heathery peat notes emerging occasionally. The floral, heather-honeyed grace treasured in Highland Park struggles to emerge, and ultimately loses the battle. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
3156,"<price>81<rating>84<whiskey>Wolfburn The Kylver Series, 46%<review>Matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. Ultimately, mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. Once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65"
3157,"<price>319<rating>89<whiskey>Overeem Sherry Matured Cask Strength, 60%<review>First of two bottlings. The Old Hobart distillery used 100-liter sherry French oak quarter casks to create this beauty. Hediard fruit jellies (blackcurrant, quince, and mango), nutmeg, cassia, hot sand, and caramelized biscuits. The sherry gives a willowy soft opener, with tobacco, bitter plums, and Earl Grey tea bleeding out to dark toffees, espresso, and a Flemish biscuit note. Water produces a cappuccino finish. For the alcohol content, the pair are similarly priced, but this one offers greater rewards. £189"
3158,"<price>130<rating>90<whiskey>Knob Creek 25th Anniversary Single Barrel (barreled 2/11/2004), 60.9%<review>When the caramel train comes, it rarely returns after such strong earthy notes of roots, hay, and soil. It’s the same story in the next round: first, pan-fried sweet potatoes and parsnips dominate; caramel returns with vanilla, allspice, and white pepper. Then the odd but welcomed combo of campfire-smoked marshmallows and gingersnaps just before a long caramel finish. Very unique."
3159,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Barrell Bourbon (Batch 004), 58.4%<review>A nose like Big Red gum—juicy-sweet cinnamon—and some sweet dough, with sharp alcohol heat. Hot as expected on the tongue, but exciting: more cinnamon and sweetness—like snickerdoodles—with wet corn, a touch of bitter oil, and hot spearmint. Adding water eases the heat, and brings out the oak. Good stuff, if a bit simple. Sourced whiskey."
3160,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Oban, Distiller's Edition, 1992 vintage, 43%<review>Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage."
3161,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Old Forester The President’s Choice (Barrel No. 1), 55.5%<review>Lovely concentration of flavors, including whiffs of vanilla cream soda, clover honey, bananas Foster, and a dash of pepper define this selection of barrels by Old Forester president Campbell Brown. Zippy and bright, with lemony verve, peach puree, and warming ginger. The finish smacks of pecan, bitter citrus oil, and peppery spice, with the exquisite oak content in a supporting role. (Available at Old Forester Distillery)"
3162,"<price>30<rating>84<whiskey>Ezra B 15 year old Barrel #10, 49.5%<review>Amber-walnut color. Deep, mature aromas of wood spices, mint, molasses, and dark, candied fruit. Thick and mouth coating. Flavors of molasses, mint, leather, dark fruit, leading to a very long, very dry wood and spice finish. The oldest of the Ezra Brooks line, and a very mature expression. Some might find this whiskey a little too woody and dry. Otherwise, there's plenty of character and complexity to entertain the palate."
3163,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>Peerless (distilled at Glen Grant) 1970, 46.1%<review>Mahogany color. Full-bodied, thick and chewy. Incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee, fudge, spice cake, ripe fruit, burnished leather, and oak. Nicely balanced throughout, with a long, satisfying finish. 
"
3164,"<price>126<rating>82<whiskey>Old Particular (distilled at Cambus) 27 year old, 51.5%<review>Oh boy! It’s like tearing open a warm banana-and-toffee muffin, the steam bringing the moist, sweet goodness to your nostrils. Roasted peach and neat orange cordial join the party. On the palate, the alcohol strength is noticeably strong, with flavors of red currant, cranberry, and black pepper. At the fruitier end of the Cambus spectrum, this concludes with a whimper of spices, leading to a nip of cinnamon and bitter vanilla in the tail. (270 bottles) £87"
3165,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Catskill Defiant Rye, 42.5%<review>All four of these Catskill whiskeys are in exceptionally beautiful bottles. Pleasant, homey smell of furniture polish, dried mint and grass, golden syrup, and sweet dough, wrapped in a thin layer of oak. Brightly sweet, more mint and grass, some cashew richness, and an insistent singing thread of oak that broadens to the finish, where the sweet and the oak balance with a new note of melon. A bit of astringency at the end, but this is right decent whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
3166,"<price>75<rating>80<whiskey>Royal Lochnagar Distillers Edition 1998, 40%<review>One of the newest of the Distillers Edition family. Here, Royal Lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in Muscat casks. That nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world; think blueberry muffin and boysenberry jam. The slight sour/bitter note is a positive, but I think in this case that the finish dominates proceedings and needs to be scaled down a little. £48"
3167,"<price>297<rating>88<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 40 year old 1975, 57.7%<review>This potent grain whisky from a refill hoggie bears ripe pears, green apples, vanilla sugar, polished horse chestnuts, and a waft of acetone. Neat, there is sweet fudge, runny caramels, and heat, but natural dilution dissipates the sweetness to boiled candy with faint cocoa. At this strength, it really takes water generously, illuminating fruitiness and softening the heat. Dry, sweet vanilla pricked with orange seals the finish. There’s a sweet spot where this is deliciously drinkable. (114 bottles) £190"
3168,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Woodinville Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Black pepper and toasted oak on the nose mingle with deeper aromas of blackcurrant and strawberry preserves. The palate is smooth, showing flavors of vanilla bean, coconut, peppermint, and cinnamon. Dark chocolate emerges on the back palate, along with pepper and tobacco leaf. The finish is long, revealing maple syrup, caramel, and brown sugar. Five years of aging have created a solid, well-constructed bourbon that has impressive depth and complexity."
3169,"<price>3700<rating>89<whiskey>Port Ellen 1983 32 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 53.9%<review>Matured in refill European oak sherry butts, this year’s Special Release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter, burning paper, fire grate, and wood smoke. The more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. All very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. Excellent, but, ouch, that price!"
3170,"<price>73<rating>82<whiskey>Strathclyde 12 year old, 62.1%<review>An official Strathclyde from Chivas Bros., presented in its squat bottle from their under-appreciated Cask Strength Edition series. I found a peculiar nose comprising shafts of lemongrass, garlic bulb, root ginger, taffy candy, and green tea. As an Iron Dram, it’s oily and bold, with coconut, fresh mint, and green pea, with a savory note tugging at the taste buds. Dilution highlights scallions, a light creamy toffee, and Reese’s peanut butter cups. Curiously intriguing: for bold flavor explorers only. £43"
3171,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>Teeling The Gathering 11 year old, 46%<review>Cooley produced some great Irish single malt whiskeys and this is no slouch, either. It pulls off the trick of being both very Irish, with sweet, lush pear, fermenting apple, and yellow fruit notes; and of being distinctively a single malt, mainly because the barley is held in check by just enough influence of tannin and spice. It's a bit like a fruit cordial, and the oak doesn't overstay its welcome. A nice pepper flourish in the finish."
3172,"<price>27<rating>79<whiskey>Tomatin,12 year old, 43%<review>Enjoyable creamy texture and medium-bodied. Gently sweet notes of light toffee and vanilla custard, especially towards the front of the palate. Nutty too, with some sultana in the background. Gentle oak notes towards the finish. A very clean, well-balanced whisky that’s very easy to drink but also takes few risks. 
"
3173,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Redwood Empire Pipe Dream Bourbon, 45%<review>A blend of 4 to 12 year old bourbons, including some made at Sonoma County’s Graton Distilling Co., along with bourbons from Kentucky, Indiana, and Tennessee. Named after Pipe Dream, a giant redwood near the distillery. An herbaceous nose offers spearmint, spice, tea, and leather. Coconut on the palate, followed by orange oil, peach pie, vanilla, brown sugar, and chocolate-covered almonds. The finish has spice, nutty dark chocolate, espresso, and melon. Cohesive, balanced, and well-textured."
3174,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Label 5 Extra Premium 12 year old, 40%<review>This is bursting with barley, sweet oak, and all-butter shortbread. There are charcoal sticks too, which add a cool smoke note. The taste is like a warm hug on a cold morning; flavors of butter toffee, orange, poached pear, and ginger snaps, which combine to keep that deep smoke in balance. The harmony continues into the lengthy finish with flavors of citrus, melon, and ground ginger."
3175,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>St. George Single Malt (Lot 17), 43%<review>Exhibits the floral, rose petal, and fresh meadow character often found in St. George malts. The palate pours with white peach and apricot, coupled with warm cereal notes. A delicate whiskey that might have benefited from higher proof, but remains enjoyable for its lingering sweetness, elegant character, and unmistakable craftsmanship."
3176,"<price>170<rating>88<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Bourbon Batch No. 1, 59.2%<review>Good nose: fresh-ground corn, warm oak, and light cinnamon. Impressively friendly even at full proof: corn pudding, sun-warmed oak plank, rich and nuanced cinnamon spice, a powerful engine running strong. A splash of water brings out some sweet berries, revs up the oak and pulls out more spice, and opens up the finish into a full-throated roar of oak, corn, and sweet citrus. This is what happens when you let a good barrel run at full throttle. Sourced whiskey. (Kentucky only)"
3177,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic, 40%<review>This offers an enticing nose of honey, malt, and barley sugar—sweet and floral. Peaches in cream on the palate, a suggestion of madeira, milk chocolate, and Brazil nuts. Cocoa, citrus fruits, and light oak in the medium-length finish. Value pick"
3178,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Arran Sherry Premium Single Cask 1997 #217, 53.2%<review>This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17th, 1997, being bottled on February 5th, 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar, followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied, with spicy sherry, figs, and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish, with fruity sherry to the end. (U.S. only)"
3179,"<price>125<rating>83<whiskey>Hanyu 6 of Hearts 1991, 57.9%<review>Finished off in a 500-liter American oak puncheon, this has typical Hanyu robustness with a burnt edge hinting at roasted corn. A little touch of fresh varnish and wax polish adds a savory air before fruits come through: strawberry, sloe, and plum. The palate is, to this mouth, very, very hot. Water reveals more dense fruit, and on the palate there’s plenty of toasted oak, stewed rhubarb, and dry-roasted peanuts on the finish. A very solid example.¥12,000"
3180,"<price>170<rating>88<whiskey>Chieftain’s Choice (distilled at Rosebank) 20 year old, 54%<review>This refill sherry butt-matured, cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose. Sweet, with malt and black cherries, plus a hint of new leather. Quite viscous in the mouth; nutmeg, dark chocolate, and toffee on the palate. Walnuts and background dry sherry. The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice."
3181,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney Navigator, 46%<review>Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla, sherry, American cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. Dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. Value Pick."
3182,"<price>67<rating>85<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Torfa, 40%<review>Torfa is apparently Old Norse for “turf” or “peat,” and this no age statement Glenglassaugh was made using malt peated to around 20 ppm phenols. Heathery peatiness on the early nose, with dried fruits, malt, and cream soda. Ultimately, leathery, mellow smoke. Sweet and lively on the palate, after an initial flavor of coal soot, with ripe peaches, chili, and ginger, backed by floral peat and a hint of ozone. Spicy peat smoke in the relatively long and fruity finish. £40"
3183,"<price>350<rating>95<whiskey>Old Rip Van Winkle <review>Distilled in 1986. An excellent old wheated bourbon. Soothing oily texture, with notes of toffee, old rum, nougat, vanilla bean, candied fruit, black raspberry, corn bread, hints of Earl Grey tea, cinnamon, and nutmeg, with a smooth, polished oak finish. I recently reviewed a Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve 23 year old (bottle #B1986) at 47.8%, which I also thought was outstanding, with a comparable flavor profile (although some earlier bottlings I tasted years ago were heavy on the oak), and it was priced at $220. Given this, you need to ask yourself if you want to pay the extra $130 or so for the higher strength, special decanter, pair of glasses, and wood box that comes with this new ORVW Family Selection. Or not."
3184,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Auchentoshan Virgin Oak, 46%<review>Morrison Bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its Auchentoshan single malt, which has no age statement. The North American oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this Lowland whisky as their first fillings. The result is a nose of Madeira, cinnamon, vanilla, and white pepper. Very spicy on the palate, with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. Lingering in the finish, with cocoa powder, icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time."
3185,"<price>549<rating>89<whiskey>Oban 21 year old, 57.9%<review>Rather than the customary bourbon cask, this was aged in refill European oak butts. The nose is delicate, with brittle toffee, vibrant orange, pineapple, and a hint of barley. Mellow and fruity on the palate, with apricots, soft toffee, and table salt. Gingery oak and cocoa in the lengthy, slightly minty finish."
3186,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>Laphroaig Triple Wood, 48%<review>This is the first time I’ve been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool, mark tightly, let everyone know I’m hard to please. Then they gave me this, the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite, but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. Laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. It’s essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It’s an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this. Big, moody, broody, fruity, and rich: what’s not to love? (Travel Retail and some European specialist retailers)"
3187,"<price>43<rating>76<whiskey>Santis Edition Santis, 40%<review>The least exciting or distinctive of the Santis range and in some ways the most Germanic and European, with a soft, sweet, and rounded taste that, depending on your point of view, is either flabby and ill-defined, or delightfully soft and cushion-like; the whisky equivalent of eating a milk chocolate bar with a honeycomb center.  €32"
3188,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>J.J. Corry The Hanson, 46%<review>Clean, pure, clinical aromas of a boutique, with light lemon fondant, vanilla, and basil leaves. Icing sugar, lemon, almonds, and sweet rose-scented Turkish delight flavors develop into butterscotch, peppercorn, ginger, fudge, and banana, rounded off with ripe fruits, melted butter, dried apple, sherbet, raspberry taffy, and raspberry bubble gum. Named after the exciseman that proposed to J.J. Corry’s daughter, this whiskey has plenty of stories to tell."
3189,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Abraham Bowman Port Finished Bourbon 12 year old, 50%<review>Quite lush—the port influence is clearly obvious and adds a degree of opulence to this bourbon. Notes of ripe cherry dipped in caramel, then light molasses, blend in with more traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and spice. A pleasant diversion from the bourbon norm, and ideal for postprandial consumption. (It begs for a fine cigar, for those inclined.)"
3190,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Co. Cider Cask Finished Virginia-Highland (Batch #2), 46%<review>Malty and biscuity aromas mingle seamlessly with vanilla, plums, raisins, and chocolate-covered bananas. The Highland scotch in the blend asserts itself with dry graininess and a floral character bordering on potpourri, but is well-balanced with cooked plum and pear, chocolate, ginger, and Fig Newton. Nuttiness and a bit of ash round out a pleasantly bitter-sweet finish that shows impressive length."
3191,"<price>34<rating>78<whiskey>Wigle Whim Hint of Hop, 46%<review>Like the Whim Mocha Porter, this is certified organic; a wheat whiskey made with locally-grown hops. Hard to tease out hops vs. small barrel oak spice in the nose; it’s bold and shouty. Wow. The hops are explosive in the mouth, flashing bitter on the tongue. The first sip was shocking, now it’s settling in, and becoming smoother, but I just don’t think this much hops is a good idea in a whiskey. Price is per 375 ml."
3192,"<price>129<rating>77<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990, 51.5%<review>Squished rosehip, nuttiness, and seasoned wood, but there is little else of note on this one. The palate has corn sweetness, red fruits, pomegranate, cherry lips, and descends into soor ploom territory with more oak wood. The finish continues the woody theme with a residual baked apple note.  Port Dundas can be wonderful to drink, but with no shortage of good to great grain whisky on the market, I feel this one is past its best. (258 bottles) £90"
3193,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), 14 year old, 1991 vintage, 46%<review>Finished in cognac wood. The cognac wood influence might dominate other whiskies, but the Coal Ila is big enough for challenge. If anything, it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding, bare-knuckled whisky;. It works nicely. Notes of germinating barley, vanilla cream, grape preserve, and peat bonfire, with a salty, smoky finish. (Available in the Chicago area.)

3194,"<price>126<rating>88<whiskey>Master of Malt Darkness! Clynelish 16 year old Oloroso Cask Finish, 54.9%<review>Darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill oloroso or Pedro Ximénez casks. Waxy on the nose, with dates, prunes, cherries, cocoa powder, window polish, and finally vanilla. Warm and spicy on the palate, with sweet sherry, hot chocolate, intense tropical fruit notes, and cloves. The fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty, with clove oil. £75"
3195,"<price>60<rating>80<whiskey>Pebble Beach, 12 year old, 43%<review>Identified on the label only as a single malt Speyside whisky, but does not disclose the distillery. A rounded, gently sweet whisky -- nothing too assertive here to offend anyone, and unpretentious -- with notes of vanilla, toasted coconut, caramel apple, honeydew melon, and ripe berries. Creamy finish."
3196,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon, 50%<review>Generously oaked, with toasty oak drive delivering brown spices and earthy dried apple on the nose. The palate pours sweet and rich, with warm corn porridge underscored with dark molasses and maple flavors. There is a lot to like here, from the boiled peanuts to a spiced palate, as the young, house-made whiskey imparts its verve to the 9 year old Indiana bourbon."
3197,"<price>1800<rating>80<whiskey>BenRiach 40 year old, 50%<review>Perhaps the oldest BenRiach on the market. I have great respect for whisky that has somehow managed to survive this many years without being bottled. If you want to taste a piece of history (which I can understand) and have unlimited funds, then go ahead and buy this. But, for the money, I prefer the BenRiach 25 year old (or even the 30 year old) to this whisky. Deeply layered oak -- from dried, spicy oak to juicy, damp oak. Notes of perfumed vanilla, roasted chestnut, and orange marmalade accentuate the oak. Pretty good for 40, but its best years are behind it."
3198,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 12 year old, 46%<review>Matured in bourbon casks for 10 years, followed by 2 years of finishing in ruby port pipes from the quintas, or wine estates, of Portugal. Stewed fruits, cloves, and port-soaked oak on the nose, which carry over to the sweet, viscous palate, along with milky coffee, fruit spices, and cereal. The overall effect of sticky sweetness lingers through the finish."
3199,"<price>48<rating>82<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Isle of Jura 1989 Vintage) 13 year old, 46%<review>Gold color. Aroma of vanilla, honeyed malt, subtle marshmallow, with background herbal, hay-like notes. Light and creamy in body. Creamy, malty, vanilla notes in flavor-honey sweet initially, but eventually drying out towards the finish, with soft herbal, grassy, hay notes. 
"
3200,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Old Malt Cask (distilled at Ardbeg) 1992 Vintage, 50%<review>(Reviewers note: this is an exclusive bottling to Park Avenue Liquors, New York, NY.) This is signature Ardbeg: young (but not too young), bold, and with an attitude too! Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown on a campfire, with notes of damp earth, pepper, and seaweed. Still, there’s a soft underbelly of vanilla sweetness that helps to tame this beast and provide balance. A peppery, kippered, smoky finish entertains long after the whisky disappears. Make this your last whisky of the evening."
3201,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>O’Begley Poitin, 50%<review>A locally-grown mashbill of 75% barley, 20% malt, 5% oats. Very aromatic for unaged spirit: fresh, grainy, a bit feinty/vegetal, split rock, and a note like well-rinsed crisp sauerkraut. It’s a quick and lively one in the mouth, sweet and slippery, grain and hints of fresh herbs (fennel, mace, white peppercorn). The finish is a bit sticky—the oats, maybe—and sweet. Interesting stuff."
3202,"<price>180<rating>87<whiskey>Talisker Neist Point, 45.8%<review>A showcase of the wide range of Talisker’s characteristics. Very sweet fruits, vanilla, new leather, and a hint of brine on the nose. Smooth on the palate, with smoky dark berries, lively spices, and crème brûlée. Dark chocolate and slightly bitter tannins feature in the finish, along with ginger and very mild chili. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
3203,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Laphroaig Cairdeas, 50.5%<review>Distinctively pale in color. (A hint of its age?) This annual limited edition release is finally available in the U.S. Youthful, vibrant, and thumping, with the sea flowing through its veins. Coal tar, peat smoke, brine, seaweed, bright fruit (pear, tangerine), and soft vanilla all compete for attention. The only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful."
3204,"<price>117<rating>91<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Fino, 57.6%<review>Each cask of this nicely packaged malt is selected by the distiller, and so there is considerable variation between batches. This one is a step up from last year's releases. It's slightly weaker, but the nose has firmed up into a delightful mix of fresh juicy grape and a spicy dustiness. Tastewise this takes an amazing journey from plummy, sweet fruit up front to a slow dominance of dry sherry at the end. The finish is longer than before. Excellent. "
3205,"<price>130<rating>79<whiskey>Isle of Jura 21 year old, 43%<review>Jura’s newest offering, and the oldest in the portfolio. It is drastically different than its younger siblings-this one is quite sherried, as its deep amber color with reddish hues suggests. I really enjoy how this whisky tastes on the palate-it’s rich and silky with notes of fruitcake, toffee, maple, orange chocolate truffle, cinnamon, and nutmeg. You’ll find the same notes on the nose, but there are also elements-cloying fruit, perfume, and a peculiar fleshy component-which detract from an otherwise lovely whisky. 
"
3206,"<price>46<rating>93<whiskey>Angel’s Envy, 43.3%<review>Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey finished in a port pipe. This is veteran master distiller Lincoln Henderson’s newest creation, and it’s a beauty. Richly textured, silky, and well-rounded, with ripe berried fruits, candied tangerine, light toffee, maple syrup, and creamy vanilla, sprinkled with spice (cinnamon, hint of mint). Smooth, silky finish, and dangerously drinkable! The port pipe notes dovetail perfectly. Lovely just the way it is, but it’s begging for a cigar. My only gripe: why not 45 or 50% ABV? But I’m splitting hairs. I really enjoy this stuff!"
3207,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Writers’ Tears Double Oak, 46%<review>This blend of single malt and pot still whiskeys exhibits the incredible synergy between chocolate, cinnamon, and pot still spices. Vinous at times from partial cognac-cask maturation, this has aromas of dark berry fruit, cinnamon, fudge, milk chocolate, malt biscuits, jellied fruit, and a smudge of dry spices. Compelling, well-structured whiskey, with cinnamon, chocolate, dark toffee, pepper, and ginger. It’s never cloying, nor overly sweet, just a richly rewarding glass."
3208,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Strathcolm The Extra Special, 40%<review>This opens promisingly with creamy, buttery aromas of vanilla frosting, toasted crumpets, and dry spices, and delivers on that promise in flavor. A charming silky texture with vanilla sweetness, hints of lemon, spice, and flavors of baked goods arriving in time for the finish of toasted spice. One to splash over ice and sip in the great outdoors. (6,000 bottles)"
3209,"<price>100<rating>95<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Single Barrel (2014 Release), 60%<review>Aged 11 years, this year’s single barrel release is a lively mix of caramel and bright, zingy orange on palate entry. Cinnamon, vanilla, and mint emerge mid-palate, leading to polished oak, baked apple, and a hint of leather on the finish. A lively bourbon, with crisp, clean flavors and nicely balanced. Another winner from Four Roses."
3210,"<price>101<rating>92<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique Cask Strength, 59.2%<review>Kavalan is Taiwanese whisky from the King Car Company, and the progress its whiskeys are making is truly remarkable. With humidity roughly the same as Speyside — high — but the temperature more than 20° Fahrenheit  higher, maturation is on fast forward. This is just 4 years old, but it’s a monster mix of kumquat liqueur, tropical fruit, blackcurrant, and strawberry and cream candy. Later on some eastern spices, especially turmeric, bring it all back home. Remarkable. €70 Currently not available in the U.S."
3211,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Big Peat Christmas Edition 2014, 55.7%<review>Brace yourself. This takes peat to the extreme, conjuring up a moist, chocolate slab of peat being cut and lifted out of the bog. So smoky, you will feel like you’re breathing in the dense clouds rising above the smoldering kilns. A punchy thwack of peat at full strength, and even if you cut it with water, it only highlights salty fishboxes and some buttery caramels cowering from the backdraft. A deliberately singular character, but utterly brilliant nonetheless. £46"
3212,"<price>68<rating>87<whiskey>Mackmyra Blomstertid, 46.1%<review>Angela D’Orazio matured a third of the component whiskies in cherry-wine casks for this seasonal creation. Rather than cherries, the fruity aroma of the wine is more apparent on the nose, together with crushed root ginger, hawthorn, drying tobacco leaf, and beefsteak tomatoes. This thick-textured dram exudes cherry, strawberry, and vanilla fudge, drawing the mouth before a late phase of rum and raisin, aniseed, peppermint, and menthol. 598 SEK"
3213,"<price>55<rating>80<whiskey>Wemyss The Spice King 12 Year Old, 40%<review>The least assertive of the Wemyss 12 year old range, and the most flighty. There's nothing wrong here, and the whisky's well-made and won't disappoint, but when you compare the spice hit here with what's on offer with other malts, this isn't shouting loudly enough. £35"
3214,"<price>155<rating>81<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Aultmore) 20 year old 1982, 46%<review>Aultmore is part of the Dewar’s stable and another of Speyside’s forgotten light brigade. Here is a noseful of esters: bubblegum, pineapple, pink grapefruit, strawberries, and icing sugar. Visions of “Legally Blonde” flash through the mind. The palate is equally energetic, though with little cask influence it’s a bit gawky and slightly green, especially with water, suggesting that another year wouldn’t have done it any harm. Still, all very lovely.  £100"
3215,"<price>40<rating>74<whiskey>Koval Raksi Millet, 40%<review>A lively light fruitiness (white grapes, green plum) in the nose. Quite grainy, but with an interesting hint of vanilla and a slight saltiness. Finish is a bit astringent, unlike the other Koval spirits. I’m finding these an interesting exercise in distillation, and educational. "
3216,"<price>135<rating>88<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old The Malts Blend, 40%<review>This strikes an earnest tone with a nose of rich fruit, dried apricot, whole orange, macadamia nut, ground spices, and pepper crackers. A blend of 21 malts, and the first blended malt in Royal Salute’s 66-year history, this has a harmonious palate comprising citrus, apple, pear, barley sugar, and ginger spice, with a finish focused on orange and a little spice."
3217,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy, 67.4%<review>A six-plus year old, barrel-strength rye whiskey. Young rye whiskeys show the true personality of the rye grain, and this is an excellent example. Bold spice notes of fresh mint, fiery cinnamon, and resinous clove. Sweeter notes of candied fruit, brandy, caramel, honey-tinged vanilla, and a suggestion of marzipan add balance. If you like your whiskeys young, bold, and unforgiving, this one’s for you."
3218,"<price>26<rating>81<whiskey>Old Forester Signature, 50%<review>Brown-Forman has made Old Forester since 1870. It sure is easy on the eyes: beautiful tawny hues against the light of sunset. Think Southern bakery. Lots of caramel, vanilla, freshly baked cornbread, nutmeg, cherry pie, and cocoa. Then add the spiciness. These delicious flavors don’t last long, making me wonder how it would fare with just a couple more years in the barrel."
3219,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Caol Ila Stitchell Reserve, 59.6%<review>Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty."
3220,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Glenkinchie 12 year old, 43%<review>Floral on the nose and quite delicate, with citrus fruit, spicy vanilla, walnuts, and cereal. The palate is smooth, with malt, orchard fruits, toffee apples, and graham crackers. An herbal note features early in the slowly drying finish."
3221,"<price>23<rating>77<whiskey>Wild Turkey Spiced, 43%<review>An odd roaring noseful of spices: vanilla, pepper, ginger, teaberry. Tastes perfumey first, then resolves to sweet vanilla, hot oak, and more teaberry. Can’t decide if it wants to be bourbon—it’s hot, and flexing oak—or candy, and does a poor job at both; it’s like a linebacker in a French maid’s outfit, just wrong. There are much better sweet, spicy whiskey mixes out there; the original Spicebox comes to mind."
3222,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Buchanan’s Master, 40%<review>This adheres to the rules laid down by blender Keith Law. The nose yields mint toffees, cereal notes, butterscotch, and whole peppercorn. Juicy orange, with elements of burnt orange, dark toffees, and a pleasant balance of sweetness form the palate, followed by a wave of peppery spices and late dashes of dates and sultana. The finish has more peppery spice and peppermint. Obey the Law."
3223,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Forty Creek Port Wood Reserve 2012 Edition, 45%<review>Opinion is seriously divided on whether this or an earlier Port Wood edition is the best thing ever to come from John K. Hall’s Forty Creek distillery in Grimsby, Ontario. A winemaker, Hall used his own port barrels to finish a mature blend of barley, corn, and rye whiskies. Stewed prunes, butterscotch, and licorice rule the nose, while the palate broadens into savory herbs, spiced fruit, sweet pipe tobacco, and hints of, yes, gunpowder. C$70"
3224,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Arran Madeira Wine Cask Finish (2008 Limited Edition), 50%<review>This is not a single-cask bottling like other recent wine-finished releases, but the casks they selected are very good ones. Lovely antique amber color. The Madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak, and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. Lush notes of orange marmalade, raspberry tart, and panforte, all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa. A dry, resinous, spicy, tactile finish adds balance, complexity, and additional dimension. Smartly bottled at a higher strength. Some of these wine-finished Arran whiskies are impressive. This is one of them."
3225,"<price>400<rating>95<whiskey>Brora, 30 year old, 55.7%<review>Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak, and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine, with honeyed vanilla, mustard seed, green olive, Seville orange, and lemon zest. Underlying smoke, damp peat, and seaweed. Put simply, Brora at its finest. 
"
3226,"<price>69<rating>86<whiskey>The Dalmore Dee Dram, 40%<review>With the percentage of former oloroso sherry-matured spirit ramped up to 60 percent in this Dee variant, the nose is deeper and richer than that of the Tweed Dram; Seville orange marmalade and a hint of cocoa. More immediate dark chocolate on the palate, with raisins and walnuts. The finish is lengthy, with plums, black coffee, and a suggestion of licorice. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
3227,"<price>20<rating>88<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 6 year old, 45%<review>Youthful and very lively. Bold, crisp, spices (mint, cinnamon, vanilla) are softened by soothing, sweeter notes (candied fruit, coconut, caramel, and rum notes), becoming dry, flinty, and spicy on the finish. It is very clean and polished, and it is superior to other rye whiskeys in this age range. Nicely done!"
3228,"<price>180<rating>91<whiskey>Dalmore Cigar Malt Reserve, 44%<review>Aged in a mix of American white oak barrels, oloroso casks, and cabernet sauvignon barriques. Sherry, vanilla, caramel, ripe cherries, and sultanas on the nose. The palate yields characteristic Dalmore orange, plus brittle toffee, bitter chocolate, and cherry liqueur. Spicy licorice and soft oak in the finish."
3229,"<price>386<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1981 (Cask #57), 50.8%<review>This is a refill (or in 'Farclas terms, ‘plain’) hogshead, so there is less wood on show and more distillery. The nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat, some pipe tobacco, polished wood, and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. The palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). There’s decent grip; think treacle this time. Fluxes and changes, which makes it all the more intriguing. £246"
3230,"<price>70<rating>96<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 71.4%<review>Another excellent Stagg, and considering its alcohol level, it’s also a good value if you can get it at this price. Notes of toffee, pot still rum, nougat, dates, tobacco, roasted nuts, polished oak, and leather. Great depth and nicely balanced. A masculine bourbon of character and structure."
3231,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>The Pogues, 40%<review>Named for the greatest London-Irish band of the 1980s, this produces stewed apple, raisin, vanilla cream, peppercorn, grated nutmeg, and a dirty ol’ mound of dunnage earth. A fiesta of apple, pineapple, grapefruit, bitter lemon, subdued honey, and caramel transition into stewed apples, rhubarb, lemon bonbons, and sweet vanilla. Lingering bitterness, like the band’s split. It’s a Big Apple Fairytale, but for the money, better streams of whiskey are available."
3232,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Pike Creek 10 year old, 40%<review>This soft, fruity luxury is a stablemate to Corby’s Lot No. 40, and another resurrected member of the once-lost Canadian Whisky Guild. Hiram Walker’s distillery, where Pike Creek is made, is one of the largest in North America. However, the owner, Pernod-Ricard, encourages creativity and innovation as well as product reliability. Gingery dark fruits mingle with canned fruit and clean oak, while a peppery nuttiness lingers below soft red wine and white grapefruit. C$40"
3233,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>WhistlePig 15 year old Vermont Estate Oak Straight Rye Whisky, 46%<review>WhistlePig does nothing by half measures. They had massive oak trees culled from their Vermont property, coopered into heavily-charred barrels, then used them to finish batches of already mature 100% rye. Layer on layer of soft vanilla, old lumber, cinnamon, fresh orange peels, baking spice, dark fruits, and medicinal hints of resin. Peppery hot and oakily sweet. A slight dustiness and a big juicy butterscotch kiss."
3234,"<price>89<rating>93<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Rye (batch PSF3), 45%<review>Masterson’s bottles singular rye whisky. Yes, this 100% rye-grain whisky is sourced, but finishing by 3 Badge Beverage in French oak casks makes it their own. Booming, gingery spices cavort on a creamy, leathery, almost oily palate. Snappy sour pickles and vague herbal notes contrast pointedly with sweet vanilla and hints of milk chocolate, dried black fruit, and aromatic pipe tobacco."
3235,"<price>126<rating>88<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Celebration, 40%<review>Available only at the distillery or online, and limited to 5,000 special decanters, this is a special Famous Grouse release to mark the 30th anniversary of the blend. Be careful, though:  it's not a 30 year old blend. But it is excellent and there's lots of very old, woody, and ripe malt in the mix. As Highland Park and The Macallan are in the stable, expect a fruity, oaky, superbly balanced treat.  £80"
3236,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Elijah Craig Small Batch, 47%<review>A solid, basic bourbon, with pure sweetness, honey, marzipan, and wildflower notes. The sweet drive is nicely backed with drying oak on the pronounced finish, like sucking on a sweet and woody cherry Popsicle stick. A simple and enjoyable crowd pleaser, and smaller sibling to the Barrel Proof, our 2017 Whisky of the Year."
3237,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Penderyn Portwood Single Malt, 46%<review>Subtle, well-judged port cask influence integrates well with the Penderyn spirit to produce an entrancing whisky. Substantial aromas of chocolate, dried fruits, dates, cocoa, snuff, and a prickle of spices rise from the glass. There’s good weight in the mouth, with flavors of chocolate, gingersnap, dates, dried cranberry, forest honey, a supportive chorus of spices, and a heavenly finish of dark sweet fruits. (792 bottles for U.S.)"
3238,"<price>196<rating>80<whiskey> Mackmyra Moment Norrsken, 53.2%<review>Moment is a series of special one-off single malt whisky releases, and allows the distillery to experiment with cask types. Some of the whiskies, such as this one, take the distillery back to an earlier, more intense and difficult era. So here we have mushroomy, earthy whisky with damp autumn leaves, artichoke, tobacco, and salted fish in the mix. It's a full-on savory experience, and not one for the faint-hearted. SEK 1295"
3239,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Arran ‘The Devil’s Punch Bowl,’ 52.3%<review>6,660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released, and the component whiskies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts, and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft, mellow malt, dried fruits, and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength, the palate is nutty and notably fruity, with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish."
3240,"<price>53<rating>89<whiskey>Pike Creek 15 year old Ontario Cabernet Sauvignon Barrel-Finished, 42%<review>This masterpiece of wine finishing yields a massive fruity nose with rich maple
toffee, greyed cedar, barrel wood, and baseball glove. A sweet, very fruity complex
palate features black pepper, cinnamon hearts, bristling spices, slightly bitter pulling
tannins, red wine, figs, and sandalwood. A longish finish shows grape tannins,
grapefruit pith, and red wine over maple notes and tingling spices. $70 CAD"
3241,"<price>85<rating>72<whiskey>Benromach Origins 1999 Vintage (Batch 1), 50%<review>Origins is Benromach’s new program to highlight different aspects of whisky-making, which I think is a great idea. This expression focuses on the use of Golden Promise barley to make the malt, which is then aged in a sherry cask. Unfortunately, there’s so much sherry here that I struggle to appreciate the impact or distinction from the Golden Promise barley. Notes of ripe orchard fruit, tangerine, beeswax, sticky toffee pudding, and toasted almond. Lingering smoke and waxed fruit stays through to the finish. A weighty Benromach (from the Golden Promise and/or the sherry). I find the nose pleasant enough, but the sherry-induced waxed fruit component that emerges mid-palate is just too dominant."
3242,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch #1), 48%<review>A new small-batch addition to the Aberlour line-up, Casg Annamh (Gaelic for ‘rare cask’) has been matured in European and American oak oloroso sherry casks. Rich, buttery caramel aromas, grilled pineapple, and ginger. The palate is smooth, and yields spicy vanilla, tangerines, and cloves. Lots of black pepper and licorice in the relatively long finish. Less complex than the distillery’s A’bunadh."
3243,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>Port Ellen, 1979 vintage, 28 year old, 53.8%<review>The seventh limited edition release of Port Ellen whiskies by Diageo. Not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose), but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. Notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke, coal tar, fish nets, and charred oak. Seaweed and brine, more reserved mid-palate, emerges noticeably on the finish. The Port Ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. This one still captures the essence of Port Ellen. 
"
3244,"<price>270<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park ICE Edition, 53.9%<review>ICE Edition is a 17 year old matured predominantly in bourbon casks. Just 30,000 rather extravagantly presented bottles are available globally.  Fresh and fruity on the nose with light trademark Highland Park sweet smoke, ginger, and a hint of dry earth. In time the fruits become more clearly defined as pears and peaches. Full and viscous on the palate; vanilla, pepper, brief orchard fruits, then dry peat, licorice, aniseed, and a lingering, relatively dry finish."
3245,"<price>170<rating>81<whiskey>Scott's Selection (distilled at Longmorn), 33 year old, 1971 Vintage, 53.5%<review>Succulent, sappy, with plenty of oak. This whisky is quite fruity, with tangerine, lemon, and strawberries. It is balanced by fat barley, almonds and damp oak. It is not as polished and rounded as the Gordon & Macphail Longmorn reviewed above. Indeed, the fruity, damp oak notes can be quite dominant in this whisky. However, the whisky evolves constantly on the palate and there are some minty, spicy underlying notes which add intrigue. Definitely save this one for after dinner. 
"
3246,"<price>130<rating>88<whiskey>Dalmore 15 year old, 40%<review>Finished in sherry casks. The nose is slightly reticent, with orange peel, instant coffee, and a hint of burning coal. More obvious orange notes on the palate, with milk chocolate and drying oak. Dark chocolate and slightly bitter oak in the medium-length finish."
3247,"<price>282<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Littlemill) 36 year old, 40.2%<review>Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175"
3248,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Templeton 6 year old Rye, 45.75%<review>A burst of orange on the nose: orange blossom, orange peel, orange pekoe tea, candied orange slices. It also has sweet licorice, sage, honey, and blueberry. Light-bodied in the mouth with a bit of astringency; the flavors run to berry, orange, spearmint, and cinnamon, with gentle spice. On the finish, more fruit and cinnamon prevail, along with nuttiness and an undercurrent of herbal pine."
3249,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 70.9%<review>Stagg is so smooth, it’s quite drinkable at higher proofs. On the other hand, when you bring it down to the strength that you would normally drink your whiskey, it’s almost too easygoing (I made the same comment about last year’s William Larue Weller bottling). The main theme to this whiskey is lush toffee sweetness and, like last year’s expression, some vanilla fudge, nougat, and molasses. Underlying notes of dates, tobacco, dark berried fruit, spearmint, and a hit of coffee round out the palate. Given the higher strength, it’s a true value bourbon -- almost like getting two bottles in one. A very nice whiskey but, when brought down to comparable strength, the Eagle Rare 17 has more complexity."
3250,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 30 year old Glenrothes 1989 Single Cask (Cask No. 18177), 41.9%<review>The nose is aromatic, with peach blossom, apple skins, sugared strawberries, strands of cotton candy, biscuity malt, blanched almonds, and green tea leaves. Rounded and soft on the palate, there are flavors of apricots, peaches, and bright red cherries, firmly supported by malt; with water, the fruit is more pronounced and uplifted by a bracing tide of nuts, milk chocolate, oak, and tea leaves. The finish retains fruitiness but is focused on nuts, tobacco, and leathery oak. (92 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3251,"<price>132<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park “Saint Magnus,” 55%<review>The second in a series of three high-strength, limited edition Highland Park whiskies, and a rather bold expression. Nicely sherried and noticeably smoky — more than a standard Highland Park. Quite spicy too — with cinnamon, but also ginger and nutmeg. Throw in some toffee apple, Cointreau, and waxed fruit for intrigue. Long, sherried, smoky finish. A very exciting whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£85"
3252,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight (Batch C920), 66.4%<review>
Spice and fresh herbs on the nose, yielding to lemon meringue pie, peach tart, whipped cream, and baking spice. Bakery notes of cherry pie and red berries get things going on the palate, followed by sweet notes of vanilla wafer and frosted yellow cupcake atop herbs and spice, all accentuated with water. A long finish of Boston cream pie, coconut ice cream, baking spice, zesty herbs, and cigar ash."
3253,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Blade and Bow, 45.5%<review>This whiskey is produced utilizing a solera system, similar to the way sherry is aged, and is said to contain some whiskey distilled at Stitzel-Weller. Thick and viscous in texture. Orchard fruit (orange, apricot, pear) on the front of the palate, segueing to honeyed vanilla, dried pit fruits, and dried spice (evergreen, cinnamon), leading to a warm finish. Intriguing, but lacking polish to garner a higher rating."
3254,"<price>71<rating>82<whiskey>Bakery Hill, Double Wood, 46%<review>Tasmania may be setting itself up as the Speyside of Australia, but there are a growing number of distilleries on the mainland, such as Bakery Hill in Bayswater on the Dadenong foothills of Victoria, which was started by David Baker in 1999. Working with tall stills, his aim is to make a lightly fragrant spirit, and certainly that intense banana-like quality is there on nose and palate while the use of sherry casks adds a fruitcake and golden raisin depth. "
3255,"<price>48<rating>92<whiskey>Big Peat Small Batch, 53.6%<review>The original Big Peat was a mix of smoky Islay malts and was already up there with the very best competition in the category, even though many of the others were bottled at cask strength. I scored it at 90. Now it’s back to play in the big boys' pool with a killer cask strength whisky of its own. This is to whisky what AC/DC is to heavy rock: old school, predictable, but great and exactly what fans want."
3256,"<price>80<rating>81<whiskey>Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Miltonduff, 43%<review>A light, oily nose, a little nutty, baked apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, and malt biscuits. There are seductive dark spices and cooked fruit, almost savory, like lifting the lid on a tagine. A thinner mouthfeel showing some lime zest before a warm, enveloping glow of malt sweetness, gentle spice, toffee, raisin, and char emerges. Savory, peppery finish. Like nightfall, it gets darker the longer you contemplate it. With water, sweeter with more candied citrus as honeys materialize."
3257,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Eau Claire Ploughman’s Rye, 43%<review>From rye grown in a single Alberta field, cultivated and harvested using horse-drawn farm machinery, this whisky was aged in new American oak, then finished in the distillery’s single malt barrels. The nose is dry, clean, and herbal: slatey, with hints of cereal. Quite sweet on the palate, with peaches, berries, kiwi, and exotic fruits. Warming and spicy, smoky but not hot, with hints of pancake syrup. Finishes long, silky, and slippery. $73 CAD "
3258,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Jura 16 year old Diurachs’ Own, 43%<review>Diurachs are the inhabitants of the Isle of Jura, and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in amoroso sherry casks. Floral and honeyed on the nose, with caramel, pine, and spicy dark chocolate. Sweet and oily on the palate, where the chocolate changes from plain to milk, with vanilla and delicate cloves. Darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish."
3259,"<price>45<rating>77<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Bunnahabhain) cask #5279 1997 vintage 9 year old, 59.9%<review>The owners of Bunnahabhain are making a peated version of this normally unpeated Islay whisky to put in their peated blend, Black Bottle. But they have not yet put out, as a regular item, a peated expression of Bunnahabhain for purchase. However, some of the independent bottlers got their hands on some, and this might be the first one to be offered in the U.S. It’s what you would expect a 9 year old peated Bunnahabhain to taste like: toffee, vanilla fudge, and nuts (the Bunny signature), kiln peat smoke, and a bit too much youthfulness. It needs a few more years to mature to acceptable levels. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
3260,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Longmorn) 28 year old, 51.6%<review>The nose is fascinating, as if dust is cohering into form, and fruity form at that. When it emerges there’s baked banana, fruitcake, citrus peels, passion fruit, mango, mace flower, and nutmeg. A mossy edge anchors it to earth. Even livelier with water, this is a superbly balanced, mature whisky. The palate is pure, with big retronasal impact of the spice. Layered and long, it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. Superb."
3261,"<price>95<rating>78<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at North British; batch 2), 49.3%<review>Papier mâché, adhesives, lemongrass, green cardamom, peanut, pear, and other aromatic, fruity characteristics create a puzzling aroma profile. On sipping, there is fruity baked apple, sherbet, and glowing light citrus notes of orange, grapefruit, and lime, with a medium weight structure. The flavors tip toward a slight sour fruit note, but as this flattens out, creaminess rules. The finish suffers a short, quick death, leaving mild, sour fruit. Water brings crystallized lemon on the nose and sweeter, light fruits. £63"
3262,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Brora) 18 year old, 1983, 43%<review>Pale gold/straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma and flavor of brine, delicate peat, gentle sweetness, and a touch of spice and seaweed. Medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Nicely balanced and clean, with a salty, dryish finish. This is a lovely, very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (It was the original Clynelish distillery.) It is a very nice example of a northern Highland whisky, and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine, youth and maturity. However, I would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength."
3263,"<price>485<rating>92<whiskey>Glenrothes Vintage 1988 2nd Edition, 44.1%<review>Matured in a mixture of first-fill American sherry hogsheads and refill sherry butts, this is rich and fragrant on the nose, with dark berries and marzipan, then glacé cherries and wood polish. The palate is voluptuous with spicy dark fruit, Christmas cake, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of dark rum. Dried fruits in the finish, with raisins, aniseed, and soft oak. Finally, plain chocolate. Superb! £375"
3264,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Kilkerran 12 year old, 46%<review>After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases, Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. It comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey and a hint of brine, then peaty fruit notes develop. The palate is confident and oily, slightly earthy, with tinned peaches, black pepper, cinnamon, smoke, and a suggestion of medicine chests. The finish is relatively long, with pepper, licorice, and drying oak."
3265,"<price>43<rating>83<whiskey>Breizh, 42%<review>The price tag — higher than the entry level single malt — gives an indication as to what to expect from this blend, and it's a cracker. Made with 50 percent grain and 50 percent malt, the taste here is punctuated by a distinctive and unusual salt and pepper delivery. Beyond that there's creamy vanilla, soft peach, and a creamy rounded finish. It really dares to be different. €32 "
3266,"<price>66<rating>92<whiskey>The Feathery, 40%<review>Chocolate-covered raisins scoffed on a heathery moor, leather riding tack, intense plain chocolate, malt loaf, mixed nuts, Medjool dates, and traces of wood ash. A gorgeous, unctuous mouthfeel with flavors spun around bright sparks of orange, dark toffee, and rich maltiness, melding to black cherry, stewed fruits, licorice, and charred oak. Named for the leather golf balls packed with goose feathers used in the early 19th century. Sink one for a birdie. From the bottlers of Sheep Dip. £39"
3267,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Bendt No. 5 American Blended Whiskey, 41.5%<review>Primary grain flavors of Cheerios and spirit notes of rubber tire suggest some youth here. The palate is very sweet, surprisingly sweet in fact, with cloying malt extract, honey, pear nectar, and a bit of lemon oil. There are some redeeming flavors, but this generally feels disjointed."
3268,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>GlenAllachie 12 year old, 46%<review>This expression is described by the distillers as “the heart of our range.” Matured in virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and oloroso casks. Oily on the nose, with ripe banana and a hint of oak. Quite full-bodied and slick on the palate, with vanilla, honey, and almonds. Milk chocolate and lime in the medium-length finish."
3269,"<price>78<rating>88<whiskey>Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 07, 43%<review>In 2009, brewers Bob Baxter and Alan Hansen added a stillhouse to their Whitehorse-based Yukon Brewing Company. This 7 year old, their seventh whisky, was distilled from Scottish peated malt, creating a smoky, malty, scotch-like nose. Ripe apples, apricots, and other sweet fruits subdue the smoke until the first sip, when it bursts to the fore with a sweet, ashy presence. Smoke and pleasing hot pepper dominate a long finish. (Canada only) $100 CAD"
3270,"<price>126<rating>92<whiskey>Canadian Club 1960s, 40%<review>Fifty years on, the standard Canadian Club becomes very complex and in-your-face delicious. Barley sugar sweetness blossoms into creamy caramel in a dark, heavy, full-bodied whisky with cinnamon, hot chewing tobacco, and sizzling spice. Acetone, dry wood, and peaches on the nose give way to musty perfumed sandalwood and fresh crisp oak, with glowing embers in the throat. Floral, sweet, and a bit nutty, it finishes slowly in leather and furniture polish. (Australia only) A$164"
3271,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Breckenridge Bourbon, 43%<review>WHACK! The spicy smack of the nose sends me to check the mashbill; sure enough, this is 38% rye. The nose fumes with youthful zest: cinnamon, bright mint, sun-warmed green grass. Pour some on the palate for more explosive entertainment; sweet cinnamon red-hots burst, corn pops, and the oak burns on into the rye-high finish. This is one excitable boy of a bourbon, and it’s got me humming along. Impressive. "
3272,"<price>16<rating>84<whiskey>Jamie Stewart, 40%<review>With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee, vanilla, toasted whole grain bread, and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices, especially cinnamon and pepper, are quelled by malty caramel, baked orange, and touches of old leather. The finish is dry, malty, and slightly nutty, with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall."
3273,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Blue Note Juke Joint Straight Bourbon, 46.5%<review>An easy drinker, with typical caramel and vanilla notes tinged with herbal flavors of horehound and pine boughs. Nicely balances bright fruit and sweetness with generous rye spice, suggesting an oatmeal cookie with vanilla frosting. While not overly complex, flavors are nicely integrated with charred oak. (5,000 bottles)"
3274,"<price>147<rating>91<whiskey>Talisker 15 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 57.3%<review>The first 15 year old release from Talisker, this was matured in freshly charred American oak hogsheads. Marzipan, damp tweed, cooking chocolate, and white pepper on the nose, with light iodine and peat notes. Notably sweet on the palate, with fleshy oranges, peaches, cocoa powder, woodsmoke, and peppery peat. The finish is medium to long, with quite restrained Talisker pepperiness. £110"
3275,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey>Elijah Craig 23 year old (Barrel No. 26), 45%<review>Yes, 23 years is a long time to age bourbon. And yes, there’s plenty of oak influence. But there’s an underlying sweetness that balances the oak spice (with this particular cask; others may vary). Chewy in texture, with toffee, dates, fig cake (with nuts), barrel char, tobacco, leather, and a dusting of cocoa."
3276,"<price>27<rating>82<whiskey>John B. Stetson, 42%<review>Easy-going and uncluttered, but also not very complex. Balanced, straightforward notes of caramel, vanilla, creamed corn, subtle fruit, soft mint, and delicate cinnamon. A versatile bourbon: you won’t feel guilty using it in a cocktail, and it will do in a pinch to drink neat or with a splash of water.  "
3277,"<price>85<rating>88<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Moray) 9 year old, 55.7%<review>Distilled in September 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315), this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful Speyside malt can be, given the right cask. Soft and fragrant on the nose, with lemongrass, ginger snaps, and light toffee notes. The palate is sweet, with ripe strawberries and spicy fudge. A spicy finish offers cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lingering citrus fruits. (220 bottles)"
3278,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Eifel Peated Single Malt (2019 Release), 46%<review>I’m calling this the pitmaster’s dram: the nose has muscular peat smoke, prune juice, savory notes of barbecued brisket bark, venison charcuterie, and a hint of peppermint cream. The palate is a gluttonous feast of sweet dark fruits, milk chocolate, dried fig, plum, sultanas, and ginger, sliding into baked orange and spicy gingerbread, and wallowing luxuriously in chocolate and rich fruit. A welcome addition to Eifel’s already impressive range. (1,200 bottles for the U.S.)"
3279,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>The Glenrothes Alba Reserve, 40%<review>Matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels (American white oak, or quercus alba), and certified kosher. It’s a softer, gentler version of Glenrothes. The bourbon oak influence is very evident, showing creamy vanilla and coconut, with additional fruit (orange creamsicle, pineapple, black raspberry, blueberry, and gooseberry). Soft, creamy vanilla finish. A pleasant, easy-going, seamless dram—and perhaps the most approachable Glenrothes whisky."
3280,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Glen Elgin) 21 year old, 50.1%<review>This single cask bottling was distilled in December 1995 and matured in a refill hogshead (#258). Warm, sweet biscuit notes on the nose, plus almonds and tangerines. Substantial on the palate, with vanilla fudge and Jaffa orange. Softly spicy, with developing licorice. Long in the finish, with spicy licorice, plain chocolate, and light tannins. (258 bottles)"
3281,"<price>156<rating>88<whiskey>The Dalmore Cromartie, 45%<review>The Dalmore Cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The release is limited to 7,500 bottles. A floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather, along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery, citrus notes. Rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate, with soft, smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy. The finish is long and spicy, majoring on cinnamon, with more dark chocolate, overripe orange, and a hint of licorice. £100"
3282,"<price>220<rating>94<whiskey>Glenmorangie Signet, 46%<review>An innovative offering made with a proportion of chocolate malt and matured in virgin American oak. Some of the component whiskies are between 35 and 40 years old. Milk chocolate, honey, orange marmalade, sultanas, and spice on the inviting nose. The palate is rich and full, with malt, dates, Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, and coffee beans. Long and spicy in the drying finish. Glenmorangie at its very best."
3283,"<price>35<rating>80<whiskey>Twisted Manzanita Rebellious Rye, 47.5%<review>A “whiskey distilled from rye malt mash,” which indicates aging in used barrels. Still has a deep coloring from port barrel finishing. Nose is quite peppery, youthfully vegetal, and sweet with fruit, again, presumably from the port barrel. Rye grassiness and spice in the mouth, wrapped with layers of port fruit and pepperiness that roll into the finish. Smooth for the strength, though the port is pushy and the flavors could be better balanced. An interesting direction."
3284,"<price>1750<rating>87<whiskey>Ladyburn 41 year old, 40%<review>Ladyburn malt distillery was part of William Grant’s Girvan grain distilling complex in Ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. It was located close to where Ailsa Bay now stands. This veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears, nectarines, subtle vanilla, and a hint of old hemp. Fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate, with worn leather and malt.  The fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak, licorice, and slightly bitter citrus notes."
3285,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>New Holland Beer Barrel-Finished Bourbon, 40%<review>Aromatic and expressive on the nose, with grapefruit, lemon, and orange peels, kiwi, green apple Hi-Chew, melon, and a hint of pine and dried leaves. The palate is light-bodied and clean, with citrus peel, melon, soft spice, sarsaparilla, and milk chocolate. It finishes short and gentle, but tasty, with candied rose petal, dried kiwi, and grape Fun Dip. While many beer-barrel finishes come on too strong, this one succeeds with subtlety."
3286,"<price>81<rating>91<whiskey>Port Askaig, 17 year old, 45.8% <review>A new line of Islay single malts from Specialty Drinks, an extension of The Whisky Exchange. (The bottle doesn’t tell you which distillery this whisky came from, but if you look at a map of Islay you can probably figure it out.) I like this expression better than the more expensive 25 year old. There’s impeccable balance and more vibrancy in this 17 year old, with seaweed, smoked Spanish olive, coal soot, pencil shavings, citrus, and anise, along with subtle kipper and picked ginger. All this is layered on a bed of oily, honeyed malt. Salty, peppery, sooty, tarry finish. Nicely done! £50"
3287,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Dingle Single Malt (Batch No. 3), 46.5%<review>Cut-open pomegranate, dried cranberry, and rose petals hint at the port cask influence on this whiskey. Brisket and roasted spice aromas of cumin, fennel, and coriander. Abundant red fruit flavors of cherry, redcurrant, and pomegranate are swept along on a wave of brown sugar sweetness, accompanied by flavors of gummy bear, root beer, clove, ginger, pepper, and aniseed. Sweet and spicy finish."
3288,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch A120), 68.3%<review>An herbal nose featuring menthol, eucalyptus, and horehound is endowed with plenty of earthy oak, evoking sawmill, empty wine casks, and dusty floorboards. Generous oak courses through the palate, the drying tannins reining in the dense sweetness as the whiskey brandishes bold spices, including allspice, pepper, and clove. Water gives this bourbon much needed room to run, revealing greater polish and rich layers of flavor."
3289,"<price>36<rating>83<whiskey>The Singleton of Glendullan, 12 year old, 40%<review>Clean, fragrant, and quite fruity, with notes of tangerine, lemon, pineapple, and kiwi. There's a creamy-almost oily-vanilla maltiness on the palate that binds the fruit together. Gently dry, subtly spicy finish. A pleasing, unpretentious whisky."
3290,"<price>81<rating>79<whiskey>Diggers & Ditch, 41.5%<review>Given that this is described as a blend and it's from the New Zealand Whisky Co., you'd be well within your rights to stay clear. But it's not, it’s a blend of two single malts from two different countries, New Zealand and Australia; what will soon be known as Hybrid. It's not the best from either country, dumbing down the big flavors and leaving the fruit and spice falling a little flat. Arguably another good entry level whisky, though.  NZ$95"

Gooey nose, with lots of dark chocolate, toffee, fruit (ripe honeydew, Asian pear, red plum); no hint of the 49.5% ABV heat. Deliciously layered palate: dry malt, juicy fruit, and savory wood spice, sweet malt and chocolate, and a finish that’s sweet, light, and quite refreshing and inviting. Lives up to the Charbay hype!"
3292,"<price>62<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism, 43%<review>Gold color. Delicate aromas of tropical fruits (coconut, pineapple, mango), marshmallow and vanilla. Light in body, with delicate exotic flavors that deliver what the aroma promises. Soft, gentle, delicately creamy finish."

Icing sugar, red cedar, and oak with pithy tannins and sizzling spices: pepper, hot cinnamon, and ginger. Then a fruitiness unfolds into crisp Granny Smith apples and chewy jujubes. Gradually, the layers peel back, revealing delicate hints of buttered popcorn, mealy marzipan, candy cane, and burley tobacco. The subtle earthiness of cooked corncobs complements sour fruits and sweet spices. Huge, complex, and beautifully balanced. (Canada only)  C$50"

Plenty of acidity and exotic spices at play. There’s a bouquet of citrus and botanical notes to sip. Smooth with a big slug of warmth: white peach, nectarine, melon, ground almond, sliced lemon, with spicy undertones. The finish is complex with plum skin, cooked gooseberry, tangerine oils, and tingle of sherbet. A little beauty, though the outturn seems woefully meager. (50 bottles) £150"

Drying, delicately minty finish. For those who love the richly elegant, non-sherried style of older Glenlivet whiskies."
3298,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Charbay Doubled & Twisted, 45%<review>A blend of 3 year old single malt (30%), 3 year old whiskey distilled from pilsner beer (20%), and 7 year old whiskey distilled from stout (30%). Unsurprisingly, the nose is hoppy, with an overlay of pine bough and a tropical fragrance of lemon and pineapple. The palate is deeper, with more hops and pine, plus bitter citrus, lime, and white pepper. The finish melds bitter chocolate, roasted pecans, and toasty oak. (3,960 bottles)"
3299,"<price>135<rating>83<whiskey>Old Hobart Overeem Port Cask Matured, 43%<review>If Tasmania is defining a distinctive whisky style, this is it. If you buy into the big red fruit and berry, full-frontal Aussie assault, accompanied by a rural earthiness, then this may be too ordered for you. But for most whisky drinkers exploring new territories the rounded red berry and orange fruits, and the full, rich, sweet center make it a perfect entry-level whisky to ease you in. A$130"

Initially, it lands light as a feather, introducing melon and green apple, becoming textured with cinnamon spices and nutmeg, and swirling with caramelized sugar sweetness. Complex, with fruit sourness and gooseberry notes adding depth to the flavor progression, leading to a dry and pure finish. Water adds sugariness: it’s preferable in its full-strength fighting Irish guise. (K&L Wines only, 380 bottles)"
3301,"<price>68<rating>84<whiskey>Springbank 10 year old, 46%<review>Thick barley and viscous, with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. Underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging), clementine, pineapple, and black licorice emerge, followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. The most rambunctious of the three."
3302,"<price>22<rating>67<whiskey>American Born Dixie Sweet Tea Moonshine, 41.5%<review>This flavored moonshine smells like a mass of wet, used tea bags. Underneath is some faint lemon, honey, and black pepper, but it’s hard to get to it through the tea. Entry is strong, oversteeped tea, which only gets stronger, more tannic, and more bitter in the mid-palate. Syrupy lemon honey tries and fails to balance this oversteeped mess. Finish is long, bitter, slightly hot, and unpleasant. Do not attempt to drink without copious amounts of crushed ice."

3304,"<price>90<rating>80<whiskey>Blackadder <review>Very pale gold color. Aggressive notes of tar, boat docks, seaweed, and smoke are tamed by a mouth-coating honeyed vanilla sweetness.

Autumn leaves, minerality, and earthy peat on the nose, along with mulling spices, apple, and pear tart. A malty balance of vanilla cream, lemon pie, and caramelized sugar fills the palate, followed by a lingering finish of spice and baked fruit. The third consecutive release of Cider Cask to score at least 90 points. (1,902 bottles)"
3306,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Jack Ryan The Centenary Single Barrel 15 year old, 57.5%<review>Warmed honey oozing over toasted English muffins, with dry spices and a twist of clementine peel. There’s a cool, clean freshness too. A satiny texture with an immediate wave of flavor engulfs the tongue; a big hit of citrus peel, not fruit, is joined by vanilla softness and a hint of nuttiness. This citrus turns delectably tangy and hangs in there, no matter how diluted it becomes. The tanginess persists into the long, lush, warming finish."
3307,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Kikori, 41%<review>Get back to nature; this is a whisky to savor during a spectacular sunrise. Lychee, edamame, pea shoots, green apple, and morning dew on lush lawns. As it warms and wakes up, there are hints of orange and some piquant spice. The taste jumps from lemongrass to lemon candies, with melon, mild peppercorn, gentle vanilla, creamy oak, and a few green notes at the end."
3308,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Scotia 15 year old, 46%<review>After initial maturation in bourbon casks, this expression underwent a 2-month finish in first-fill oloroso sherry casks. Initially it offers char, then ginger, honey, and sweet smoke on the nose, with apricot tarts and toffee. The palate is quite earthy and peppery, with stone fruit, cinnamon, sea salt, and light smokiness. Medium length in the finish, with citrus fruit and salty oak."
3309,"<price>45<rating>91<whiskey>Talisker Select Reserve, 45.8%<review>This represents House Greyjoy and features its kraken. The nose offers damp tweed sprinkled with black pepper, plus smoky vanilla and ozone notes. Sweet smoke and citrus fruit on the palate, then more overt peatiness comes to the fore with soft toffee. Medium in length through the finish, with lingering toffee and light pepper. Great value! Editor's Choice"
3310,"<price>260<rating>90<whiskey>Glenglassaugh, 26 year old, 46%<review>A polished whisky, light-medium in body with well-rounded flavors. Fruity (ripe orange, lemon gumdrops, candy apple), with creamy vanilla and a honeyed, toasted malt foundation. Soft, gentle oak throughout. What a lovely, gentle-natured whisky, straight down the middle! Bonus points for versatility. "
3311,"<price>78<rating>85<whiskey>Lg4 Elements of Islay (distilled at Lagavulin), 55.7%<review>Hard not to compare this to the 12 year old, as they are of similar strength and character. This is more about the peat bank rather than the shore, more eucalyptus than kelp. This pungent, earthy note is retained with water, alongside some brine. The palate is like carrageen moss pudding, with a touch of nutmeg at the end. Plenty there, but it all moves very quickly when I want it to linger. That said, a solid performer. £47/500 ml"
3312,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Balcones Texas Blue Corn Bourbon (Batch BCB17-1), 64.6%<review>The concentration here is impressive, as dates and raisins meet leathery oak that smells of a dusty tack shop, joined by some lovely cinnamon, clove, and spearmint. The intensity on the rich palate is face-melting, hot, and muscular. Sweet flan, caramel corn, and vivid spice succumb to a finish built for oak lovers, drying and a bit tannic, bringing the molten sweet flavors to an end too soon."
3313,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>M&H Elements Sherry Cask Israeli Single Malt, 46%<review>Using kosher-certified oloroso and Pedro Ximénez sherry casks, this Tel Avivian whisky evokes dried strawberry, plum pudding, and black cherry aromas, with strong peppercorn notes and a dusting of cocoa powder. With early red fruits and black cherry, this glides through milky coffee and chocolate pudding, buffeted by growing spices and a rasp of oak char, before a pleasant finish of baking chocolate and bourbon biscuits."
3314,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Spirit Works Straight Rye, 45%<review>Aged 2 years, 1 month in 53-gallon charred oak barrels, it's straight. So's the nose: green, herbal and oily with rye, and backed by oak. Mouth is honest: youthfully zesty rye flavors, grassy freshness, oak and alcohol warmth, and a savory rye finish. Nothing gets in the way of a pure experience. Good young rye."
3315,"<price>67<rating>83<whiskey>Glenrothes 2001 (bottled 2012), 43%<review>A typical Rothes nose, with vanilla, granola, apple, Brazil nut, lemon, and
low-level sweet spices mixing with lightly oxidized fruits. That said, it needs
water, especially for the palate, where the malty crispness of the undiluted
taste is replaced by something more considered, darkly fruity and gently spicy;
coriander is uppermost. All in all, this is Rothes in very approachable rather
than dynamic guise. One for a lazy afternoon."
3316,"<price>145<rating>89<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Körsbär, 47%<review>This rufescent whisky evokes aromas of cherry blossom, kirsch, white pepper, and wood spices. Light cherry syrup, caramel, and toffee, with a strident eruption of black pepper and clove that sets the underside of your tongue alight. Körsbär is Swedish for cherry and the fat red berry flavors leave a lovely warm glow inside. Despite its color, the sweet cherry wine finish has been judged to perfection. (SEK1198; Not available in the U.S.)"
3317,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Extended Stave Drying Time, 45%<review>Richer and fuller when compared to the Standard Stave Drying Time variant in this Experimental Collection. Sweeter too, with creamy layers of vanilla and caramel. The extended drying time influence tames the dried spice and oak resin and is proof that extended stave aging really benefits older bourbons that might otherwise be dominated by oak. Sadly, with whiskey in such demand, I doubt many bourbon producers will take the time to age the staves longer. Price per 375 ml."
3318,"<price>270<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park Odin 16 year old, 55.8%<review>Odin is the fourth and final release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection. It has been aged in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry casks and refill hogsheads, with the former predominating. The nose yields cocoa powder, insistent spice, subtle sweet smoke, heather honey, and rum-and-raisin fudge. Rich and fruity on the palate, with lively dark spices, plus treacle and peat smoke. The lingering finish initially offers smoky sherry, then dries with licorice and oak. (17,000 bottles)"
3319,"<price>61<rating>80<whiskey>Santis Edition Sigel, 40%<review>Why is it that so many great beer-producing European nations, many of them with Germanic roots, didn't progress to whisky making? Appenzeller brewery makes this malt using old beer casks, and they have softened the edges of the malt and given it a liquid honey frame around which woody-earthy notes and unripe dates create an intriguing mix. A long, long way from the Alps to the Scottish Highlands, but a lofty malt nevertheless.  €45 "
3320,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Roe & Co, 45%<review>Ahead of Diageo’s new Irish distillery opening in Dublin, this release has a bouquet of grilled orange, barley sugar, Conference pear, and vanilla cream laced with white pepper. The warm, fruity palate with soft barley sugars, poached pear, moderate spices, and tangy citrus becomes increasingly sweet, with vanilla dominating proceedings in the later phase. Easy to like, this makes me want to experiment and start mixing it up."
3321,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Glengoyne 21 year old, 43%<review>While younger Glengoyne whiskies are enjoyable but often fairly straight-forward in flavor, the older expressions develop nicely in depth. Regardless of age, there’s always a creamy maltiness as the foundation of the whisky. For this expression, notes of honey, cookie dough, dry spice notes (vanilla, cinnamon) and soft fruit (citrus, apple) round out the palate. This whisky is clean, polished, and very drinkable. A new addition to the Glengoyne line, and very welcome."
3322,"<price>57<rating>80<whiskey>Caol Ila Moch, 43%<review>Originally a one-off bottling for Friends of the Classic Malts, ‘Moch’ (Gaelic for dawn, though the association between daybreak and the dram is beyond me — one for the morning ‘skailk’ maybe?) appears to have taken the place of the Cask Strength expression. It shows a saline, seashell-like freshness, light smoke. and a pleasant mix of salami and grassiness. The palate is clean and intense with a continuation of that oyster liquor character. Great in a smoky Highball. £36"
3323,"<price>63<rating>81<whiskey>Hart Brothers (distilled at Glenturret), 10 year old, 1991 vintage, 53.6% ABV<review>Very fragrant and floral, with bright notes of citrus (lemons, orange) and fresh grass. Similar on the palate, with additional notes of soft honeyed malt and vanilla. Clean, fresh, appetizing finish. A nice aperitif or, better yet, a liquid sorbet between courses. 
"
3324,"<price>1250<rating>82<whiskey>The Dalmore 1974 Vintage, 42%<review>Beautiful complex fruit on the nose. Tannic grip on the palate -- especially on the finish. The tell-tale orange marmalade combines notes of orchard fruit, caramel apple, fried pineapple, banana nut bread, unsweetened chocolate, grape skin, and plain toast, peppered with cinnamon and ground espresso bean. Distinctive and evolving on the palate -- and humming along quite nicely -- until the oak turns a bit austere and aggressive on the finish. For this reason, it’s my least favorite of the range."
3325,"<price>155<rating>79<whiskey>Old Hobart Overeem Sherry Cask, 55%<review>The latest addition to Tasmania’s burgeoning and diverse whisky industry bottles for the first time in October 2011. This is just 4 years old, and while this isn’t Kavalan, the flavor is amazing: full and rich sherry, honeyed, intense, and fruity. The score reflects the fact that it’s well-made, yet way short of its optimum age. But wow — what a prospect this distillery is! AUD150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
3326,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection Kentucky Straight Malt Whiskey 8 year old, 54%<review>A rarity among the large American distillers: whiskey with a mashbill of 65% malted barley and 35% corn; no rye or wheat. The malted barley and corn dominate the flavor profile, along with soft sweet notes of orchard fruit and golden raisin, kissed with honey. The finish is soft, sweet, and quick. Clean, with an easy-going demeanor. Not particularly complex, however. If only the 35% corn was halved to include an equal amount of rye."
3327,"<price>220<rating>92<whiskey>Glenlivet 21 year old Archive, 43%<review>This expression is reputed to contain some whisky up to 40 years old and was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose offers overt sherry influences, with fruit malt loaf, maple syrup, honey, and old leather. Full and slightly oily on the rich palate, with toffee, raisins, Brazil nuts, and fresh cake mix. Dusty spices and oak in the relatively dry finish."
3328,"<price>86<rating>90<whiskey>Glann ar Mor NAS, 46%<review>French whisky encompasses a wide range of approaches and flavors, from the hugely aromatic P&M from Corsica to the understated Alsace whiskies of Elsass, Meyer’s, and Uberbach. There is a trio of whiskies from Brittany. Guy le Lat’s Eddu uses buckwheat to create a whisky that out-ryes rye. Distilerie Warengheim makes the most widely-seen whisky, Amorik. But for this writer the one to watch is Glann ar Mor (‘by the sea’), established in 2005 by Jean Donnay. A traditionalist approach: direct fire, wooden washbacks, wild yeast, and worm tubs yield a single malt whisky that, though barely over the 3 year legal limit, is already complex: think barley sugar and apricot. The fire and the worms give the mid-palate some real weight (boding well for longer-term maturation), but the slow distillation has added floral notes that dance on top. £55 "
3329,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Bellevoye White, 40%<review>A blend of three malts with a finish in sauternes barrels; the sweet wine gracing the whisky with a light, delicate frame. It takes a while to open up, unfurling flavors of brioche, egg custard, walnut baklava, ground cumin, and a conspicuous vanilla scent. Cinnamon commands the palate, supported by peach, nectarine, and vanilla, with a nuttiness and base notes of spice, rounding off with cinnamon, pepper, and baked orange."
3330,"<price>169<rating>91<whiskey>Buchanan’s Red Seal, 40%<review>Inhale deeply and this bestows a sense of serenity; morning dew on clipped lawns strewn with spent fireworks and strands of honey mingled with subtle, elegant smoke. Blender Maureen Robinson’s light, well-balanced creation ushers in gentle honey and growing sweetness, before billowing puffs of smoke grow dominant. Charred peaks of a lemon meringue pie, iced coffee, and milk chocolate follow, leaving a catch of smoke in the aftertaste. Quite a charmer."
3331,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Wild Turkey Longbranch, 43%<review>Redolent of marshmallow and vanilla, this is restrained on the nose, but revels in pretty sweetness, with peaches and cream, ripe banana, and circus peanuts candies. On the palate, this collaboration with actor Matthew McConaughey betrays some of its Wild Turkey pedigree, capturing the house earthiness. For its modest proof, it pours a bit hot on the palate, with plenty of oak tannins, making it a nice sipper on the rocks or with water. Value pick"
3332,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Baltimore Spirits Co. Epoch Rye (Batch 1), 50%<review>This is one for the oak fanatics. Wood and grain assert themselves right from the start, but the nose retains balance with aromas of butterscotch, fresh ginger, and herbs. The oak-forward palate shows pleasant flavors of cherry cough drop, dark chocolate, blackberries, red licorice, star anise, and ginger. Oak continues on the finish, which has nice length. Don’t be shy about adding water."
3333,"<price>45<rating>73<whiskey>Rogue Oregon Single Malt, 40%<review>Showing its youth through an obvious green character that peers from beneath a cloak of campfire and applewood smoke, with banana as the prominent fruit, along with secondary apple, citrus, and a peculiar rubber tire note. The palate is light-bodied and overtly sweet, with grass, marshmallow, and vanilla. Reminiscent of a Lowland malt, which only contributes to the disjointed feeling of the whole package."
3334,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Bourbon Cask, 40%<review>Compared to classic Grouse, this has more caramel notes, additional sweetness, and a greater delivery of lemon, vanilla, toasted coconut, and finely shredded orange peel. It’s lightly structured, drier, and comes with less-pronounced spices. Sipping reveals sweet light citrus, smooth caramel, vanilla sponge, apricot, soft fruits, and chocolate macaroon bars, with a late development of spice. Sweet caramel hangs on the lips. This is an easygoing, feel-good whisky."
3335,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Balblair 1997, 43%<review>Very fruity (peaches in syrup, pineapple, golden apple, sultana) and satisfyingly rich in texture, with coating vanilla, marzipan, and a potpourri of dried spice (especially on the nose and finish of the palate). Great balance too. Nicely done!"
3336,"<price>99<rating>86<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2016 Release), 55.9%<review>A batch of OESO 12 year old, OBSV 12 year old, and OESK 16 year old. Normally, Four Roses expresses a near-patented cinnamon note up front with fruity undertones. Not this time. Earth, oak, powerfully rich caramel, nutmeg, vanilla, barrel char, with slight hints of grain, corn syrup, and cardamom. Finally, the quintessential cinnamon shows over a slightly disappointing medium finish."
3337,"<price>50<rating>81<whiskey>Five & 20 (SB)2RW, 45%<review>The “(SB)2RW” stands for “small batch small barrel rye whiskey.” Smells like it: small barrel, fresh-cut oak smell, clove cigarettes, and a fair amount of heat. A bit thin on the tongue, with a medicinal bite of rye grass, warming heat, and some sweetness, and the medicinal part expands into the finish."

(52 bottles) £1,400"
3340,"<price>23<rating>85<whiskey>Jim Beam Pre-Prohibition Style Rye, 45%<review>The old Beam rye never got a lot of respect from aficionados. It’s been pulled, reformulated, and repackaged. Let’s try it. Smell: sweet grass and pepper. Taste: hot, flashy, sweet on top, with rye oiliness underneath, a tickling bitterness that blends well with oak into the finish. The higher proof plays well, giving this a punch of flavor the old yellow label didn’t have, and at a good price. It’s Manhattan time! Value Pick"

Sweet barley notes and vanilla are beaten up by coal tar, damp kiln smoke, and fiery spice on the finish. For those who like their Islay whiskies young. Very young. I would have waited a couple more years before bottling this one. Pure testosterone. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)

3342,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Green Spot, 40%<review>Roll out the red carpet, because Green Spot is coming to town. Baked apple, spiced sultanas, lush green lawns, and ripe green fruits greet the nose. It’s oily, smothering, and luxuriantly juicy, with a depth of character that tips over the back of the tongue like nectar. That mélange of light vanilla, butterscotch, and creamy rice pudding sprinkled with nutmeg is heavenly. If this doesn’t persuade you to fall in love with Irish pot still whiskey, then nothing will."
3343,"<price>78<rating>85<whiskey>A.D. Laws Four Grain Straight Bourbon Cask Strength (Barrel #48), 57%<review>An intense nose offers complexity with minty herbal notes, licorice, fresh-sawn oak, and peppery spice at the forefront, giving way to pithy orange peel on the palate. With a bit of water to subdue the punch, this becomes impressively smooth and fruity, revealing sandalwood aromas and offering a lovely, long finish of candied orange and sweet chocolate-covered cherries. 60% corn, 20% wheat, 10% rye, 10% barley."
3344,"<price>117<rating>81<whiskey>Darkness! (distilled at Invergordon) 23 year old, 50.8%<review>Cometh the night. Shadows veil a whisky hewn from the cold lands in the north. A whisky of black cherry, crème de prune, rancio, balsamic, and salt, for it has known a mythical chimera cask; half Pedro Ximénez, half oloroso wood. The magical, syrupy texture foretells of passion fruit, fig, cherry, and raisins, but prophesizes that cask char will dominate the swallow. Dark forces swamp the quest for grain, though there is taste, hope, and nourishment for the journey ahead. £77"
3345,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>Kirkland Signature Sour Mash, 40%<review>Lemon grove, bananas and cream, blackberry jam, coconut flakes, and brown sugar on the nose, with black tea and a chalky mineral back note. The palate is soft and round, with notes of whipped cream, cooked blueberries, gentle nuttiness, peppermint, and allspice. The finish is subtle in profile but has good length, offering pleasant spice, dark chocolate, red berries, and mellow oak. Balanced spice and lively fruit make for some pleasant sipping."
3346,"<price>52<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan 15 year old, 43%<review>Solid amber color. Flavors are seamless, silky smooth, and rich, with notes of dried fruit and flowers, toffee, subtle spices, and delicate nuts. A great after dinner malt, but universal enough to drink anytime."
3347,"<price>110<rating>90<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd 21 year old Perspective Series, 43%<review>The youngest in an excellent new range that combines small-batch blending by Doug McIvor with dramatic monochrome Scottish landscape photography by Lindsay Robertson, each image a visual metaphor for the whisky. Toffee, cherry, rich fruit, walnut, marmalade, vanilla essence, ripe banana, seasoned oak, and aromatic whole spices. The palate is charming and indulgent with rich fruitcake, banoffee pie, a good dose of spice, and a silky finish. £89

3348,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Fukano (2020 Edition), 40.6%<review>
A mercurial nose like many rice whiskies: pear, honeydew, chopped ginger, lemongrass, green herbal notes, wild garlic, white pepper, mineral elements, and seashells. Drawn from a combination of refill sherry, refill new oak, and one red wine cask, the aromas are matched by a dense palate of honey, herbal notes, melon, poached pear, ginger spice, lemongrass, pepper, vanilla, and lemon peel, with a tingly, spicy aftertaste. Definitely worth experiencing. (3,824 bottles)"
3349,"<price>127<rating>84<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at Glen Grant) 1992, 57.8%<review>The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing! £75"
3350,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Karuizawa cask 4592, 1977 (bottle 2010), ‘Noh Series,’ 60.7%<review>The (sadly mothballed) Karuizawa distillery is at the opposite extreme to Eigashima. Peated malt, small stills, and sherry casks give a single malt of uncompromising weight and solidity. Those of you who thought Japan was all about the ethereal and limpid, think again. In musical terms, if Eigashima is the Modern Jazz Quarter, then Karuizawa is late period Coltrane, or if you prefer, it’s Black Flag to Eigashima’s Carole King.
Anyhoo, did I mention this bottling (like all of this quartet from Number One Drinks) is green? Or at least has a color akin to tarnished silver? The note is all chicory and coffee, earthiness and cardamom - whisky reduced to some weird essence by long maturation. The effect is one of an old-fashioned cough medicine (with less laudanum).
The palate is explosive with masses of camphor, tar, licorice, and squid ink. This is Japanese whisky at its most extreme, and fainthearts should not venture here. Those with a taste for the big and the bold will love it, however. £130. Price in US dollars was converted at time of review."
3351,"<price>55<rating>82<whiskey>Wemyss The Peat Chimney 12 year old, 40%<review>The problem with selling your whisky by description is that if you don't deliver what you've claimed in the name, you're in trouble. That's a little bit how it was with these whiskies when they were seven years old. At this age, though, these are big boy whiskies and there is plenty of peat, seaweed, oil, barbecued fish, and salty sea notes to keep you hooked. Nicely balanced with fruit, too.  £35"
3352,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Kurayoshi 12 year old, 46%<review>This is airily fruity, with a greater emphasis on red fruits: strawberry jam, red apple, and red currant. With greater age, the five-spice and ground ginger are dialed up a couple of notches. A thick, jammy texture with flavors of red apple, malt, peppercorn, and chili flakes, glimpses of chocolate and cocoa, though the spices slacken with dilution. Finish of ground coffee, cooking chocolate, and fading spice. (2,160 bottles)"
3353,"<price>283<rating>91<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at BenRiach) 34 year old 1977 Vintage, 48.8%<review>Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180"
3354,"<price>160<rating>86<whiskey>A.D. Rattray 22 year old (distilled at Littlemill, Cask #558), 49.2%<review>A non-chill filtered, cask strength single malt from Littlemill, vintage 1991. Littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting, with butter toffee, milk chocolate, dried apricot, and straw. On the palate, these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. In the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. The finish is medium-length and slightly acidic, a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
3355,"<price>111<rating>85<whiskey>Darkness! (distilled at North British) 18 year old, 50.4%<review>This North British has been led astray; well, subjected to three months’ confinement in first-fill oloroso sherry wood. Such are the ways of Darkness! There’s a savory nose of peppered filet, mustard seed, and tarragon. Interesting, but not to everyone’s taste. The creamy texture consists of evaporated milk, strong caramel, dark toffee, and black currant granola, though that savory character persists. Water pumps up the cream, raspberry, and cereal notes until it sees daylight, becoming almost a breakfast whisky. £70"
3356,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Writers’ Tears Cask Strength (2019 Release), 53%<review>Good complexity here, with malt, toffee, clementine peel, creamy vanilla, flapjacks, peppercorn, and brown sugar sprinkled over baked apple and pear tarts. Beautiful flavors of sugared nuts, orange fondant cream, then wave after wave of intense spices. It’s wonderful neat, adding lush caramel, marmalade, and nutty flavors toward the end. This is twice as scarce as last year, so get your skates on. (2,580 bottles)"
3357,"<price>47<rating>82<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 105, 45%<review>Silky and sweet up front, with English toffee and lush, bright, honeyed fruit.  But similar to the “Rye 90” release, leather and oak resin dominate the back end of the palate through the finish. More balance is needed to warrant a higher rating. Price is per 375 ml."
3358,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Scotchdale 8 year old, 40%<review>The label of this distinctive blend of Highland and Speyside whiskies suggests it is designed for hotter and drier climates, and it works well in a variety of serves. Peach slices, pecan, peanut, cinnamon, nutmeg, grated milk chocolate, baked cookies, and toasted bakery aromas. It’s medium-bodied and eschews sweetness and fruitiness to inhabit a world of dark toffee, Brazil nut, dry oak, malt, plain chocolate, hot peppery spice, and licorice. (3,000 bottles)"
3359,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Forty Creek Unity, 43%<review>Fifteen years ago, Forty Creek used starboard (port-style wine) barrels to finish their legendary Portwood Reserve. The wine was emptied into fresh Forty Creek whisky barrels. Now, master blender Bill Ashburn has added back some of that original starboard to Forty Creek Unity. This lush, mouth-filling, butterscotch-sweet whisky bursts with red fruits, raisin tarts, hints of burnt toffee, and a restrained peppery glow."
3360,"<price>5000<rating>93<whiskey>Teeling 34 year old Vintage Reserve Single Malt, 40.9%<review>Sheer nectar, dripping with honeyed delights: baklava, maple syrup, syropiasta, vanilla spun sugar, malt wrapped in gentle oak, and a notion of Szechuan pepper. The mouthfeel is flowing and silken, radiating flavors of golden syrup, tangerine, peppercorn, vanilla, light oak, and nougat. As the flavor crests, the sweetness is evocative of Château D’Yquem. This decadent piece of Irish history originated as a Teeling family cask distilled in 1983. (U.S. exclusive, 43 bottles)"
3361,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Vinho Barrique, 60%<review>The Kavalan flag is unfurling fast. The whiskies are making it Stateside, and they're improving from a very high base. A couple of degrees stronger than previously, this is far richer than any wine cask-matured whisky has a right to be. This is huge, with a tropical nose of mango, melon, and papaya, and a hint of dustiness. The palate is astounding. Rich, sweet, and rounded, it coats the mouth with an intense mixture tempered by burnt toffee and cocoa. Stunning."
3362,"<price>25<rating>81<whiskey>Concannon, 40%<review>An Irish blend matured in used bourbon barrels and finished in Concannon Petite Sirah wine barrels. Very clean and fresh, with mouth-coating honeyed malt, vanilla, tropical fruit, and golden raisin. Fleeting, light oak finish. My only issue with this whiskey is that it tastes young. I would like to see another four to five years of aging (in bourbon casks, not Sirah) for this whiskey to really develop. (Available only in the U.S.)"
3363,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Amrut, Limited Edition, Peated, (bottled 2008), 62.78%<review>Good balance between ripe barley, rum-like sweetness, and damp kiln smoke. Dried oak spice, bourbon char, brine, and anise add complexity, peaking on the finish. An interesting contrast to the other Amrut whiskies. This whisky could pass for a youthful Islay malt."
3364,"<price>12<rating>73<whiskey>Catch Fire Cinnamon, 30%<review>Cinnamon is reputed to have medicinal qualities, but you can bet those who drink Catch Fire Cinnamon do so for the incinerating jolt of sweet, spicy heat. Cinnamon hearts and hints of grain dust, almost like those cinnamon sticks in Christmas punch. Sweet, but not cloying. A creamy mouthfeel and touch of whisky wood remind us, if vaguely, that Catch Fire is whisky. The Lynne Truss of flavored whiskies: shoots, winces, and leaves with a long glowing finish."

The overall impression on the olfactory system is gentle and mild. A tasty prospect, with poached pear, vanilla ice cream, honeydew, peppery spices, ground almond, custard tarts, lemon zest, malt, and peanut brittle. A little tangy citrus, deep warmth, and vanilla to finish. Rather moreish. (480 bottles)"

Partaking unshackles gingerbread, treacle, clove, black coffee, black fruits, and plain chocolate. Dark, gothic whiskey from a shadowy part of the warehouse to devour at midnight.

The nose is sweetly spiced and subtly smoky, with Lapsang souchong tea, kelp, beach bonfire, cigar box, orange peel, cinnamon, white pepper, and crème brûlée. Sharply herbal at first taste, it warms up to reveal orange oil, cherry cola, cough syrup, cigar wrapper, iced tea, roasted walnuts, caramel, and savory smoke. Chili heat on the finish is balanced by oak, dark chocolate, tobacco, and grilled apple."

The nose is sweet, with apricots, vanilla, ginger, white pepper, ozone, and antiseptic cream, plus insistent smoky peat. Orchard fruits on the palate, with big earthy smoke notes, vanilla, and coconut. The finish is long, with licorice, black pepper, rock salt, and drying peat."
3369,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Tomatin 15 year old Moscatel Limited Edition, 46%<review>Distilled in 2003, this expression spent a decade maturing in bourbon barrels before a further 5 years in first-fill Portuguese moscatel wine barriques. It was bottled without chill-filtration. The nose offers fragrant spices and red apples sprinkled lightly with white pepper. Very fruity on the supple palate, with strawberries-and-cream notes, background citrus, almonds, and slightly musty oak. Black pepper and figs in the medium-length finish."

Oily in the mouth, it’s drying without water, highlighting salinity, smoke, cigar wrapper, lemon oil, and Jordan almonds. With water, lemon, vanilla taffy, and mouth-puckering saline; the smoke is less overt. It finishes clean, sweet, and simple, with grilled lemon and lingering smoke. (298 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"

Long, spicy finish.  A nice way to finish a rich, hearty meal, perhaps? "
3372,"<price>140<rating>87<whiskey>Bruichladdich PC6, 61.6%<review>This is six year old, 40 ppm phenol (very smoky) whisky distilled at Bruichladdich, bottled at cask strength and enhanced in Madeira casks. A young whisky, but mature enough to say that it’s not too young. The immediate impact is damp peat smoke and smoldering charcoal. If you are patient and observant enough (and with an addition of water), you’ll coax notes of vanilla, berried fruit, pear, green apple, and underlying spice (fresh mint, anise), all leading to a briny, smoldering smoke finish. A cult whisky for those who like to push the envelope. When compared to its predecessor, PC5, PC6 is slightly darker in color, creamier, fruitier, and a shade softer. Given this, I still prefer the PC5 over the PC6 for its clarity and innocence."

This powerful expression, predominantly matured in bourbon with some sherry casks, has an intriguing nose of candied peel, dried apricot, mango strips, white pepper, herbal notes, almond paste, and sweet grapefruit flesh. Thick and velvety, there’s warm marmalade, sugared almonds, golden barley, citrus, green apple, and acrobatic spices. A superb introduction to this quintessential Irish whiskey style.

The nose is rich and inviting, with apricots in syrup, marzipan, caramel, and new-mown hay. Voluptuous in the mouth, with tangy fruits, barley sugar, cinnamon, sherry, and ultimately coffee grounds. An oaky finish with cocoa powder, white pepper, and lemon juice."
3375,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>Chivas, 18 year old, 40%<review>An essay in balance on both the aroma and palate. Silky layers of delicate sweetness (honeyed vanilla, caramel, light toffee) permeate through clean, delicate fruit (citrus, peach, currant), and subtle, complex dried spice. Clean finish, with a hint of dark chocolate. A very versatile, very drinkable blend which suits most moods and occasions. Indeed, a benchmark blended scotch.

The nose presents memories of long-closed whisky warehouses, old books, and artist’s oil paint. Prunes, dates, figs, chocolate-covered cherries, a cobbler’s shop, vague cloves, lilacs, brown sugar, and warming spices on the palate. Ultra-complex, rich, creamy, and fruity. Hot and mouth-watering with billows of vanilla, creamy caramel, and mincemeat. (1,200 bottles for the U.S. and Canada only) Collectible"
3377,"<price>161<rating>84<whiskey>Komogatake The Revival 2011, 57%<review>Aged in a mix of sherry and American oak casks, this is the latest work in progress from the reopened Mars distillery. The nose is a little closed, with some light oak, a touch of smoke, some fresh barley, and light fruit over the sweet core typical of the distillery. Just a touch of plastic, indicative of youth. The palate is immediate, and bursting with sweetness, exotic fruits, and clean acidity. Welcome back, Mars! £110"
3378,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Nikka Coffey Grain, 45%<review>Sweet, with subtle, crisp, nutty oak, then comes fudge, ripe banana, and peach. The overall effect is like eating vanilla ice cream with toffee fudge and hazelnut sprinkles. The structure is thick and physical, the palate sweet and quite fat, with light hints of raspberry, fruit salad. A jag of acidity freshens the delivery on the finish. With water there’s more toffee, and it becomes slightly more yielding, with less oak. For me the gold standard of grain."
3379,"<price>108<rating>91<whiskey>Shelter Distilling Embers Peated (Barrel No. 33), 46%<review>

The sweet, mineral, herbal smoke of this whiskey is a rare treat, calling up memories of the shells of grilled oysters, smudging a bundle of sage, and lightly charring marshmallows over a campfire. Subtly smoky on the palate, well-woven with sweet confectionary notes of meringue, candy cigarettes, and powdered dried lemon zest. It finishes mild and still sweet, vanilla and coconut on the final breath. Curious, unique, and delightful."
3380,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Bernheim Original Kentucky Straight Wheat Whiskey, 45%<review>Gentle in personality and predominantly sweet, with notes of honeyed vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, coconut cream pie, and a hint of red licorice. Underlying bright fruit, suggestions of green tea, and a dusting of cinnamon keep the whiskey lively and upbeat. A soft, toasted oak finish tames the sweetness and provides balance. The whiskey is more approachable and easier to drink than a typical bourbon containing rye-the spicy rye intensity isn’t there. Some bourbon enthusiasts will miss the challenge-and rewards-that the rye would normally provide. For this reason, this whiskey will be more appealing to drinkers of wheated bourbons (e.g., Maker’s Mark, Old Fitzgerald, W.L. Weller). It is an interesting change of pace from the standard bourbon fare, and it is a unique exploration of American whiskey without sacrificing authenticity.

3381,"<price>661<rating>88<whiskey>Balvenie 2009 vintage, 64.6%<review>This was aged in new American oak and selected for its faint smokiness, believed to have been picked up from a previous peated spirit run. Pears, white pepper, and faint cigarette smoke on the nose. Full-bodied, with lots of tropical fruit, vanilla, honey, and a slightly antiseptic note. Long and peppery in the finish, with more medicinal flavor. £500"

It’s silky and light-bodied in the mouth, with a heaping slab of dry oak, peanut shells, walnuts, pepper, cacao nibs, and orange peel. The oak persists on the finish, which is a bit abrupt."
3383,"<price>536<rating>91<whiskey>Craigellachie 23 year old, 46%<review>Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). Now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured, layered, long, and elegant. £337"
3384,"<price>13<rating>78<whiskey>Mellow Corn Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Used cooperage and higher corn content make corn whiskey its own category, and Mellow Corn is its leader. As expected, corn dominates throughout as salty chip, tortilla, and my favorite, a thick corn pudding. Burnt brown sugar, vanilla, and black pepper spice tingle the senses, too. This is a sipper if you really like corn, but you can’t drink this and think bourbon."
3385,"<price>104<rating>85<whiskey>Navazos Palazzi Malt Bota Punta, 52.5%<review>Red apple, dried fig, clove, baked ham, and plums boiled in sugar in this warm, fragrant, and aromatic whisky made with Spanish malt. The complexity of the nose is not sustained, as the spice characters dominate the palate after the initial few seconds. Baked orange, verging on tropical fruits, is overthrown by the black pepper and clove welling up from the underside of the tongue, leaving a bitter chicory aftertaste. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
3386,"<price>320<rating>92<whiskey>Macallan 18 year old Sherry Oak (2018 Edition), 43%<review>Like previous releases, this was matured in sherry-seasoned oak casks.

Honey, apple blossom, ginger, and nutmeg on the nose, which then exhibits damp tweed, and finally, hot butter. Sweet on the full palate, with milk chocolate, honey, ripe peaches, almonds, vanilla, and caramel. Quite long in the finish, with zesty apple notes."
3388,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>Egan’s Vintage Grain, 46%<review>From vintage 2009, this bourbon cask matured whiskey is around the 8 year mark. Vanilla custard tarts, digestive biscuits, green vegetal notes, and scents of a bakery counter pull you in. Caramel, active spices, soft fruits, peach, apple, pear, pepper, and golden sultana flavors, but as the caramels slide into toffee the grain character becomes more evident into the finish."
3389,"<price>44<rating>85<whiskey>Leopold Bros. Maryland Style Rye, 43%<review>Maryland, Monongahela, and, I guess, Modern are the American rye styles. Maryland was a gentler rye, less spicy, and not as hot/sweet as modern rye. This has the dry-grass spice of rye, a hint of cocoa powder, and a bit of funk that blows away to hints of fruit. Light and clean on the palate, some sweetness that rapidly dries out in a grassy, herbal wave. Intriguing, without being overwhelming."
3390,"<price>54<rating>87<whiskey>Deerhammer American Single Malt, 46%<review>This porter-style, 100% malted barley single malt has a nose of dark chocolate and coffee beans that’s also slightly herbal, with a note of wood and a subtle, pleasant sweetness. Toasted oak leads on the palate, with sugared espresso, cinnamon, dried flowers, and an ashy back note. More coffee, chocolate, and coconut punctuate the finish. Aged at least 2 years, this whiskey is surprisingly complex considering its relative youth, and is quite unique."

It includes a 14% grain content from Caledonian 1974, Carsebridge 1970, Girvan 1974, Invergordon 1972, Lochside 1966, North of Scotland 1974, and Port Dundas 1973. An elegant, refined mélange of peach, pear, soft oak, and rose cream florals, with dark fruit, chocolate, and fine pepper. Outstanding."
3392,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Nuts about Pears 1991 (distilled at Blair Athol), 46%<review>From Wemyss Malts’ Midsummer Single Cask Releases, this bottling from Blair Athol was distilled in 1991 and bottled in 2015. Soft, sweet fruits as the nose opens—principally juicy pears. This is backed up by malt and cinnamon. Very smooth and inviting on the palate, with honey, brittle toffee, gentle spices, darker malt, and walnuts. Slightly mouth-drying in the finish, with cocoa powder and lingering spice. (312 bottles) £115"
3393,"<price>48<rating>93<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>I really enjoy these older Eagle Rare whiskeys. They’re big, hearty whiskies that are very traditional in style, but have extra depth on the palate due to the extensive aging. Sweet notes (candy corn and toffee) meld nicely with underlying nuttiness (pecans, almonds), delicate spice (vanilla, cinnamon, mint), and a hint of leather. One of the best Eagle Rares I have ever tasted."
3394,"<price>175<rating>93<whiskey>Canadian Club, 30 year old, 40%<review>Bottled to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Canadian Club whisky. An amazingly fresh and vibrant whisky given its age and delicateness. I feared that, given how light in body traditional Canadian whiskies are, this whisky would be old, tired, and show too much oak (which was true for Crown Royal’s ultra-premium offering, XR). But this isn’t the case. There’s an excellent balance of silky caramel, vanilla icing, dried spice (cinnamon, spearmint), and berried fruit, along with more subtle notes of toffee apple, corn oil, and soft dried oak on the finish. Not as luxurious as Crown Royal’s Cask No. 16, but it shines with its polish and purity. 
"
3395,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>Old Elk Straight Wheat Whiskey, 50%<review>Made with 95% soft red winter wheat, this whiskey is reticent at first, giving up little of its personality, though there are glimpses of violet, dried rose petals, berries, and oranges on the nose. The palate has more dried flowers and a bit of fruit, along with oak, nuts, and dark chocolate, but a peculiar herbal, piney top note elbows its way to the front. Everything resolves on the finish with semi-dark chocolate, pepper, dark fruit, and oak."
3396,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>The English Smokey, 43%<review>This lives up to its name with leaf bonfire smoke, vanilla essence, and ginger preserves. Distiller David Fitt chooses malt peated to the same level as Port Ellen maltings delivers to Laphroaig. Assertive flavors of raw ginger, peppercorn, and chili flakes succumb to soothing vanilla cream and herbal notes. It leaves a creaminess on the lips and a mouth-coating finish of bonfire smoke and ground pepper. (480 bottles)"
3397,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Canadian Club Dock No. 57 Spiced, 40%<review>A judicious infusion of vanilla and spice bolsters cinnamon, pepper, caramel, and aged oak, while leaving the rye whisky character intact. Prune juice tinged with citrus fruit balances sour black licorice and earthy artist’s canvas. The palate has a creaminess, but with pithy, silky tannins. Burning hot cinnamon hearts and syrupy sweetness take us vaguely into liqueur territory. A complex nose, but a simple palate that soon fades into white grapefruit and a warming peppery glow. (Canada only) C$26"
3398,"<price>35<rating>79<whiskey>Templeton Small Batch Rye, Batch #2, Barrel #173, 40%<review>The labeling is a little confusing. Small batch implies a marriage of multiple barrels, not just a bottling from a single barrel; the label seems to imply both. Plus, there’s no indication of the source of this whiskey, or its age. Regardless, this is one of the sweetest and mellowest rye whiskeys I’ve tasted. Spicy fresh mint, cinnamon, white pepper, and subtle clove are tamed by sweet notes of toasted marshmallow, cotton candy, creamy vanilla, candied fruit, and red licorice. Soft finish. Rather gentle for a rye whiskey."
3399,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Devils River Small Batch Texas Bourbon, 45%<review>The nose begins with lemon and lime, followed by notes of licorice root and dill. The palate is smoother and sweeter, if a bit light, with notes of cherry, chocolate, cinnamon, and new oak. The addition of water reveals flavors of orange pekoe tea, peanut shells, a richer note of chocolate, and a dusting of chili powder. Some barrel influence on the palate, but the finish concludes with chocolate, sassafras, and bitter almond oil."
3400,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Laphroaig 10 year old Cask Strength (Batch 010), 58%<review>A turbocharged version of the formidable standard 10 year old, Cask Strength varies in ABV from batch to batch. Tar and antiseptic hit the nose immediately, along with peat smoke, malt, newsprint, and new leather. There’s also lemon, vanilla, and brine. The sinewy palate mirrors the nose, adding charcuterie and cocoa powder. Predictably medicinal and phenolic in the very long finish, with balancing sweet malt."
3401,"<price>88<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Scotia 16 year old, 46%<review>The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!"
3402,"<price>122<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at North British) 27 year old 1988, 50.2%<review>Drawn from a single refill barrel, the nose is like a day in the life of a honeybee: streams of pollen, rich nectar, heady scents of flying over bright summer flowers and summer picnics of white peaches and lemonade before returning to the hive to the sweet, sticky honey. It’s quite a buzz! There’s an acidic palate of lemon juice, lime, honey, and lemon pith bordering on bitterness. The finish is incredibly dry, like someone just invented lemon-scented sandpaper. (168 bottles) £85"
3403,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky, 10 year old, 40%<review>For the past few years, Famous Grouse vintage vatted malt has been produced but not sold here in the U.S. They were in the 10-12 year old age range. This version being introduced to the U.S. is a non-vintage expression, and I don’t think it really matters. What matters is its taste. Major components of The Famous Grouse blended whiskies have included The Macallan and Highland Park, and there’s no doubt these malts are providing some of the richness and flavor complexity in this new expression. The whisky is quite hefty, with notes of juicy fruit, toffee, almonds, heather, and a wisp of vanilla and smoke. It is also very well balanced and quite a bargain for $30.

3404,"<price>20<rating>80<whiskey>Alberta Premium, 40%<review>When high-rye whisky seemed doomed, some hard-bit fans longed to taste a simple mixer called Alberta Premium. With few ryes to compare, reviewers assessed this all-rye grain whisky generously. Today, with rye whisky booming and rye’s flavor diversity understood, opinions are more informed. Enjoy the caramels, mild wood, light peppery rye spices, and ginger of this old-style 100% rye by a campfire or in a Highball. (Canada only) $27 CAD"
3405,"<price>62<rating>86<whiskey>The Balvenie Golden Cask 14 year old, 47.5%<review>Gold color (as its name suggests) with a hint of copper. This whisky, which was finished in Caribbean rum casks, follows on the heels of the limited edition The Balvenie 17 year old Rum Cask. The 17 year old was pleasant enough, but quite sweet (I rated it an 80). This new Golden Cask is an improvement, because the higher alcohol level, along with an array of dried spice, helps to balance the sweet rum notes. Lively, bright tangerine, nectarine, and pineapple combine with Balvenie’s signature honey, nougat, Heath bar, light molasses, and milk chocolate. Dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) and gritty oak resin kick in on the finish, rounding everything out quite nicely. Now if we could only have the best of both worlds -- the balance of the Golden Cask 14 year old, and the maturity of the 17 year old. That could be a whisky worthy of a 90s rating. (Travel Retail Exclusive) Price per liter."
3406,"<price>28<rating>79<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Battle Cry, 40%<review>Craft beer whiskey: mashbill of 80% malt/20% rye malt, fermented with a Belgian ale yeast that yields spicy aromas. Nose is mostly young oak, like a small barrel whiskey, but there are some subtle spice notes and sweet malt. Creamy mouth, sweet but not sticky, and the orange and spice I’m picking up are likely from that yeast. Body is luscious; best part of the whiskey, because the finish turns prickly. There’s promise here, but delivery’s delayed. Price is per 375 ml."
3407,"<price>47<rating>91<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 125, 45%<review>Complex and robust, with the biggest body of the group here. Very spicy (brisk clove, evergreen, warming cinnamon), but a solid sweet underbelly of toffee, caramel, and vanilla balances it. Its dry spicy finish makes a bold statement, without crossing the line. Very nice! Price is per 375 ml."
3408,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>West Cork Black Reserve, 43%<review>The double-charred, first-fill bourbon casks deliver Madagascan vanilla paste, dark-roast cocoa beans, caramelized sugars, and a wedge of pecan pie. Heightened vanilla flavors, maple syrup, a little chocolate, coffee grains, sweet char, and those dark, sticky, softening pecans prized from the pie. Alternately sucking on vanilla pods and chewing leather bootstraps describes the finish. A one-trick pony, some might say, but it’s a highly distinctive and impressive steed all the same. (4,800 bottles)"
3409,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Buchanan’s Special Reserve 18 year old, 40%<review>This blend has style. Coils of red apple peel, ripe orange, cherry blossom florals, freshly split oak, and dry, gentle spices, like running a wet finger around an old spice jar. It’s juicy and thick, with festive satsumas, some bright sharpness, and acidic citrus overcome by juicy sweetness, marmalade flavors, and walnut. The refined finish has a tangle of spice, orange peel, honey, and just a whiff of struck match."
3410,"<price>23<rating>85<whiskey>J&B Rare, 40%<review>Justerini & Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light, Speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, Bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds.

3411,"<price>63<rating>80<whiskey>BenRiach 12 year old, 46%<review>Clean, fresh and uncomplicated. Honeyed malt, peaches and cream, with subtle floral and lime notes. Dry, herbal, oaky finish with a hint of bitter chocolate. A warm-weather whisky, or as an aperitif."
3412,"<price>50<rating>71<whiskey>Wieser Wiesky Pinot Noir 7 year old, 40%<review>The wine cask anoints a gentle amber hue to this natural-colored whisky that has a nose redolent of wine gums. It has a firm texture with early promises of apple and blackberry, but then the flavors tumble off a cliff; a mouth-puckering bedlam of unsweetened rhubarb, cough medicine, licorice, and aniseed. A dash of water extinguishes many of the sour notes, but any redeeming qualities are weakened too, leaving it bland and saggy. Hard to love this one."

Perfumed on the nose, with fresh-cut flowers, canned peaches in syrup, butterscotch, and white chocolate. More canned peaches, orange peel, apple crumble, hazelnuts, and heather honey on the palate. The finish is long and peppery. Remarkably vibrant for its age. (363 bottles, 38 for U.S.)"
3414,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Barrel Finish Rye 2017 Release, 55.5%<review>At first, it’s truly American candy: melted chocolate-covered almonds and coconut. Then, it’s cinnamon, toffee, butterscotch, gingersnap cookies, red pepper, and Rice Krispies. This mouth-coating offers lingering baking spices throughout. A drop of water offers even more complexity, with pronounced caramel chew notes developing. With or without water, a complex and long finish awaits with hints of jalapeño chocolate."
3415,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Chicken Cock Bootlegger’s Reserve, 45%<review>This blend of bourbon and rye offers quince, kiwi, jasmine, honey, vanilla, angel food cake, sultanas, and lemon meringue on the nose. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward, but offers coconut, banana flan, maple syrup, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and lemon, with an appealing char note. The finish is gently spicy, smooth, and light, ending with sweet vanilla and soft oak. Perhaps a bit closed at times, and lacks some cohesiveness, but it’s very easy to enjoy."
3416,"<price>64<rating>79<whiskey>Dublin in the Rare Auld Times 10 year old, 40%<review>A 10 year old single malt whiskey bottled for Pete St. John by Glendalough musters a low-key olfactory range with reference points of malted barley, sawn oak, and soft fudge. A woozy haze of toffee buttercream, vanilla, and clotted cream hang on a light structure. The flavor has limited room to maneuver, roaming around a palate of sponge cake, fudge fingers, and ginger snaps before it putters out with a dry, fleeting finish. €60"

Apple, pear, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, and ground almond mingle with velvety smooth caramels. An impressive Dublin-distilled pot still debut from Teeling, with its diverse cask mix for the 1:1 ratio of unmalted and malted barley to develop texture and complexity. (6,000 bottles for U.S.)"
3418,"<price>10<rating>76<whiskey>Maple Mist, 35%<review>Warm maple, caramel, and salt in the nose, like caramels being melted for making cookies (something my wife does every Christmas).

Pleasantly sweet at first in flavor, with notes of brown sugar and spice (vanilla, mint), becoming dry with enveloping flavors of oak and leather. With a little water, more subtle flavors are revealed, including toffee, dark fruit, and anise. The whisky finishes long and dry with significant depth. This is a big exciting bourbon, full of character from the distillery previously known as Ancient Age. The price is right too-if you can find the whiskey to buy it."
3420,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Catskill Fearless Wheat, 42.5%<review>Sharp nose of fresh, wet grain, hot honey, a little butterscotch, crushed boxwood leaves, and a touch of linseed; an herbal smell. Mouth is roundly sweet, with honey and pie crust notes that meet the oak and pretty it up. There’s mint here, which surprised me; maybe from the wood? This one’s dainty, delicate, and maybe a bit too sweet, but it maintains an edge of oak that keeps it serious. Price is per 375 ml."
3421,"<price>1900<rating>93<whiskey>Highland Park 40 year old, 48.3%<review>Antique copper color, with some streaks of gold. A complex array of dried fruit on the nose, peppered with dried spice, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and wood shavings. On the palate, the immediate impact is once again marmalade, followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate, wood shavings, anise, and subtle smoke emerge. Dry and spicy on the finish, but never austere. A delicious, contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully.

This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity, I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). This whisky is in the same league as the others. Its only down side is that it’s a lot more expensive than the others."
3422,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Kentucky Straight (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2020), 64.5%<review>
The nose has vanilla galore, along with nuts, milk chocolate, cooked cherries, orange oil, cinnamon, and iced tea; water highlights the grain to great effect. Chewy and textured in the mouth, with plenty of chocolate, peanuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground ginger, and cayenne pepper, plus lively orange zest. It finishes lengthy and satisfying: dark chocolate and that orange zest integrating seamlessly with cinnamon, brown sugar, and polished oak."
3423,"<price>415<rating>90<whiskey>Tomintoul 25 year old, 43%<review>This is the oldest core expression of Tomintoul’s Gentle Dram, now available in the U.S. It is a classic of this style of Speyside single malt. Peaches, malt, honey, vanilla, and developing floral notes on the nose. Full-bodied, with ripe apples, cocoa, milky coffee, honey, vanilla, and soft spices. Spicy and drying, with plain chocolate in the relatively lengthy, mellow finish."
3424,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Dark Cove Committee Edition, 55%<review>This is the bigger, spicier, and more complex of the pair (see below). A prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke, pink and Szechuan peppercorns, vanilla, dark chocolate, angelica, then seaweed. The palate is oily, with a detonation of gunpowdery peat, licorice, smoked eel, and a feral edge that adds grunt. Layered and complex."
3425,"<price>80<rating>82<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach) 15 year old, 43%<review>Another catch-up from G&M, this time from the ‘Beast of Dufftown.’ Immediate substance and solidity, which is what you want from Mortlach, but there’s also thick-cut marmalade and cumin. Only with water, however, does the classic meatiness emerge—like a lamb tangine with apricot. A cleaner, slightly lighter side to the Flora & Fauna 16 year old, but with heft and a burnt licorice sweetness. A great introduction to a classic distillery."
3426,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Nikka from the Barrel, 51.4%<review>Wonderful to see this portly bottle in U.S. stores at last. An exotic nose, with turned woods, stewed plum, sultana, ground ginger, dried chilies, and black cherry, it oscillates between spice and dark fruits. Rich smoke is packed deep; it’s far from the most dominant aroma. Orange, cherry, mango, and bubble gum  notes are beaten back by a spicy rush of ginger and pepper, the sweetness prevailing over the cloves. Editors' Choice"
3427,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>Classic Cask 23 year old Port Pipe, 43%<review>Maraschino cherries, red currant, oak bark, and wet slate on the nose after 6 months of finishing. Light, clean opening with cherry and strawberry; a little fig and raisin bring depth. Hints of clove and aniseed dart about, then more oak swells up, though the red fruity sweetness stays in control. A smooth finish of fruit chews, with those spices burning brightly deep in the back of the throat. (769 bottles)"
3428,"<price>85<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box, Flaming Heart, Batch #2, 48.9%<review>Balanced Islay whiskies combine peat smoke characteristics with a sweet foundation. They’re not one-dimensionally smoky. This whisky is an excellent example. This is a peat-laden whisky with refinement and grace. Creamy vanilla, caramel, and honey harmoniously marry with persistent -- yet controlled -- peat smoke. Crisp spice notes and dancing fruit throughout adds complexity. Well done."
3429,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Basil Hayden’s Two by Two Rye, 40%<review>Bright, delicate, and approachable. While not a showstopper, it delivers generous sweet fruit, almost candied red apple sweetness, along with floral and black cherry notes. On the palate, it shows modest structure, with notes of lemon and pistachio, along with gentle wisps of baking spice and sandalwood. A blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbons."
3430,"<price>26<rating>89<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2001 Vintage (Barrel #1), 43.3%<review>While last year’s vintage was a more delicate expression of Evan Williams, I loved it for its elegance, charm, and balance (and gave it a 95 rating). This one is darker in flavor and bolder, with more caramelized sugars (caramel, toffee, maple syrup) along with some underlying fruit. It’s also drier, spicier, and with more wood influence (resin and polished leather). It still maintains its balance on the nose and majority of the palate, but with more wood on the finish than I would prefer to rate it in the 90s. (One more thing to consider: it’s a single barrel bottling and no two barrels are alike.) Value Pick"
3431,"<price>888<rating>82<whiskey>The Notch, 44.4%<review>Soft, gentle aroma, with notes of vanilla wafers, marzipan, and bramble. Continued soft, sweet, and creamy on the palate, with red and black currant, pear, subtle gin botanicals, and lingering anise on the finish. Good oak grit for such a young whisky, which helps to balance the sweetness. Fairly straightforward, as would be expected with such youthfulness, but very enjoyable. I wonder if this whisky is peaking at eight years old (or at least reached a plateau)? Certainly mature enough to enjoy now, but I would be curious to see this at 12 years old, where it might gain some additional depth and complexity, providing the oak is kept in check.

3432,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park Valknut, 46.8%<review>This follows Valkyrie in the Viking Legend series. Distilled using a proportion of Tartan barley grown on Orkney, which is said to produce additional smokiness. Matured mainly in sherry-seasoned American oak casks. Smoldering wood embers on the early nose, with heather in bloom and apple blossom. Vanilla, cloves, and smoky citrus fruit on the palate. The finish yields peat, aniseed, and nutmeg."
3433,"<price>12<rating>77<whiskey>Hayes Parker Reserve Original, 45%<review>From TerrePure; there’s that reassuring note on the label that the whiskey is “Aged at least six months.” Nose is somewhat flat, compressed; diner mints, old cinnamon sticks, cattle feed. Tastes thin, sweet, hot, and not very complex. There’s a flash of something more just before the swallow: corn, hot mint. But it vanishes in a bland, quick finish. Uninspiring, if surprisingly smooth for 6 month old whiskey."
3434,"<price>38<rating>88<whiskey>Jane Walker, 41.9%<review>Unlike the Jane Walker package for Johnnie Walker Black Label released in 2018, this is a new whisky altogether, a blend of various malts aged at least 10 years, including Cardhu and Clynelish. The nose is floral and gently nutty, with rose water, salted almonds, green apple, nougat, and caramel chews. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth, it has bright flavors of lime, lemon, vanilla, and coconut, before edging into nutty milk chocolate and finishing with good length, and a final savory note.

3435,"<price>102<rating>80<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Rhubarb Royale (distilled at Benrinnes) 2001, 46%<review>Here is Benrinnes in very summery guise, with its signature meatiness barely discernible. Instead you get lots of thyme, rosemary, and dried citrus peel. The palate is clean and concentrated, with a tart drive akin to red currant. It is this jangly effect which shows the need for dilution. Water does improve things, and while the sour fruits are still there, the effect is more calm. It does lack length though. £65"
3436,"<price>140<rating>95<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch Straight (2019 Release), 56.3%<review>From first sniff, it’s clear this is mature and stately stuff. It’s quite oak-driven, but rather than purely primary wood, it smells of fine leather, cedar chest, polished handrails, and barrel warehouse. Beneath the woody splendor lurks a core of rich black cherry fruit, which permeates the full-bodied palate, oozing with dark berry fruit that slowly succumbs to butterscotch, espresso, chocolate-covered cherries, and drying tannins. A masterful work of balance and lush flavors. Collectibles"
3437,"<price>140<rating>85<whiskey>Glengarioch, 1979 Vintage, Cask #6489, 52.1%<review>(A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive). Shimmering gold color. Lovely creamy texture. This creaminess comes through in its flavors too, binding to notes of vanilla, malt, shortbread, and delicate honey. Floral notes, citrus, red currants, and a wisp of peat provide contrast. An enjoyable, nicely polished dram from a distillery whose whisky is underappreciated-especially the older expressions.

3438,"<price>68<rating>90<whiskey>Pike Creek 21 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask-Finished, 45%<review>Aromas of old books, ether, raspberries, and caramel, with some sharpness and muddiness. Sweet and malty, with maraschino cherries, it then develops a hot and vaguely bitter-sweetness, some dry barrel notes, mild spices, bananas, and shoe polish. The finish is slightly sweet and mildly fruity with a fleeting bitterness, some barrel notes, and pleasant, burning peppery spice. Not as lush as past releases or as tightly integrated. $90 CAD"
3439,"<price>90<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Slyrs) 3 year old, 52.5%<review>White pepper-dappled summer fruits on the nose, with squishy overripe melon, banana peel, zesty lime, dried grasses, and clove, with a slightly rubberized note like BMX handlebar grips. This young Bavarian single malt has a rich, syrupy texture and tastes of sour fruits, bitter orange peel, and barley, shifting to creamy caramel and peppery spices. Finish of caramel, peppercorn, and peach pit. Not bad at all. (691 bottles)"
3440,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Millstone Peated, 40%<review>Van Zuidam distillery’s star has risen rapidly — it’s under ten years old —and its single malt and rye are confident forays into the world of whisky. So is this. This is 5 ½ years old and is a distinctly different take on peat, with little acerbity, oil smoke, or charcoal. A softer spiciness is present — it’s an almost ginger cake quality, with menthol and lemon-lime candy in the mix. €55 (Not available in the U.S.)"
3441,"<price>24<rating>79<whiskey>Darby's Reserve Rye, 45%<review>Sharp, bitterly vegetal, reminiscent of crushed turnip or radish; sweet oaky caramel in the background. Building block flavors—oak, rye oil, more turnip, sweet cereal—not well integrated. As if a very tight-cut new make had been put in a barrel and rolled and heated continuously for a short period of time (with some turnips). Finish is initially sweet, then closes with a bitter note. Turnip dissipates as it airs, but the memory lingers. Sourced whiskey. (Total Wine exclusive.)"
3442,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>The Dalmore 1973 Vintage Gonzalez Byass Sherry Cask Finish, 42%<review>A thick, lush whisky. Notes of honey-drenched citrus, orange marmalade, chewy toffee and almonds, peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice I have come to love in Dalmore. Long, contemplative finish. This whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink."
3443,"<price>22<rating>87<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s Hopped, 40%<review>“Boiling the hops made them too bitter,” says Wiser’s master blender, Don Livermore. After more than 100 attempts he cracked the fruity-floral-hops code by “dry hopping” – adding Bravo hops to the finished whisky. Searing spices energize the earthy, grassy aroma of a freshly-mown fall meadow. Caramels—some sweet, some burnt—with early blushes of coffee or milk chocolate slowly fade into a vaguely bitter finish. (Canada only) C$29"
3444,"<price>63<rating>81<whiskey>Laird of Findlay, 40%<review>For years, about half a dozen large oak barrels of malt spirit sat ignored against the wall of the shop at Okanagan distillery in Vernon, BC. Fruit spirit is their main product. Finally, those barrels have been disgorged and blended into a fruit-forward single malt that tilts and dips like a butterfly in flight. Ripe cherries and dried apricots flit through Kraft caramels and green apple Twizzlers into a long, glowing sunset of hot spices and floral breezes. C$70"

Toffee, sweet and tangy satsuma, a dash of clove, chocolate-dipped lemon biscuits, and a hint of oak astringency usher in a finish of bitter peel oils and ground pepper. Try a splash of water to accentuate the bitter orange notes. £37"
3446,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Singleton of Glendullan Select, 40%<review>This showcases House Tully’s leaping fish sigil. The nose yields honey, barley sugar, walnuts, and plums.

3447,"<price>173<rating>85<whiskey>Kininvie 23 year old (Batch 3), 42.6%<review>As if making up for lost time, wee bottles of Kininvie are popping out every month. This is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of Glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of Balvenie. Here, flowers are to the fore, along with creme anglaise, and a light herbal edge. There’s some weight to the palate, but very little oakiness. A perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. A perfect spring dram. £120"

This and Batch 006 are the same whiskey, the same age, from different warehouse floors. Smooth sweet nose of oak and hot corn. Quite spicy on the tongue, hard-dancing oak vaults high in the mouth over a strong, sweet body. Solid oaky finish. Honest and foursquare as a Tennessee farmer; no surprises, but no disappointments either. Sourced whiskey."
3449,"<price>28<rating>81<whiskey>Jefferson's 'Very Small Batch' Bourbon, 44%<review>Style: Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Color: Amber Aroma: Clean, uncomplicated.

3451,"<price>15<rating>71<whiskey>Black Velvet Cinnamon Rush, 35%<review>One of the most popular flavored whiskies today is Fireball cinnamon, so it’s no surprise that other cinnamon whiskies are entering the market. This one has a lovely, woody, cinnamon nose that bursts into sweet, blistering cinnamon on the palate. Cinnamon is a natural whisky flavor, but here, rather than complement the underlying whisky, it completely masks it. This is a cinnamon liqueur, and a good one. A fun shooter, perhaps, but it’s barely whisky."
3452,"<price>60<rating>82<whiskey>John David Albert’s Taos Lightning Rye, 45%<review>Like the other Taos Lightning Rye, there’s an MGP provenance that’s topped with local aging; it is stated to be a 5 year old whiskey. There’s the signature brittle-dry mint of this mashbill, some hot oak and shortbread. The mouth is quick, spicy, and hot, but not over-balanced in any direction. Good, but not setting off the shock and awe."
3453,"<price>168<rating>89<whiskey>Port Charlotte PC12, 58.7%<review>Distilled in 2002, here’s Port Charlotte with an assured maturity. Amber in color, with some smoke and a pleasing whiff of cowshed (sweet hay and cow’s breath), before rosehip syrup and ozonic freshness. Water brings out incense, cream, even a little nuttiness. The palate is gently complex; a drop of water is needed to calm the heat and reveal the smoke that interweaves between the layers. It retains its fresh acidic finish, with nutmeg, soft lemon, and pear. Excellent. £110"

From this single component, blender Mark Balkenende selected mature whisky exhibiting sweet flowers, pear juice, vanilla, fresh grain, mild barrel tones, clean dry wood, brisk spices, and a long, glowing finish. Very floral, fruity, and quaffable. ($55CAD; Ontario only)"
3455,"<price>93<rating>80<whiskey>BenRiach Solstice 17 year old (Batch 2), 50%<review>Or ‘Fumabat Porticus’ as it should be called—smoky whisky in a port cask—not that you need to be told that when you see the color. The port takes the upper hand on the nose, giving a layer of black raspberry, sloe, and cranberry sauce. The smoke hangs in the background. This juicy fruitiness carries through to the tongue where the smoke now adds much-required dry balance. The higher alcohol also stops it becoming too jammy. £59"
3456,"<price>135<rating>91<whiskey> Macallan 15 year old Double Cask, 43%<review>Initially, a fleeting aroma of farmyard, followed by furniture polish, spice, apple peel, and cocktail cherries.

3457,"<price>60<rating>83<whiskey>Wyoming Double Cask Sherry Finished Bourbon<review>Pale gold in color. Generous oak imparts honeycomb, white chocolate, vanilla custard, and some mint notes that hint of a delicate, pretty bourbon.

An aroma of sweet shops, vanilla, and white pepper on the nose, becoming maltier, with dates, sultanas, figs. Apples and pears on the light-ish palate, with coconut and ginger. The finish is fruity—spicy
satsumas—and finally, drying. £62"
3459,"<price>803<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1964 (Cask #4719), 48.5%<review>A sherry butt this time, which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you'd expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, Armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512"

Distilled from a mash of 90% rye, matured in new and once-used barrels, and masterfully blended to produce a bold, spicy, complex whisky with aromas of vanilla, baking spices, and butterscotch. Crown Royal’s classic minty, piney palate melds gloriously with gingery heat and sweet clove oil cushioned by ripe cherries, fruit cocktail, and soft milk chocolate. Sugar and spice on the medium-long finish blanket barrel notes and fresh lumber."

Blenders’ Mash is a rare opportunity to taste a component of that unit. Distilled from 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley, then matured in new oak, this whisky is massive and bourbon-like. It ages slowly in Canada’s cold winters for 13 years, becoming very complex, yet not too woody. Rather, it is packed with creamy caramels, vanilla, gingery white pepper, dark fruits, floral tones, and accenting barrel notes. Number 5 in the 2018 Top 20

3466,"<price>175<rating>95<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism Felicitas, 53%<review>
Rich and sweet aromas of toasted coconut, honey, ripe pear, green apple, and honeysuckle. The palate is resplendent in golden honey, creamy vanilla, tangy peels, and pepper, with the higher ABV pushing it on and on. Compared to Hedonism Quindecimus and The Muse, this is richer, with greater complexity, and the subtle interplay between the fruits is outstanding. Unforgettably good whisky.

3467,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Redbreast, 15 year old, 46%<review>Redbreast 12 year old is a classic pure pot still Irish whiskey; where can you go from there? This new 15 year old expression is more muscular (bottling at 46% and not chill filtering certainly helps), but there are trade-offs. It’s a bit closed on the nose (like a great Bordeaux wine that’s too young). I do enjoy the silky/oily texture, the bold resinous oak spice grip on the finish, and the rich nutty toffee, fig, black raspberry, chocolaty, chewy nougat throughout the palate. Still, it’s not as eminently drinkable, refined, or balanced as the 12 year old."

The outturn was 9,420 bottles. Toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose, with a follow through of vanilla. Quite viscous on the palate, with white wine, red peppers, and cinnamon, along with a tang of peat. Lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish.  "

Resembling a bourbon liqueur, the nose is replete with tangerine, orange peel, tropical fruit, and nougat. The palate circles back to classic bourbon notes that manage to find balance with the candied orange nose."

3472,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Glen Grant) 15 year old, 55.8%<review>As this is slightly closed when neat, you have to search for Glen Grant’s classic apple notes behind a tense nose which, even with water, remains inward-looking. Thankfully, this changes on the tongue with pure, very linear (typical of GG) flavors of cool mint, cucumber, basil, and yes, apple. Easy-going from a relaxed cask, but with more substance than you’d expect."

Richly textured layers of caramel, toffee, vanilla fudge, nougat, maple syrup, and rhum agricole. Blackberry, date nut bread, cinnamon, subtle cocoa, and nutmeg add complexity. Clean, polished, and perilously drinkable. A delicious wheated bourbon! (Not quite the complexity of the 2009 William Larue Weller (a benchmark wheated bourbon which I rated a 96), but getting close."

   General Comments: A big, broad-shouldered bourbon jam-packed with flavors that just won't quit. Most bourbons of this age and intensity are too woody. Not this one. It is very well-balanced from beginning to end. Bravo! Price: upper $30s. Available nationwide but produced in limited quantities."

The palate balances sweetness and spices—a bit tannic from the extra maturation in toasted oak, but well-rounded with flavors of cherries, chocolate, and spice, leading into a gentle, satisfying finish."
3476,"<price>66<rating>89<whiskey>Bruichladdich The Laddie Ten Second Limited Edition, 50%<review>Matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, and French wine casks. Clean and fresh on the early nose; crisp green apples, vanilla, and floral notes, with just a hint of maritime influence in the background. Smooth on the palate, with spicy pear, honey, and ripe peaches; soon quite drying. The floral finish lingers, with spicy honey, drying spices, and ultimately a hint of smoke. (18,000 bottles)"
3477,"<price>1593<rating>91<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1980 (bottled 2011), 43.3%<review>A vatting of three first-fill American oak casks, for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing Cellar Collection range. The nose is full of aromas of anise, blackcurrant leaf, honeysuckle, jasmine, frangipani flowers, and a subtle almond sweetness. The palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. Sublime. It won’t, however, be released in the U.S. £1,000"
3478,"<price>150<rating>89<whiskey>Murray McDavid <review>Yellow gold color. Fresh, floral aromas (reminiscent of a spring garden), creamy vanilla, honey, heather, subtle fruit, and a hint of toasted oak. Elegant and nicely balanced. Medium in body, but richly so. Richly flavored, too, and nicely balanced, with notes that echo the aromas. In fact, this is one of the most balanced whiskies I've had in quite a while. A hint of salt, spice, and seaweed on the finish linger on indefinitely. This whisky is a pure joy to drink and demonstrates why Highland Park is so highly regarded. The fact that it was aged in a bourbon cask allows this whisky's more subtle notes to be fully appreciated. Quite delicious!"
3479,"<price>85<rating>79<whiskey>Reservoir Bourbon, 50%<review>Aromas hint at a bitterly astringent, almost burnt sugar smell, like green walnut hulls. While the body is full and rich, it’s simply too hot and young to make for pleasant drinking. The finish is long and spicy, but needs more time to mellow."
3480,"<price>12<rating>82<whiskey>Early Times Kentucky Whisky, 40%<review>Hints of lime, new oak, and new leather on the nose, as well as licorice candy. Well-textured—soft and fairly smooth—on the palate, but with only faint notes of toffee, praline, pineapple, and orange slices, all struggling to emerge. There is also an overarching youthful overtone of new wood. In general, the whiskey seems thin and lacking any great depth or vibrant flavors."
3481,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>Speyburn 10 year old, 40%<review>Okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes, is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (Value Pick)"
3482,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Teeling Single Malt Whiskey, 46%<review>A new multi-vintage core expression of independent Irish single malt compiled from a vatting of whiskey finished variously in port, sherry, white burgundy, cabernet sauvignon, and Madeira. The nose suggests honey, baked lemons, ground almonds, desiccated coconut, white pepper, and soft toffee. A fabulously thick texture; thank goodness for their insistence on non-chill filtering. It’s fruity with twinkling spice, pepper, root ginger, and vanilla orbiting around a fudge-like core. The oak is present on the dry finish."
3483,"<price>80<rating>93<whiskey>Booker’s 2019-02 “Shiny Barrel Batch"" Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 62%<review>A pleasant, citrusy note of orange blossom on the nose, followed by licorice, dark cherry, cinnamon, and dusty oak. The palate is rich, mouth-filling and jammy, offering flavors of orange marmalade, sweet vanilla, maple syrup, French toast and strawberry jam. The finish is sweet corn, a reprise of orange, as well as vanilla, spice, and light tobacco. A robust bourbon (ice or water recommended) that’s subtle at the same time."
3484,"<price>58<rating>87<whiskey>Kilkerran Work in Progress 5 Sherry, 46%<review>Having released four previous “work in progress” expressions of Kilkerran, 2013 sees the launch of two editions, one matured in sherry casks and the other in bourbon barrels. The sherry-aged variant yields overripe green grapes and figs on the nose, followed by honey and plain chocolate, while the palate is quite full, softly fruity, with soft toffee and a hint of brine. The finish dries significantly, with cocoa powder, licorice, and lots of spice. £38"
3485,"<price>61<rating>89<whiskey>Talisker Storm, 45.8%<review>Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with cranberries and black currants, while peat smoke is always present, plus black pepper. The finish lingers, with walnuts and fruity peat. £40"
3486,"<price>249<rating>88<whiskey>Meiyo 15 year old Pure Malt (2020 Edition), 40%<review>
Kiwi, guava, and jackfruit aromas meld with generous malt, ginger, and cinnamon on the nose, and all carry into the palate, which is light-bodied but retains its intense flavor, as tropical fruit and toasted grain intersect with spice. Toasted nuts, sweet oak, a touch of leather, and persistent fruit into the finish. Water has an unbalancing effect, so add sparingly."
3487,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Dalwhinnie Winter’s Frost, 43%<review>The House Stark bottling is presented with an image of a dire wolf on the label. The nose yields honey, orange, malt, toffee, and a suggestion of struck matches. Medium-bodied and sweet, with red apples, apricots, milk chocolate, and white pepper. Satsumas, nutmeg, milky cocoa, and gingery oak in the medium-length finish."
3488,"<price>730<rating>92<whiskey>Tomatin, 1973 Vintage (Cask #25602), 44%<review>Aged in a refill American oak cask. Quite lively for its age, and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating. Creamy and mouth-coating, with vanilla wafer, coconut cream pie, caramel, nougat, and bright fruit (sultana, apricot, tangerine, and pineapple in syrup). Soothing finish. A very nice whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£450"
3489,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Hudson Four Grain Bourbon, 46%<review>A lovely balance of oak, clove, and sweetness come together on the nose, while the flavor shows both big impact and refinement. Oak-driven in style, with plenty of tannins and tobacco leaf, but the sweetness and structure stand up, pouring flavors of pecan, caramelized nuts, and toasted spices, with hints of pine before the persistent finish. A very solid and nicely polished bourbon."
3490,"<price>75<rating>82<whiskey>Benromach Peat Smoke, 46%<review>Invigorating and youthful, with a raw edge to it. Challenging notes of creosote, charred oak, and earthy peat fire dominate, with underlying ripe barley, honey, and caramel apple. Aggressive, but not over the top."
3491,"<price>47<rating>88<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 'Double Barreled,' 1997 Vintage, 45%<review>Nice effort overall. My gut feeling is that this whiskey might have been better a couple years ago, but I wouldn’t call the second barrel impact excessive. It’s rich and smooth, with sweeter notes of caramel, rich vanilla, and subtle candied fruit, underpinned by firm spice (especially cinnamon) which kicks in on the finish. It comes across as very traditional bourbon, with perhaps a little extra oak impact on the back end. Price is per 375 ml.
"
3492,"<price>88<rating>82<whiskey>Douglas Laing Single Minded Speyside 15 year old, 46%<review>A broad and humid aroma, like walking through hot bracken in the summer. Quite substantial, with lemon, pecan, and, in time, chestnut. It’s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue. There’s light grip, and even at 46% some level of heat. Water reveals oak and pencil shavings/cedar, while the grip has now loosened. Out comes a more crisp attack and hints of delicate top notes. The finish is pretty dry. £56"
3493,"<price>320<rating>84<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Longmorn) 1985, 49.2%<review>Plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits, here with some Demerara sugar sprinkled on the top, a little hint of almond, peppermint, candied apple, and hard fruit sweets. The palate continues in the same vein, with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. Water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water), while a green fresh note emerges in the background. Just slightly bitter behind."
3494,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>	Bruichladdich 'Rocks', 46%<review>Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit, that is. Red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative, but delightful. This is definitely  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. It's an improved version, and my rating reflects this."
3495,"<price>65<rating>94<whiskey>Benriach The Smoky Twelve, 46%<review>
Apples, pound cake, treacle, almond nougat, and vanilla aromas set up the palate’s inherent sweetness, but pay attention to the note of oyster shell minerality and wafting woodsmoke, so well integrated as to be hardly noticeable—at least until you take a sip. Sweet smoke drifts over toasted almond, Golden Delicious apple, cinnamon, and Swiss Miss hot cocoa, all sprinkled with smoked salt. It finishes with grilled apple and flavored tobacco, the smoke persistent but never ashy, and a silky texture that’s as gentle as a caress.(Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
3496,"<price>33<rating>88<whiskey>Mischief Whiskey, 45%<review>This is 8 year old 100% rye Canadian whisky that Fremont Mischief distillery imports and bottles. Congratulations are due: the rye spice-vanilla aromas are strongly similar to their younger, own-make whiskey reviewed below. The extra age shows: this is Canadian-mellow, not a fiery American rye, even at 45%. All the spice is there, and the floral/grassy complexity, but there are more rich oak notes, and a high, arching finish that sustains the whiskey on the palate."
3497,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Willett Single Barrel Cask No. 2504 9 year old, 56.6%<review>Very graceful, with a nice balance of youth and maturity. Gently sweet notes of toffee, fig, nougat, and maple syrup, spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Dark berried fruit and a hint of coconut round out the palate. Perilously more-ish bourbon with a very easy-going demeanor. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
3498,"<price>800<rating>87<whiskey>Makoto 23 year old Single Grain, 42%<review>Mandarin segments, crystalized pineapple cubes, tropical fruits, and green apple, with a dash of white pepper and ground ginger. This begins with a pleasant, supple mouthfeel of vanilla, red apple, citrus, and flitting spices. The mandarin wells up, partnered by butterscotch, ginger, and pepper, but then tumbles through flavors of Parma violets, gooseberry, and pineapple, ending up floundering in childhood cough remedies. Lip-puckering sour gooseberry finish bristling with spices. (1,000 bottles)"
3499,"<price>76<rating>87<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Macduff) 2000, 46%<review>Gordon & MacPhail’s latest bottling from Macduff distillery is a year 2000 distillation, matured in refill sherry hogsheads. American cream soda and light spices on the nose, with honey, and white pepper development. Ultimately, rum and raisin fudge. Smooth and supple in the mouth, with apple peel, soft fino sherry, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length, with spicy fruit notes. £45"
3500,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2017, 46%<review>This is the sixth—and oldest—limited annual release of Loch Gorm, distilled in 2009 and aged in oloroso sherry butts. The nose is earthy, with raisins, dry spices, smoldering peat, and a not unpleasing hint of rubber. The palate is lively with spices, sherry, cherries, and iodine-soaked peats. Aniseed, sweet sherried peat, and tingling spices in the medium-length finish. (13,500 bottles)"
3501,"<price>85<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Talisker) 6 year old 2008, 46%<review>A single cask (#10699) bottling of Talisker, distilled in the winter of 2008 and matured in a refill hogshead before bottling in May 2015. Initially, a slight hint of new make, soon displaced by digestive biscuits, brine, and black pepper. Sweet oak, earthy peat, and orchard fruits on the palate. The finish is medium in length, with black coffee, licorice, and long-lasting spices."
3502,"<price>58<rating>85<whiskey>Wigle Organic Wapsie Valley Corn, 46%<review>The first bourbon made in Pennsylvania in over 25 years, using locally-grown, organic Wapsie Valley dent corn, which comes in yellow and maroon; a 1 year old bottling. The aroma is distinctive: deep mint, clove, and red plum. Warming and sweet, then broadening on the palate, the corn becomes prominent. Finish is hot, but tasty. This is a young one, with promise."
3503,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Chicken Cock Kentucky Straight Rye, 45%<review>A bright, floral, citrusy rye that is almost grassy, offering a lot of primary grain notes of toasty breakfast cereal, fresh rye bread, and even some caraway. The floral sachet and potpourri notes are distinctively young rye, as are the vivid sizzling spices. Certainly a rye lover’s rye, as clove-studded orange sails into drying minerality and cracked pepper on the finish."
3504,"<price>84<rating>94<whiskey>Blue Hanger 6th Release Berry Bros. & Rudd, 45.6%<review>If you want proof that blended malts can be world class, you'll find it in any bottle of Blue Hanger. Lovingly created by Berry Bros. whisky maker Doug McIvor, every release has been exceptional. Even by the series’ own high standards, this sixth release surpasses itself. The nose is fresh, clean, and citrusy, with wafts of sherry. But there are smoky hints, too. And it's that peaty, earthy note on the palate that gives this release a new dimension, enriching the fruity Speyside sweetness at the whisky's core. The age and quality of the malt asserts itself throughout. This really is stunning stuff. £68"
3505,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich 15 year old 2nd Edition, 46%<review>Finished in Chateau d’Yquem casks, and it shows. There’s a creamy, honeyed sweetness and viscosity to this whisky that is very soothing. Bruichladdich’s brisk sea character cuts through the lightly syrup-like thickness and keeps the whisky fresh and lively, while notes of golden raisin, peaches, lemon gum drops, vanilla, and coconut add complexity. Satisfying salty/sweet finish."
3506,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Oban 14 year old, 43%<review>A much-beloved malt in the U.S. Some say it’s because it is easy to pronounce (though having said that, remember it’s ‘OH-bin’ and not ‘O’Bahn’). I’d prefer to think its popularity is because there is something about the fresh cleanliness of the nose, its orange oils, chocolate, and zesty-zingy and yes, occasionally salty spiciness that is instantly appealing."
3507,"<price>32<rating>90<whiskey>Henry McKenna Single Barrel 10 year old (cask #4535811), 50%<review>At 10 years old and 50% ABV, you’d expect this whiskey to pack a power punch, and while it does present solid oak and beautiful cinnamon spice, it does so with great finesse. This barrel of Henry McKenna is a great showcase of many classic bourbon notes: caramel, cinnamon, oak, orange, clove, and kettle corn. The flavors are well integrated, balanced, and backed by a wonderfully lush undertone. A solid finish that cools slightly caps off a textbook affable whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)"
3508,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection “Blend of Mashbills”, 65.8%<review>A blend of two different 11 year old bourbons—one being a rye-based bourbon, the other being wheat-based. The wheat lends drinkability, while the rye contributes a spicy zing. The combination works very nicely, with light toffee, nutty caramel, nougat, soft orchard fruit, black cherry, vanilla, and cinnamon. (Note: this is the first of three different batches that will eventually be bottled.)"
3509,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 12 year old (2015 release), 50%<review>Many of the Birthday Bourbon releases are wood driven, and this one is particularly so. Very spicy, with warming cinnamon and cool mint. Roasted nuts, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), tangerine, and apricot emerge occasionally, along with a foundation of vanilla and caramel. Firm, resinous grip on the finish."
3510,"<price>60<rating>94<whiskey>Wild Turkey Rare Breed Barrel Proof Straight Rye, 56.1%<review>

Rare Breed bourbon enjoys notoriety as a great value, and this new rye stands shoulder to shoulder with it. A gift for Wild Turkey fans from master distillers Jimmy and Eddie Russell, it’s not chill-filtered, making it even more full-bodied and rich. Zesty aromas of mint, eucalyptus, pine, and cedar chest mingle with sliced orange, candied strawberry, and sweet pecans on the nose, and that profile carries over into the nutty, spiced, herbaceous, and citrus-sweet flavors of the palate. With water the full spectrum of flavors—and the harmonious interplay of grain and barrel—reveal themselves, leaving an unforgettable impression of perfectly controlled power. Number 5 in the 2020 Top 20"
3511,"<price>300<rating>92<whiskey>Highland Park The Dark 17 year old, 52.9%<review>Matured exclusively in sherry-seasoned first-fill European oak casks and bottled at cask strength. The nose yields figs, soft smoke, cinnamon, sugarcane, and rich fruitcake. The palate is succulent and confident, with creamy sweet sherry, dried fruits, coffee, and woodsmoke. Long and drying in the finish, with flecks of char. Highland Park doing what it does best. (28,000 bottles)"
3512,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Matsui Mizunara Cask, 48%<review>Very pale, fresh whisky, with lychee, fresh pear, morning dew, apple notes, and just a dash of salt and white pepper. It’s a honeyed and thick dram on the palate, with caramelized apples and tangerine, then late bittersweet citrus that attempts to dampen down the jackhammer of pepper. Enjoyable weight, texture, and flavors, but the mizunara signature notes are a little subtle and underplayed. (3,972 bottles)"
3513,"<price>130<rating>86<whiskey>Amrut PX Sherry Single Cask #2702, 62.8%<review>The first of three Iron Dram single cask Amrut whiskies released for the European market. The Pedro Ximénez cask certainly has the upper hand here. Black cherry, dried cranberry, blueberry, and mixed peel mingle with apple peelings, baked pear, thick-skinned sultanas, and chocolate frosting. Tart piquancy to the fore on the palate, but it melts to show glacé cherry, baked apples, pear, and ground almonds. Water brings the childhood sweetness of old-fashioned Kola Kubes. Oodles of character. £77"
3514,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Old Forester 1920 Prohibition Style Whiskey Row Series, 57.5%<review>The perfect proof. Rich in color, aroma, and flavor. It begins with powerful caramel, baking spice, chocolate, cherries, cinnamon, and toffee. Then nuance and complexity. Honey, jalapeño, rosemary, crème brûlée, malt, and fruit, from the spicy citrus of grapefruit to prunes and dried apricots. Hard to believe this is over 100 proof, as you never sense the strength challenging you to find what’s next amidst the subtlety. Extremely long finish with cherry, cinnamon, and caramel. Value Pick."
3515,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Van Winkle 18 year old Family Reserve, 52.6%<review>Style: Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Color: Deep amber Aroma: Deep, very mature, dry and spicy (especially spearmint), with underlying notes of ripe fruit, polished oak, and leather. The aroma is so thick, you almost need a knife to cut through it. Palate: Rich, thick, and chewy in texture-sweeter up front, then drying out towards its finish. Rather bold in flavors that are identical to its aroma, but never overpowering. Soothing, satisfying finish that seems to linger on forever."
3516,"<price>140<rating>81<whiskey>Chichibu The Floor Malted 3 year old, 50.5%<review>Another work in progress from the ever-enterprising Ichiro Akuto. This is made from barley that was malted by him and his team in Norfolk. Unusually for a Japanese malt, the aroma is, yes, malty, but it is more chaff-like than nutty. Chichibu’s floral element is there alongside grape must, verjus, and herbs. The palate is a fascinating mix of the very sweet with balancing dry and sour notes. A distillery that’s growing up fast. £90"
3517,"<price>174<rating>89<whiskey>BenRiach 21 year old, 46%<review>BenRiach’s latest release was matured in a combination of four diverse cask types: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and red wine. The nose offers tangerines, milk chocolate, and spicy vanilla. Peaches, Brazil nuts, raisins, dates, and more chocolate on the palate, with red berries in the background. The finish is medium in length, with cocoa powder and ginger. £125; Not available in the U.S."
3518,"<price>75<rating>93<whiskey>Gooderham & Worts Eleven Souls, 49%<review>This blend of eleven whiskies commemorates the eleven children William Gooderham adopted. Hints of cereal grain, creamy mouthfeel, blossoming caramel sweetness, and an increasingly peppery glow with suggestions of sweetish ginger and clove. Black fruits: figs, plums, dates, and prunes. Slowly develops pulling wood tannins. More components than mainstream Gooderham & Worts, yet just as tightly integrated. (Canada exclusive) $100 CAD"
3519,"<price>2750<rating>86<whiskey>The Macallan Masters of Photography 1991 (Release 3, Cask #7023), 50.8%<review>This time we’ve got Macallan in savory mode, even a little balsamic. The spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995, with typical Macallan heft. Now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. Maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. The palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask, with positive bitterness and wedding cake. Though grippy, it has great balance. 285 bottles."
3520,"<price>325<rating>87<whiskey>Linkwood, 1996 vintage, 58.2%<review>Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). While this is a very enjoyable whisky, I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of Linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. Still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200"
3521,"<price>430<rating>90<whiskey>Penderyn Bourbon single cask, cask strength, 61.2%<review>The unusual distilling process and some maturation in Madeira casks has given standard Penderyn a liqueur-like, perfumey quality many whisky fans don’t care for. This is a single bourbon cask bottling of the 11th cask the distillery ever filled, to mark its 10th anniversary, and is less cloying, less feminine, and more gutsy than the standard version. It’s also very palatable and of excellent quality. Some will make it to America, but the price tag will deter all but the most passionate. "
3522,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon, 44%<review>An aromatic nose reveals chamomile tea, dried herbs, peanut shells, fresh sawdust, snickerdoodles, brown sugar, and stone fruit. The palate is simple but pleasing, with black tea, licorice, bitter nuts, dry oak, and a touch of cinnamon. It finishes fairly short, with pleasant flavors of eucalyptus, black pepper, and oak."
3523,"<price>57<rating>89<whiskey>Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old, 46%<review>Rich on the nose, with stewed fruit, butterscotch, and soft spices. Very smooth palate delivery, with luscious fruit flavors: baked apples and peaches in syrup, then cinnamon and ginger. The medium-length finish features ebbing spice and developing milk chocolate. Likely sourced from Tullibardine Distillery."
3524,"<price>350<rating>87<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado Cask Finish (1997 vintage), 54.9%<review>One of six whiskies released in Distell’s first Malt Collection. This received a secondary maturation of almost 2 years in Palo Cortado casks, rarely used for Scotch whisky. Melon slices sprinkled with salt, vanilla, and finally, peach blossom on the nose. More peaches on the spicy palate, with milk chocolate and oak. Peppery in the medium-length finish, with aniseed. (1,644 bottles)"
3525,"<price>81<rating>80<whiskey>Caol Ila Distillers Edition 1998, 43%<review>The finish in question here is Muscatel casks and you can tell that from the start, as the nose is filled with a rich, sweet, and very pronounced dusky fruitiness — sloes and plums. The smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. While the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue, the effect is almost liqueur-like. It’s a very pleasing dram, but the question is, is it Caol Ila?"
3526,"<price>138<rating>81<whiskey>Inchmurrin 21 year old, 46%<review>This is the oldest expression of Inchmurrin to be released by Loch Lomond, who make it in their highly versatile distillery at
Alexandria. Brittle toffee and cod liver oil on the nose, with vanilla and a whiff of Jaffa oranges. Smooth and full on the palate, more substantial and sophisticated than the younger Inchmurrin variants. The fruits are now more citric. Lengthy and unctuous in the finish, with more citrus fruit, gentle spice, and a touch of oak. £90"
3527,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Ainsley Brae Sauternes Cask Finished Highland, 40%<review>A sweet and clean nose, with aromas of confectioners’ sugar, meringue, vanilla, and almond flour. The balanced palate has richer layers of oak, blueberry jam, red berries, candied ginger, and chocolate, leading into a quick but pleasant finish with a hint of spice. (Total Wine & More)"
3528,"<price>49<rating>77<whiskey>Sons of Liberty Hop Flavored Whiskey, 40%<review>Lemony, pine woods, even some seashore aromas over the sweetness of the malt whiskey underneath. Not overly bitter, more whiskey-sweet, and the aromas are subdued in the mouth. I like a big hoppy IPA, but this isn’t setting my palate. I think it’s missing the body of a beer. I have yet to have a hopped whiskey that I really like; this isn’t it either."
3529,"<price>230<rating>83<whiskey>St. George's Founder's Private Cellar Port Cask 0859, 59.3%<review>We’ve recorded the changing role of portwood use in whisky, with Tasmania and the likes of Amrut and Penderyn putting it center stage. St. George's hasn't…yet. But port clearly has momentum, because this has sold faster than the other two Founder's Private Cellar releases. Yet it doesn't quite work; the port is held in check so that the berry fruit compote, the earthiness of the malt, and a spearmint note clash with each other. £148"
3530,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Dingle Single Malt (Batch No. 4), 46.5%<review>This elegant, well-balanced Dingle is created from whiskey matured in bourbon, sherry, and port casks which bring out orange zest, cherry gummies, vanilla, strawberry, barley sugar, and a good rub of ground aromatic spices on the nose. Baked fruits, taffy, strawberry, raspberry coulis, clove, and pepper open up, leading to shortbread sweetness, candied peel, and more sherry fruit, while perky spices are left to carry through on the finish. (12,000 bottles)"
3531,"<price>250<rating>88<whiskey>Aultmore 21 year old, 46%<review>The nose offers early grassiness, then vanilla, Jaffa orange, toffee apple, and honey. A smooth palate delivery, with more orange and toffee apple, plus almonds and caramel. The finish is long, with white pepper and sweet oak."
3532,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Penderyn Peated Single Malt, 46%<review>This rather good after-dinner dram is finished in peated Islay whisky casks. It is not a peated Welsh whisky, but don’t let that stop you. With its refreshing aromas of lemon floor polish, pine needles, gentle antiseptic, smoked fish, and breezy beach bonfires, we can cheerfully drop the pedantic objections to its name. This successfully delivers a wallop of spicy smoke, lemon, and vanilla biscuits, a bit like consuming creamy rice pudding beside a smoking peat kiln.(396 bottles for U.S.)"
3533,"<price>47<rating>89<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 115, 45%<review>More caramelized sugars (caramel and toffee), with darker fruit than the 105 and 90. More oak spice influence too, but balanced nicely by the sweeter notes. Mouth-coating, viscous, and lubricating in texture. Price is per 375 ml."
3534,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>West Cork Glengarriff Series Peat Charred Cask, 43%<review>An innovative approach to flavoring casks by charring the staves with burning peat, this whiskey develops a smoldering nose of dark chocolate brownies, dry wood smoke, and cocoa sweetness. The impact of the peat is confined to the nose, but it tastes pleasantly oily, with tangy citrus, Jolly Rancher hard candy, chocolate cake, spices, fizzy candies, and coffee notes. The finish of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and dried peel rounds off an extremely tasty whiskey. (4,800 bottles)"
3535,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2010, 50%<review>This 8 year old was distilled using Bere barley, a low-yielding heritage strain grown on the Orkney Islands. Aromas of a damp cellar; oily, nutty, with cereal, burlap, and mild orchard fruit notes. The palate is persistently oily, with pineapple, honey, nutmeg, and white pepper. Drying in the finish, with licorice, coal, and strong black tea. Proof that barley varieties can make a difference. (18,000 bottles; individual reviewer rating: 92)"
3536,"<price>132<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Blair Athol) Autumn Berries, 46%<review>Distilled in 1986, this single cask from Blair Athol distillery in Perthshire yielded 268 bottles, and the nose offers sweet fruits, principally apple and orange, plus walnuts, vanilla, and brittle toffee. Becoming softer and creamier with time. Dark fruit notes on the palate, notably blackcurrants and cranberries, with caramel and cinnamon. The finish is quite viscous, with a little oak, freshly-squeezed lemons, and licorice twists. £85 "
3537,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Glenlivet Nàdurra 16 year old, 57.2%<review>Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks and bottled unfiltered and at natural cask strength. This takes the usually subtle Glenlivet and makes it more vibrant, amplifying its flavors while accentuating the bourbon oak. Tight notes of honeyed malt, vanilla bean, toasted oak, bright fruit, and nuts, are peppered with more subtle floral and spice notes. Dry, spicy finish. A Glenlivet with pizzazz."
3538,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 14 year old, 46%<review>Red apple skin, sharp citrus zest, peach stone, and shortcake biscuit greet the nose, though there is abundant grain character, with lemongrass and coriander seeds too. A muscular dram from a closed distillery, this reveals sweet cereals, honey, a spectrum of citrus notes, sherbet sweetness, pepper, clove, and herbal notes. Sweetness remains with the pepper in the finish, though clove reigns supreme when water is added."
3539,"<price>135<rating>84<whiskey>Edradour Ballechin Sauternes Cask Matured, 46%<review>The eighth edition of heavily-peated Edradour bottled under the Ballechin label is part of the distillery’s Discovery Series and has been aged in Sauternes wine casks. The nose yields sweet, fruity smoke, cocoa, and spice. Sweet and soft on the palate, with more fruity smoke, notably pineapple-influenced, with a hint of smoked fish. The finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits."
3540,"<price>485<rating>89<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Springbank) 1969 Vintage 34 year old, 54.4%<review>Older Springbanks are becoming hard to find, and this one won't disappoint. It is packed with citrus notes (lemon, orange) often found in whiskies over 30 years old. Along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon), red licorice, polished oak, and that signature Springbank fresh brininess, albeit a bit reserved. This Springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. If I wanted to be picky, I would like to see more of the Springbank briny zest and freshness here, but, giving its age, it is understandably reserved. This whisky's best feature is how surprisingly clean, rounded, and polished it is for 33 years old. Very nice."
3541,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 9 year old Bottled in Bond (Fall 2018 Release), 50%<review>A somewhat tight nose, with cocoa, spiced oak, brown sugar, and saddle leather; water reveals vivid vanilla and a bit of banana. The initial honeyed sweetness and chocolate-covered peanut cluster flavors quickly get brushed aside by the tannic oak and searing spice. Drinks a bit hot and hurried—with Szechuan pepper heat before a jolt of citrus oil. (18,000 bottles)"
3542,"<price>150<rating>93<whiskey>Old Forester 150th Anniversary Batch Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch 01/03), 62.8%<review>

Grape Kool-Aid, cherry cola, blueberries, tea leaf, walnuts, ginger, and polished oak lead the nose and carry into the chewy, full palate. This whiskey shows its maturity with well-integrated spice, semi-sweet chocolate, Concord grape jelly, and roasted nuts, all in sync with undulating oak. Warmth builds into the finish as cooked dark fruits and dark chocolate melt slowly away to reveal black pepper and ginger on a bed of polished oak."
3543,"<price>185<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Strathisla), Cask #8510, 25 year old, 48.7%<review>Very thick in texture and mouthcoating -- almost chewy -- with ripe barley, shortbread cookies, and honey up front. Dried vanilla, violet, cinnamon, and bright fruit notes emerge mid-palate. The dried spices and moderate oak tannins linger on the finish, contrasting the whisky’s rich, sweet entry. If this whisky were a road, there would be a lot of hills."
3544,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Highland Park) 1988 14 year old, 46%<review>Deep gold color. Nicely balanced aroma of honeyed malt, fruit, floral notes, and a hint of the sea. Medium in body and smooth. The palate begins with soothing honey notes, followed by a rich maltiness. Ripe fruit flavors emerge, lush and delicious. The whisky eventually becomes dry and floral, with a suggestion of salt."
3545,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Millstone 92 Rye, 46%<review>Very fragrant, with notes of fresh ripe plum, crisp spice, herbs, caramel, treacle, black pepper, and hints of dark chocolate. Leave the glass alone and the spices really hit their stride. The flavor shifts imperceptibly, covering citrus, vanilla, chocolate, and ripe orchard fruits, generating a slow build-up of spices like a gathering storm: your taste buds have nowhere left to run. Beautifully paced."
3546,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Port Charlotte Islay Barley 2011, 50%<review>This includes whisky distilled from barley grown on three Islay farms. It was mainly matured in first-fill American oak, along with Syrah and merlot wine casks. Fragrant peat, warm tar, ginger, vanilla, and sea salt on the nose. Peaches dipped in salt on the palate, with milk chocolate and more vanilla, then dark berries. The peat is spicy and quite acrid in the long, briny finish."
3547,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft Rare Spanish Brandy Finish, 43%<review>Quite the antithesis of the Signature Craft 12 year old, released at the same time. This one is finished in Spanish brandy barrels, so I expect it to be a polarizing whiskey. The brandy influence shows, with sweet fruit (sultana, honeyed tangerine, pineapple, ripe apricot) and spice (vanilla, cinnamon, ginger) interwoven with caramel. No age statement. Youthful, but not immature. A limited edition release."
3548,"<price>47<rating>89<whiskey>Auchentoshan The Bartender’s Malt 001, 47%<review>Twelve of the world’s leading bartenders collaborated to create this limited release. Whiskies chosen spanned five decades, and were aged in various oak barrels, including American and German, as well as rum, red wine, and Laphroaig casks. The nose is rich and fruity, with Jaffa oranges, apricots, caramel, and soft ginger. Voluptuous on the palate, with nectarines, Brazil nuts, nutmeg, and honey. Warming spices in the lengthy finish, with lingering nectarine notes."
3549,"<price>17<rating>76<whiskey>Southern Comfort Bold Black Cherry, 35%<review>A medicinal cherry smell, like cough syrup and cherry PEZ, edged with a nutty hint of almonds. Medium-bodied; a slow-flow on the tongue. The cherry doesn’t taste real (like Red Stag’s does), and the SoCo sweetness doesn’t help that. There is a pickup at the end, as the spirit seems to evaporate off the tongue. I can’t help thinking that this should have been a slam-dunk…but they missed."
3550,"<price>53<rating>82<whiskey>The Macallan 12 year old, 40%<review>It’s young Macallan. There’s a hint of sulfur (from distillate rather than cask), then wet leather, Brazil nut, muesli, dried pineapple, and raisin; even a little rubber, suggestive of youth. That can’t hide the fact that this is a big, deep, oily dram. Water makes it considerably more coherent, showing a substantial, thick palate with some licorice. Ripe, but you can’t help feeling that 12 is a little young for this slow-maturing distillate."
3551,"<price>175<rating>92<whiskey>Kavalan Ex-Bourbon Cask Strength Single Cask, 57.8%<review>Delicately complex. Dried vanilla, pineapple, toasted coconut, tangerine, and cream. A kiss of honey and polished oak on the finish. Quite lovely and very versatile; it would make a delicious pre-dinner dram. (Julio’s Liquors and Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
3552,"<price>45<rating>81<whiskey>Leopold Bros. Maryland Style Straight Rye (Barrel #139), 43%<review>Aromas of black tea, clove, allspice, horehound, Vicks VapoRub, new wood, and wet leaves on a forest floor give way to a chewy palate led by green oak, with flavors of cinnamon, semi-dark chocolate, tarragon, mint, licorice, and allspice. It finishes with spiced dark chocolate, menthol, and a slight nuttiness. Water helps integrate the herbal and spice flavors with the oak."
3553,"<price>189<rating>90<whiskey>Chivas Regal 20 year old Ultis 1999 Victory Edition, 40%<review>Blended from 20 year old Strathisla, Longmorn, and Braeval whiskies to mark Manchester United’s treble—triple trophy win—in 1999, this is a drink of understated elegance. Orange peel, toffee, fine-roasted spices, vanilla extract, with hints of cocoa and malt on the nose. Creamy palate with Whoppers, candied orange peel, orange sherbet crystals, and mild spices, with a later phase of baked orange and butterscotch, it remains creamy and soothing to the finish."
3554,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Straight Edge Bourbon, 42%<review>A composite of 5, 7, and 8 year old Kentucky and Tennessee bourbons. It offers exceptional color at this ABV, but the grain and oak-forward nose suggests youth, with hints of medicinal boiling oatmeal and cinnamon. Slightly dry to adhesive mouthfeel is followed by menthol, heavy smoke, cinnamon-custard pie, licorice, caramel, and a hint of cherry cough syrup. With the stocks selected for this batch, I’d hoped for more, but it tastes unlike traditional bourbon. Sourced whiskey."
3555,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Lost Spirits Abomination The Crying of the Puma, 54%<review>An aggressive punch of peat—creosote, tar, rubber, and seaweed—mingles with wood spice, butterscotch, vanilla pudding, and red apple on the nose. The palate shows charred meat, charred wood, earthy smoke, crème brûlée, and red apple flavors. The short, ashy finish satisfies with dark chocolate and black pepper. At such a high proof, it takes water well and develops in the glass.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;
Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland, then blended, exported, and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of toasted oak treated with Riesling wine."
3556,"<price>79<rating>88<whiskey>Ranger Creek .36 Single Barrel (barrel #503), 48%<review>The .36 Small Caliber was one of the best young small-barrel bourbons I’ve ever had, so I was very much looking forward to this 3 year, 8 month old bottling from “traditional large barrels.” Aroma: like a 12 year old bourbon: oak spice, corn sweet. Not hot, spice and vanilla, smooth but oaky, with a light, flowing feel. A unique combination of youth and maturity that opens the “Texas whiskey” niche a bit wider. (Spec’s exclusive)"
3557,"<price>16000<rating>92<whiskey>Glenfiddich 50 year old, 46.1%<review>We’re drinking liquid history here. Antique gold color. Aromas of dried citrus, lemongrass, and ginger with background honeyed vanilla, dried herb, bouquet of roses, and a wisp of smoke. Very long and evolving on the palate, going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard, crème brulee, white chocolate, candied citrus, juicy oak, polished leather, dried tobacco, and then resinous oak, with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. Long dry, resinous finish. Remarkably well-maintained for its age. I can tell that it’s an old whisky, but it shows good complexity. It’s not tired and excessively oaked.
When compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions, it’s actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample I have. Yet it doesn’t have the deft balance and roundness which I consider a hallmark of the 30. Bottom line here: Anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. It’s really nice. But for us regular folk, try to pick up a 30 year old Glenfiddich if you can find one and you won’t go wrong with the whisky — or the price (relatively speaking, that is)."
3558,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Braddock Oak Single Barrel (Batch #T517K6), 46%<review>With spearmint, licorice, dried flowers, cedar, and new oak on the nose, it’s no surprise to taste a wood-forward palate. Iced tea with orange peel, spearmint, grain, sweet cedar, and drying oak lead into a finish of menthol, dark cocoa, and shoe polish. Youthful, with some rough edges, but enjoyable. Distilled by Catoctin Creek from 100% rye. (Total Wine & More)"
3559,"<price>47<rating>83<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection #7 Heavy Char Barrel, 45%<review>There’s a reason why bourbon distillers don’t char their barrels to this intensity. Aged over 15 years, this is a bold whiskey, with lovely honeyed fruit and creamy vanilla on the nose and palate. But it’s bullied by the charred oak, brandishing oak tannins and leather, along with background tobacco and over-roasted nuts. Dry, charred oak finish. There’s a lovely sweetness that does challenge all this charred oak, but it eventually loses the battle. Price is per 375ml."
3560,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Balcones True Blue Cask Strength Corn (Batch TB17-1), 68.3%<review>Baking spices, pipe tobacco, vanilla, citrus peel, cardamom, dried apricots, and dates unwind on the nose, carried by plenty of fresh oak. The potent palate explodes with up-front sweetness, laced with cocoa and maduro tobacco notes, but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish. A splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine."
3561,"<price>62<rating>87<whiskey>Arran The Peacock 1996 Vintage, 46%<review>Complex, dynamic, and well-balanced. Honeyed vanilla, bright fruit (lemon, tangerine, nectarine), sultana, green grapes, and banana bread, peppered with ginger and subtle, gripping grape skin. Great mouth-feel (from the oak), which adds another dimension. That’s what 46% and no chill-filtering will do for a whisky. One of the better Arran whiskies I’ve tasted. (Released in 2009. Sadly not available in the U.S.) £38"
3562,"<price>399<rating>90<whiskey>William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Blended Reserve 26 year old, 42%<review>William Grant & Sons will be releasing a series of Ghosted Reserves in the years ahead, drawing on their remaining stock from closed distilleries. Here, Brian Kinsman has used whisky from Ladyburn and Inverleven to create a nose of zesty key lime pie, peach, butter mintoes, and sweet oak. It is truly moreish, with creamy, malty flavors of sweet mandarin, marzipan, and strawberry with a chalky mouthfeel of candy sticks that lingers through the finish. Exceptionally good whisky. (6,000 bottles)"
3563,"<price>165<rating>88<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Caperdonich), 35 year old, 1968 Vintage, 43%<review>Caperdonich is always a challenge to find. This one is aged in a sherry cask. One would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky’s profile. Not this whisky. As you would expect, it is nicely matured, but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded, too! Exotic notes of dried fruits, sultana, subtle (but viscous) honey, sandalwood, and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon, anise, ginger). Clean, subtly spicy finish. Slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures.

3564,"<price>107<rating>85<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Summer Fruit Cup 1998 (distilled at Auchentoshan), 46%<review>This is the Lowlander among Wemyss Malts’ dozen single cask releases for the fall of 2014. Maturation took place in a bourbon barrel, which yielded 295 bottles. Tinned peaches in syrup, caramel, mild vanilla, and damp tweed on the nose. Medium-bodied and intensely fruity on the palate, with apricots, raspberries, and ginger. Fruit notes linger in the finish, with spicy milk chocolate. £70"
3565,"<price>47<rating>81<whiskey>Giant French Oak Barrel 23 year old, 45%<review>Much more oak influence than its younger sibling. That lovely sweetness of the 19 year old Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel bottling is there at the beginning, but it’s quickly overtaken by oak spice, leather, and tannin notes. This one was left in the barrel a bit longer than I would prefer. If you like a wood-driven whiskey, then consider trying it. But if it’s balance you desire, look elsewhere.  Price is per 375 ml."
3566,"<price>23<rating>79<whiskey>O.Z. Tyler Rye, 44.9%<review>Aromas of lumber, wood spice, and butterscotch give way to pencil shavings, toasted sawdust, and cloying sweetness on the palate. Gentle baking spice and cherry flavors aren’t enough to redeem the assault of wood.

This whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 6 months;

3567,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight (Batch 2018-002), 50%<review>Unbaked pastry dough, swirled with brown sugar and chopped almonds, meets orange blossom water, cream soda, coconut flakes, and pistachio pudding. There’s more pastry, toasted coconut and almonds, cinnamon, brown sugar, and orange on the palate, along with plenty of oak. A splash of water goes a long way to emphasize the prettier flavors while playing down some of the youthful heat."
3568,"<price>65<rating>89<whiskey>Colkegan Apple Brandy Cask Finished Single Malt, 46%<review>Soft and juicy aromas of ginger juice, apple tart, strawberry shortcake, and light, sweet smoke. Very aromatic, with lots of citrus, clove, and cinnamon. Orange Creamsicle on the palate, with a good deal of apple, poached pear, marmalade, and light smoke. Salted butter, gentle oak, and wispy smoke keep this in balance. A good harmony of flavors."
3569,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Arran 21 year old, 46%<review>Arran’s latest addition to its core range is matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Mellow on the nose, with baked apple and toffee, then developing tropical fruits and icing sugar aromas in time. Sweet and balanced on the palate; spicy, with milk chocolate and peaches in syrup. Lengthy in the finish, with tangy fruit notes, restrained oak, and gentle spices. (9,000 bottles)"
3570,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Heaven Hill 7 year old Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Sticky Cracker Jack, butterscotch pudding, candy corn, fresh-sawn oak, and peanut butter-stuffed pretzels on the nose lead to a palate that explodes with sweet candied nuts, grape jam, citrus peel, clove, and white pepper spice. The full body, slick buttery texture, and perfect proof let the finish really roll along nicely, with the oak seamlessly integrated and finely tuned. This is bold, lively, and flavor-packed!"
3571,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Glenfiddich IPA Experiment, 43%<review>One of the duo of releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, ‘IPA’ was finished for 3 months in casks that previously held the Speyside Craft Brewery’s India pale ale. The nose offers hops and honey, malt, toffee, cooking apples, and lemon. Smooth on the palate, with more honey and toffee, soft spices and, ultimately, slightly bitter, hoppy ale notes. The finish is medium in length, with dry spices and plain chocolate."
3572,"<price>24<rating>82<whiskey>Potter’s Special Old, 40%<review>Highwood Distillers has returned from their devastating 2013 flood with better whisky than ever. A soft, sweet, fruity nose understates the power of an intensely spicy palate chock-full of sour, bitter kumquats. Subtle honey flavors abound, with delicate threads of golden burley tobacco entwined. It’s a simple dram for mixing, but with plenty of interest to satisfy those who would rather sip. Add ginger ale and ice, or drink straight up. (Canada only) C$30"
3573,"<price>47<rating>85<whiskey>High West Double Rye Single Barrel (Cask #1097-2), 50%<review>Traditionally, this release has been a showcase for the raw power and spice of both young and old rye. In this single barrel release, the spice and fire have been considerably tamed by deep caramel, vanilla, and sweet corn. The spice is still there, with oak, rye, and cinnamon, but is no longer the star. The proof shows up in the finish, which is long and quite dry. An understated expression of one of High West’s flagship releases. Sourced whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)"
3574,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1985 Vintage, 43%<review>Interestingly, this whisky was bottled in 2005, but not released until the end of 2008. (The brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s vintage (a 1987) were depleted. It’s fresh, lively, and uncluttered, glowing with bright fruit (mandarin orange, nectarine), lemon meringue pie, and a creamy vanilla sweetness that coats the palate. A gently dry oak finish with subtle anise and very dark chocolate. A perky Glenrothes, and a lot of fun to drink. 
"
3575,"<price>160<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Longmorn), 29 year old, 1973 vintage, 47.6%<review>Longmorn’s signature is a thick mouth-coating, honeyed maltiness, which is almost chewy in texture. While delicious in its teens, its personality lends itself to aging, because its maltiness provides a good counterpoint to the resinous dry oak notes which are usually imparted to older whiskies. This whisky is no exception. Notes of honey, vanilla malt, and subtle fruit dovetail nicely with the dry, resinous, polished leather-like contributions from 29 years in oak. Nice long finish.

3576,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Jacob’s Pardon 15 year old Single Barrel American Whiskey (No. 23), 70.9%<review>

Remarkably easy drinking considering its hyper-charged proof, with an equally pronounced profile of balanced sweetness. The nose exudes caramel sauce, blackberry compote, cherry, maple syrup, semi-sweet chocolate, and vanillin, with earthy notes of warehouse floor and barrel char. The palate offers chocolate mousse, rice pudding, and cooked figs, leading to a long finish of cooked plums, dark berry tart, and chocolate-covered marshmallows. Rich, viscous, and loaded with balanced sweet flavors"
3577,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye, 41.5%<review>Beginning with charcoal smoke, oak, herbs, and vanilla, grains set in, in the form of cornbread, rye muffin, and spelt pasta. This 3 year old lacks the mouthfeel or richness one hopes for in a rye. The finish is flat and short. This is an okay cocktail mixer, but lacks the oomph for a sipper."
3578,"<price>73<rating>87<whiskey>Copper House Triple Grain No. 2, 43%<review>This is one of the first two releases from Copper House, a distillery contained within the Adnams brewery at Southwold on the east coast of England. If you know Adnams’ beers, it will come as no surprise that it's breaking new ground by creating a whisky with a mashbill of wheat, oats, and barley. This is only 3 years old but a soft toffee creaminess, chocolate orange, oak, and pepper ensure a delightful and surprisingly full whisky. £44"
3579,"<price>30<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Moray Elgin Classic Chardonnay Cask Finish, 40%<review>After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. The nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper."
3580,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Ohishi 8 year old Sherry Cask-Finished (2020 Release), 42.1%<review>
Fantastically nutty sherry notes, like a good amontillado, with aromas of cooking apple, plum, pecan pie, pencil shavings, and wood spices. The sherry cask adds depth, flair, subtlety, and expressiveness to both the nose and palate. To taste, there is orange peel, nuts, crystallized grapefruit peel, fresh plum, clove, and pepper. The sweet light flavors keep it aloft as more base notes help to fill it out. (4,090 bottles)"
3581,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Kilchoman 'Inaugural Release,' 46%<review>Aged 2.5 to 3 years on bourbon casks and then finished in sherry casks for 6 months. Wow, this is quite stunning! Old-fashioned in many respects: oily texture, with rooty, layered peat smoke, coal tar, shoe polish, and hints of wet sheep as the foundation for a complex array of additional flavors: toffee apple, caramel fudge, blackberry jam, golden raisin, grist, bourbon barrel char, and licorice root. Long, smoldering ember, dried herb, light toffee finish. It’s all balanced perfectly, and very mature for its age. If you like smoky whiskies, track one down. (Not available in the U.S.) £37.00"
3582,"<price>359<rating>88<whiskey>Auchroisk 30 year old Special Release 2012, 54.7%<review>The original Singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.  "
3583,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>10th Street STR Cask American Single Malt, 46%<review>Cooked malt, roasted chestnuts, and cigar box aromas mingle with caramel-nut clusters, brown sugar, grilled fruit, and new oak. It’s rich and roasty, with a velvety texture on the palate; the malt takes center stage, highlighted by bright citrus and herbaceous pine, as well as cooked fruit and hints of tobacco, with prominent oak flavors. Chocolate-covered candied orange peel and roasted nuts mingle with cigar on the finish."
3584,"<price>26<rating>80<whiskey>Gibson’s Sterling, 40%<review>This entry-level Gibson’s is cut from the same fine cloth as the exquisite Gibson’s 18 and their lavishly flavorful 12 year old. Immediately, rum and butter laced with spirit and hot pepper seep into sweet and sizzling rye spices. Then light berry-ish notes turn to Concord grapes, pear juice, and soft yellow apples, as bitter walnut skins counter rich maple ice cream. A slight waxiness lends a satisfying weight.

3587,"<price>30<rating>81<whiskey>Catskill Most Righteous Bourbon, 42.5%<review>Simple nose of corn, oak, cinnamon candy, and ash. Candy sweet, grainy, still simple, and a bit thin; increasingly hot at the end. Needs more breadth and depth, but there’s nothing seriously flawed. I’d characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout; nice footwork, solid performance, and dealing some good hits, but the bigger, older bourbons give it a palate-pounding. Price is per 375 ml."
3588,"<price>250<rating>91<whiskey>Chicken Cock Double Barrel 10 year old, 52%<review>The Double Barrel name denotes the fact that each batch is a blend from only two barrels. Fragrant notes of warm cinnamon bread, raisins, banana, and clove on the nose, along with toasty oak and old leather. A new burst of flavors on the palate reveals cocoa powder, spice cake, coconut, creamy chocolate, cinnamon, and chili pepper. A long finish of rich chocolate, almond, and a delicate hint of blackberry."
3589,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Tomatin, 18 year old, 43%<review>Fuller in body, deeper and more complex than the 12 year old (as would be expected). Sweeter fruits (honey-laced citrus, lemon gum drops, and ripe peach) and rum notes marry nicely with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger). Calming finish. An intelligent use of sherry cask aging. 
"
3590,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Dalmore 12 year old, 40%<review>Matured in bourbon barrels and oloroso sherry casks. Tangerines, barley sugar, milky coffee, soft toffee, and sweet sherry on the inviting nose. Orange carries over to the palate, with spicy dark chocolate, ginger, and cocktail cherries. The finish features vanilla, long-lasting dark chocolate, and prunes."
3591,"<price>76<rating>78<whiskey>Girvan No. 4 Apps, 42%<review>The entry level official Girvan is named after their ‘MPS’ distillation apparatus that distills at various pressures and under vacuum to vaporize and distill at lower temperatures. This is very light, with fresh whole pineapples, orange fondant creams, delicate vanilla, and risen dough. It’s fiendishly sweet (have a dental hygienist on standby), like a deep layer of butter frosting, sticky cotton candy, honey, overripe bananas, and spearmint. The expeditious finish tenders cookie mix, digestive biscuits, and a grind of pepper. £45"
3592,"<price>100<rating>86<whiskey>Br5 Elements of Islay (distilled at Bruichladdich), 53.8%<review>The nose is slightly closed, all very delicate, with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. This gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through, alongside patisserie, icing, gentle vanilla, and an effect like Hedione, the ‘smell’ of sunshine. Rounded and very sweet, typical of the distillery, with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. It slightly loses it with water, so keep neat. A pleasant, straight down the middle Laddie. £60/500 ml"
3593,"<price>102<rating>90<whiskey>Armorik Millésime 2014, 55.7%<review>This third single cask release was distilled in 2002 and spent two-thirds of its maturation in oloroso after 4 years in bourbon wood. The nose brings cranberry, bramble, smoked meats over a pit fire, stewed apple, Worcestershire sauce, and damp sphagnum. The taste is silky, displaying an array of citrus and red berry fruits. It’s amazingly gentle and tender given the strength. Water brings cider apples, ginger, and spices with a finish of bubblegum and boiled mint candies. €90"
3594,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Glenrothes Select Reserve, 40%<review>The first non-vintage Glenrothes in recent memory, allowing the distillery more flexibility in cask selection when making a bottling. True to Glenrothes, this expression is mouth-coatingly malty, with well-integrated bright fruit notes, creamy vanilla, praline and honey. Nutty, delicately spicy finish. 
"
3595,"<price>21000<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Generations: Glenlivet 70 year old, 45.9%<review>You would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular, dense, and wooded. Not here. The nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. In time, there’s candle wax, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather, even the whiff of a soft mink stole. Concentrated and complex. The palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness, quince and medlar, and subtle peat. Hugely expressive on the palate, with a sweet finish. Truly remarkable."
3596,"<price>4664<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfiddich Over 38 year old, 40%<review>Surprisingly pale (you see the issue, Macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China, but may be given a wider release. £3,000"
3597,"<price>382<rating>92<whiskey>The Glenturret Jamieson's Jigger Edition, 43.1%<review>At 29 years old this single cask is one of the best releases to date from the Perthshire distillery. The nose offers geraniums, honey, almonds, and toasted brioche, while the palate is creamy with vanilla, heather, a fresh menthol note, and green apples. Long and nutty in the finish, with black pepper. Drying only slightly, and spicy to the end—predominantly ginger. Beautifully balanced. (170 bottles) £295"
3598,"<price>151<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at Glen Grant) 1995, 47.7%<review>The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here, Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99"
3599,"<price>160<rating>80<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glenlivet) 1978 34 year old, 48.8%<review>Think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. Add in light macadamia-like nuttiness, a drift of mint, and Glenlivet’s signature apple — core, not green. As it opens, it becomes woodier, like a brush pile. The palate has sweet, pure, pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. It seems to need water, but when it’s added the oak takes over. Good, but a little tired. £102"
3600,"<price>345<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Xtra Old Particular (distilled at Carsebridge) 50 year old 1965, 40.1%<review>This was distilled the year before Carsebridge joined Scottish Grain Distillers under Distillers Company Limited (DCL). It brings a nose of toasted muffins, whole lemon, light honey, vanilla, pencil shavings, and a slight herbal hit. Smooth, thick, and viscous, with light lemon, honey, gentle spices, peach melba, and toffee. The finish is silky and mouth-coating; rich and luxuriant. A venerable, pleasant old grain, but it lacks the zing to become truly exceptional and distinctive. (101 bottles) £267"
3601,"<price>152<rating>80<whiskey>Chichibu Port Pipe 2009, 54.5%<review>Matured in 500-liter port pipes, the color is that of a Provence rosé wine. Young, but the oak is apparent. Though it’s slightly hot when neat, there is distinct raspberry and cranberry fruitiness, nettles, grass, and, with water, chalk. Sweet on the tip of the tongue, there are little glimpses of raspberry fool and some caramelized notes from the cask, but it’s not yet fully integrated. £95"
3602,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Woodinville Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Good bourbon nose—oak, corn, allspice, a little sweet citrus—but some solvent notes flitting around too. Feisty in the mouth; warming, punchy oak, softer pillow-thumps of corn, and some bitter rye notes. More rye comes out as it sits. Finish is long and warm. Good young bourbon; priced like a good older bourbon. Craft still presents some hard choices."
3603,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Wyoming Whiskey Steamboat Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Aromas of dry cedar, used sandpaper, and hay mingle with candied fruit—green apple Jolly Rancher, Asian pear—along with earthy tea leaves. The wood-forward palate highlights more tea leaves, dried apple rings, apple skins, gentle clove spice, and cedar. It finishes with dry wood, cloves, and a hint of dried orange peel. A peculiar whiskey that seems unsure of itself."
3604,"<price>165<rating>94<whiskey>Amrut Aatma Single Cask Single Malt (Cask No. 661), 56.5%<review>

Fragrant, exotic spices permeate the nose, like a perfumy incense shot through with sandalwood; there’s also black currant, cooked plums, crushed raspberries, dark chocolate, and pineapple. The intensity of the nose builds on the palate, as rich flavors of lime zest, mango, raspberry jam, and dark chocolate swirl with the pull of oak tannins. The finish loses none of the tension between spirit and cask, balancing the dueling richesse of dark chocolate-covered pineapple and polished oak. (90 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3605,"<price>63<rating>87<whiskey>Oban Bay Reserve, 43%<review>An appropriately dark bottle and label are featured for the Night’s Watch bottling. Tangy citrus fruit, brittle toffee, and vanilla on the nose. Nicely textured in the mouth, with tangerine segments in cream, developing nuttiness, milky coffee, and a hint of char. Lively spices, toffee, and aniseed in the medium-length, slightly oaky finish."
3606,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Bellevoye Blue, 40%<review>A well-developed nose of rich toffee, blackcurrant, red apple, and beeswax, which incorporates a mild layer of spice. Mandarin orange shines through, quite a fleshy texture overall, with chocolate buttons, and pepper and clove stepping in from the wings; the clove and a bitter note eventually taking center stage. The flavor development, complexity, and spices are laudable, and the texture and weight are distinctively different."
3607,"<price>16<rating>70<whiskey>Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, 33%<review>It does say “whisky” on the label...followed by “with natural cinnamon flavor.” It's clear from the first sniff that this is a one-trick pony: hot, fiery cinnamon. But is there whisky flavor in there? Fireball's as sweet as the liqueur proof would indicate, and as hot as advertised, and there's only a hint of whisky character under the fire. A novelty for tailgating; probably great in hot chocolate. "
3608,"<price>32<rating>89<whiskey>Knob Creek Smoked Maple, 45%<review>Booze candy from Beam? More like bacon in a glass: the sweet smokiness invaded my dining room (definitely the last tasting of the day). Richly smoky-sweet, with a clear balance of maple over corn; like a rustic breakfast of bacon, pancakes, and whiskey! The maple’s restrained and authentic, the 45% keeps it from being too sweet, and there’s plenty of good bourbon flavor here, especially at the finish. Lush, tasty; if you have to do flavors, here’s how."
3609,"<price>246<rating>84<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old & Rare (distilled at Littlemill) 20 year old, 51.5%<review>As with Rosebank, Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, which formerly stood not far from Auchentoshan. The latest variant was distilled in November 1991 and bottled early in 2012. The nose is fresh and fruity, with vanilla and boiled sweets. Sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate, with ginger to the fore. Spice continues through the finish, with a hint of cedar. £157"
3610,"<price>205<rating>77<whiskey>Cragganmore 21 year old, 56%<review>The lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks, and while I tried hard to get to grips with this, I found the nose simply too discreet. There’s a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins Cragganmore; there’s even some parma violet, dried berries, and a hint of sulfur.
The palate picks things up a little, showing ferns, wet moss, Oolong tea, and dried apple, as well as citrus and — surprisingly — some just-lit cigar fuminess. It’s all rather understated, however. This is one of my top distilleries, but compared to the recent Special Releases and magnificent Friends of the Classic Malts bottlings, this is slightly underwhelming. "
3611,"<price>175<rating>79<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Whoop & Holler, 42%<review>This composite includes 28 year old barrels that yielded a flavor profile similar to pre-Prohibition blends. Smoke, mint, herbs, dandelion, chamomile, and horehound. Earthiness warms the palate with a slight hint of whole-grain toast. A medium finish shows a bit of black licorice. This style is so reminiscent of early 1900s whiskeys that it’s a must-pour for a palate history lesson. You just don’t taste these notes elsewhere."
3612,"<price>69<rating>86<whiskey>Talisker Port Ruighe, 45.8%<review>As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45"
3613,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Teeling Single Pot Still, 46%<review>

Triple-distilled in Dublin, Teeling’s debut single pot still expression is distinctive in its unusual 50:50 mashbill of malted to unmalted barley, adding an element of virgin American oak to deliver a charismatic quality and texture. The nose is reminiscent of cinnamon breakfast cereal, with delicate touches of melon and white grape, but it’s the vibrancy of the cinnamon, nutmeg, and pepper at this perfect proof that most impresses, taking a decisive lead over the soft stone and orchard fruit and glossy caramel flavors. Number 15 in the 2020 Top 20"
3614,"<price>53<rating>90<whiskey>Box Dálvve, 46%<review>The first core bottling from Box is named after the Sami people’s word for winter. It’s around 5 years old and matured in bourbon casks, with 24% of the composition using malt kilned to 39 parts per million. Smoky peats and smoked ham in harmony with blossom honey, lemon zest, and pistachio shells. Vibrant orange and lemon notes settle to creamy toffee and Edinburgh rock, the last drops of citrus squeezing out in the finish. 479 SEK"
3615,"<price>2339<rating>90<whiskey>Glenfarclas 50 year old, 41.1%<review>Just pause for a moment before tasting. 50 years. What has happened in the world during that time? How have you changed? What has it done to the whisky? Added a quiet elegance. It brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut, damson, even smoke. The tannins are initially dusty, but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. Is it expensive? For something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? No, it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800"
3616,"<price>164<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 56.4%<review>
Sweet woodsmoke, peat embers, Jaffa oranges, new leather, sea salt, and cigarette smoke on the nose. Orange carries over onto the robust palate, with quite pronounced smokiness, black pepper, and dark chocolate. Long and peppery in the finish, with lingering smoke and brine."
3617,"<price>55<rating>83<whiskey>Signatory 11 year old 1999 vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 46%<review>Aged in a used bourbon barrel. Rather soft for Bowmore — especially for its age — with a gentle foundation of honey, vanilla, and malt. Interwoven notes of summer fruit, coconut, lime, and gentle peat, with teasing brine and smoke on the finish. A straightforward, unpretentious, pleasant Bowmore. "
3618,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>St. George's Classic Malt, 46%<review>This is set to be the first proper release into the American market, and it's a good introduction point, with all the distillery characteristics on display and a delightful rustic peat base to set it all off. On the nose there is trademark sweet citrus and cracked pepper, though they're joined here by milk chocolate and creamed lime, and on the palate there's sweet lemon and lime sherbet, fruit cordial, and peat. £50"
3619,"<price>20<rating>86<whiskey>Speyburn Bradan Orach, 40%<review>Speyburn’s entry level NAS single malt takes its name from the Gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks. The nose is light and youthful, with malt, vanilla, and unripe apples, while the palate offers more malt and vanilla, plus dry, spicy oak. The finish is medium in length and grassy, with ginger and further dry oak."
3620,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Pearse Distiller’s Choice, 42%<review>A stronger grain distillate characterizes this malt and grain blend aged for under a decade. More forthright than the Original, with mint leaves, fresh orange, dry spices, lemon peel, and the bouquet of aromatic florist’s grasses. Enticing soft fruits are subdued by the grain flavors of spicy green herbal notes and astringent clove, although it mellows to a redeeming finish of sherry trifle and bubble gum. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)"
3621,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Bruichladdich Islay Barley 2010, 50%<review>Terroir and provenance are keenly debated in many corners of the whisky world, and Bruichladdich shows intense focus on the question with Islay Barley, which uses only locally grown grain. The 2017 release was distilled in 2010, using Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties grown on eight Islay family farms and matured in a combination of French oak and bourbon casks. In addition to Islay Barley’s ambitious pursuit of true single-origin whisky, this is a real gem for its ginger and tobacco aromas, muscular mouthfeel, and flavors of toffee, spices, and youthful oak. Number 9 in the 2017 Top 20

3622,"<price>85<rating>93<whiskey>Glenmorangie 15 year old The Cadboll Estate, 43%<review>

Glenmorangie has been growing its own barley for years, but this U.S. exclusive marks the first release produced entirely from its estate-grown grain. Honeysuckle and jasmine waft over lemon curd and shortbread on the nose, while bright aromas of blueberry and lime stand out. The palate is malty and full: shortbread with tumbling fresh blueberries, toasted almonds, and gingery spice. It’s silky, rounded, and seamless into the finish, and beautifully transformed by a drop of water. Number 13 in the 2020 Top 20"
3623,"<price>37<rating>88<whiskey>Ballantine's Christmas Reserve 2011, 40%<review>Master blender Sandy Hyslop has deliberately attempted to capture Christmas in the glass, and so it should come as no surprise to find a rich, full, and flavorsome whisky with sherry trifle, red berries, orange fruit, and mince pie filling in the mix. It's put together with grace and style, mixes well, and is that rare beast — a blend that can be enjoyed on its own.  "
3624,"<price>3378<rating>88<whiskey>The Famous Grouse 40 year old, 47.3%<review>Legendary master blender John Ramsay handpicked the casks for this whisky, and the job was completed by his successor, Gordon Motion. Puffy marshmallows, nougat, fallen orchard fruit, green cardamom, and clove; it’s like all the threads pull together harmoniously. A lucid concentration of fruit mingles on the tongue, preceding flavor advancement through spearmint, menthol, light peat smoke, and burning orange oils. Sit back as it heads toward a spicy tingle of ginger, apple, and scorched coriander seed. Deservedly famous. £2,000"
3625,"<price>64<rating>91<whiskey>Broger Burn Out, 42%<review>My, my, hey, hey. Freshly-laid asphalt and a swarm of peat buzzes up the nose. Heavy oilskins, stout wellingtons, and bladderwrack entangled in lobster pots. There is charming sweetness; a pussycat compared to the tiger of a nose. A thick, teeth-coating, warming glow emanates from deep at the back of the palate, with some roasted orange and dark chocolate. Superb balance between the peat and the sweetness. A triumph. It’s better to burn out than to fade away. €48"
3626,"<price>17<rating>80<whiskey>Old Grand-Dad, 40%<review>An odd combo of cornbread and pine trees starts this whiskey just before the grains develop. Think rye bread, oatmeal, and barley. Then it’s caramel and vanilla before a blast of cinnamon. This whiskey is far too soft and short to hold up as a sipper. It’s best in batched cocktails."
3627,"<price>49<rating>84<whiskey>Woody Creek Colorado Straight Bourbon, 45%<review>Aromas of spiced orange and lemon, cedar, bubblegum, and caramel spar with the fresh wood aromas of a sawmill. On the palate, ginger, white pepper, and oak are counterbalanced by a wave of sweetness: orange oil, bubblegum, and strawberry-flavored Fruit Roll-Ups. A touch of water benefits this somewhat simple pour."
3628,"<price>180<rating>87<whiskey>Angels Envy Cask Strength (2016 Release), 62.3%<review>No two Angels Envy Cask Strengths offer the same aromas. Here, cotton candy, honey, roasted pecan, and chocolate malt. Then a strange turn on the palate; roasted corn, dark chocolate, honey syrup, mashed cherry, caramel, Scotch ale, and cinnamon. Smoked cherrywood, hickory, milk chocolate, strawberry preserves, orange peel, and peach cobbler. What were once multiple fruit flavors now become a single cherry turnover with a sprinkle of cinnamon. It finishes medium with cherry."
3629,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 69.1%<review>No age statement, but distilled in 2000. A great value if you can find it for $80. An aggressive whiskey, but complex too, showing toffee, nougat, dates, black raspberry, dark chocolate, and resinous oak. Leather and tobacco on the finish. Masculine and exciting. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release."
3630,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Talisker 10 year old, 45.8%<review>Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit."
3631,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Rebel Yell 2018 Single Barrel 10 year old, 50%<review>Absolutely stellar opening, with blueberries, black currants, and mashed cherries complementing vanilla icing, cornbread, and chocolate-hazelnut wafers. Then it’s salt water taffy, bread pudding, honey, jalapeño poppers, and snickerdoodles. But it does not stop there: baking spices develop toward the end, with bright cinnamon notes coating the long finish. (Barrel No. 5083254 reviewed; 12,000 bottles)"
3632,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>The Ambassador 12 year old Barrel Proof Straight, 52.85%<review>Cinnamon-baked apples on the nose, with ripe banana, peach, chocolate, almond, toasted coconut, and sassafras. The palate is velvety and gentle, with burnt orange, strawberry, milk chocolate, almond, white pepper, and tobacco leaf. The finish is creamy, with milk chocolate, drizzled caramel, sweet corn, brown sugar, and leather, wrapped in toasted oak. Depth, balance, and plenty of pizzazz."
3633,"<price>85<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor The Big Smoke 60, 60%<review>Does it do exactly what it says on the tin? You betcha! This is big, and it's smoky, and if you're a fan of Islay malts, then it's right up your street. There's more to it than just smoke, though. There's stewed apple on the nose as well as steam engine oil, and on the palate there's gooseberry, spearmint, and apple pip. But as you'd expect, the peat lingers. "
3634,"<price>250<rating>96<whiskey>Yoichi 1988 single cask, 62%<review>Though aged in virgin American oak, it’s distillery character that’s in charge here; a fully expressive Yoichi. Rich, mysterious, layered, mixing rich fruit compote with scented coastal smoke (ozone, tar, soot) alongside masses of vetiver and cigar humidor. The palate is oily and immense, with fluxing layers of sweet fruit, oily peat, salt, and ink; camphor, flax seed, and in among the smoke, apple mint. Long, insanely complex, and jaw-droppingly good. This will go down as a classic. €185"
3635,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Rabbit Hole Cavehill Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 47.5%<review>Rabbit Hole’s core bourbon brand now carries the name Cavehill, though the liquid remains unchanged. The nose starts with dried red fruits, drying oak tannins, raspberry jam, and an earthy note. A palate of spiced oak, milk chocolate, caramel, white pepper, and sweet black cherry is followed by a lengthy finish of orange peel, honey, sweet lemon cake, creamy chocolate, and pepper spice. Rich flavors, creating an easy whiskey to savor."
3636,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Berkshire Bourbon, 43%<review>There’s a hot, brittle nose of sweet spice, like a cinnamon Red Hot floating in alcohol, with a softer backing of cornmeal underneath. This is a well-behaved bourbon in the mouth; no off-flavors, easy to hold on the tongue, with more corn than spice now, and a lack of wood until the finish, when it wraps in on the corn to dry things up a bit. Simple, sweet, a little spicy, and really easy to drink; a good start.  "
3637,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Rebel Yell Single Barrel 10 year old (barrel 5043515), 50%<review>With the quintessential traditional bourbon bouquet, it’s caramel and vanilla all day, with honey, oak, brown sugar, and freshly baked corn muffins following. Then pure bliss, striking powerful mouth-coating notes of crème brûlée, fried dough with powdered sugar, raspberry tarts, and maple syrup. The long finish offers a beautiful pecan pie note. Delightful to sip."
3638,"<price>51<rating>81<whiskey>Armorik Double Maturation, 42%<review>Armorik has been making whisky for more than twelve years; it's growing in confidence, and the quality is improving. There's peat in the malt here, and it gives the whisky a feisty and earthy quality. The spirit is matured first in Armorik oak barrels and then transferred to sherry. Sherry and peat is a tough trick to pull off and this just about gets away with it, with coastal brine and lemon rubbing up against wood smoke, barley, and honey. €38 "
3639,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft High Rye, 45%<review>Can you say “11 year old Old Grand-Dad”? There’s a snap of hot, happy rye in the nose, sweet corn and cinnamon banging along, but there’s vanilla and oaky dryness. I had a bottle of OGD Bonded handy, and it’s close. It’s like my favorite young bonded strapped in oaky spice, with a more mature, drier finish. I’m told this has even more rye in the mashbill. If you like OGD, get this and see what more age does. Price is per 375 ml."
3640,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>The Balvenie 25 year old, 46.9%<review>Deep amber color. Exotic aromas of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, mango). Medium to full in body, and rich in texture. The palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey, vanilla, and more tropical fruit, with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. The Balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. The older expressions are particularly noteworthy. They age very gracefully. This one is a pure joy to drink."
3641,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Old Forester Statesman, 47.5%<review>Broad, earthy undercurrents of cigar wrapper, dark fertile soil, and spice support the honeyed sweetness and vanilla of this big-screen bourbon. Overall, the sweetness is well-tempered by cedar humidor, tea leaf, root beer spice, and berry fruit combining seamlessly on the palate. Well-balanced and easy sipping. Best neat."
3642,"<price>35<rating>81<whiskey>Tullamore Dew, 10 year old, 40%<review>This whisky is in between the ""Original"" Tullamore and Tullamore Dew 12 year old in age and price range, and it also fits between the two in flavor and quality.  I thought that maybe this whiskey would have a more distinctive character to it (sherry cask aging, different proof, etc.) compared to the other two, given that it is a limited edition of only 900 cases and so close in age to the others, but it doesn't.  It's not that this is a bad thing, but rather just 'more of the same.'
It certainly is a pleasant enough whiskey - well balanced, not aggressive, yet with enough maturity and pot still content to make it ""sip worthy"" if one chooses to do so.  Rather than buy the standard Tullamore Dew for mixing (or drinking on the rocks) and the 12 year old for sipping, you can reasonably cover your bases with just this one bottle of 10 year old.

3643,"<price>300<rating>86<whiskey>Dalwhinnie 25 year old Special Release 2012, 52.1%<review>There have been three previous Special Release offerings of Dalwhinnie, and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated American oak hogsheads. Cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose, along with cinnamon, ginger, fudge, and tropical fruits. Initially oily and honeyed on the palate, with developing spice, wood resin, and herbal flavors. Spicy oak in the lengthy finish, with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5,358 bottles."
3644,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Crooked Water Kings Point Port Wine Barrel Finished, 45%<review>The nose is loaded with jasmine, orange blossoms, fresh peaches, gummy bears, red wine, grape fruit leather, and lashings of vanilla. In the mouth, it’s a mixed berry bonanza—raspberry, blueberry, and strawberry—with cherry, Red Vines, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco leaf. Though light, with a somewhat short finish, it’s well-balanced and tasty."
3645,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 64.1%<review>Less alcohol than past Staggs, even at 128.2° proof. This whiskey has always been one of the best in the portfolio, and its reputation is intact. Sweeter and fuller in body than recent releases, and not as masculine, making it easier to drink. (Don’t worry; it’s still a big Stagg, but with a smaller “rack.”) Vanilla taffy, nougat, dates, polished oak, roasted nuts, leather, and tobacco: it’s all there. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013."
3646,"<price>85<rating>90<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Clynelish), 1989, 10 year old, 61.5%<review>Straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma. Light-medium body. Nicely balanced flavors. Both the aroma and palate express notes of spices (Dijon mustard), brine, exotic peppers, caramel, and fruit. Lingering finish.

3647,"<price>3500<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 1970 vintage, 48%<review>This limited edition bottling consists of a marriage of both European and American oak. Still lively for its age, and beautifully balanced. Bountiful golden fruit (sultana, pineapple upside down cake, tangerine, overripe nectarine) balanced by soothing, creamy vanilla. A peppering of dried spice, chamomile tea, toasted oak, cigar box, and subtle smoke round out the palate. Soft and seductive. (Not available in the U.S.) £2,250"
3648,"<price>130<rating>93<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Batch Proof Kentucky Straight Bourbon (2019 Release), 61.6%<review>The nose offers fragrant orange, tea leaves, honey blossom, dried flowers, strawberry laces, and powdered sugar. The palate is surprisingly delicate, with notes of cigar ash, leather, blackberry preserves, vanilla milkshake, and balanced oak. The finish is long and rich, with dark fruit, cherry, strawberry, allspice, tobacco leaf, and polished oak. Water brings out toasty notes, cinnamon, clove, and strawberry preserves. Great depth, richness, and heat; stunningly formed."
3649,"<price>64<rating>86<whiskey>Paul John Edited, 46%<review>Edited is the medium peated version of Paul John, and will be followed later in the year with a big peated one. This will do for now, though. The whisky is once more intense and fruity but this time it plays off against a more herbal green apple note, smoke from the hearth, and a touch of spice. There’s also cinnamon—which is fast becoming a house style. Encouraging stuff."
3650,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>The Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 9 year old, 55.7%<review>Need more whisky? Of course you do! Try this then. It was matured in a sherry butt following distillation in 2005: savory, beefy, roasted meat juices, brisket bark, balsamic vinegar, new strips of colored plasticine, and chocolatey Guatemalan coffee beans. A sherried, soft, and wispy opener with a whiff of ginger, clove, plum, charred notes, raisins, and black bun: this youngster can handle itself alright. A cloying, clingy finish with heat, sweet sherry notes, and spices. Give it plenty!"
3651,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt, 40%<review>There has been an excellent streak of Islay blended malts recently, and here is another worthy contender from the Spencerfield Spirit Company. This one offers the sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, spice, generous malty notes, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds until it engulfs the back of the palate. You will be wanting one of these."
3652,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Tumblin’ Dice Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>This is a bold whiskey that meanders leisurely through a lot of flavor territory. The sweet aromas span toasted coconut, nougat, and marzipan, coupled with distinctive meaty smoked bacon and cherry cough drop notes. Cherry and red berry fruit also string through the palate, with bright citrus, chili-pepper honey, and flickers of spice—allspice and clove—dancing through the sweetness on a long finish."
3653,"<price>22<rating>84<whiskey>George Dickel White Corn Whisky No. 1, 45.5%<review>“Mellow as moonlight” on the label; the old Cascade slogan, from the pre-Dickel branding days at Dickel. This is a throwback too; from before the barrel. The nose is full of sweet and fresh corn “cream” and cornbread, a nod to Dickel’s 84% corn mashbill. Some peppery notes join it on the palate, but that corn sweetness follows all the way to the end. One of the best white whiskeys I’ve tasted, and not overpriced."
3654,"<price>475<rating>84<whiskey>Strathmill 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 52.4%<review>Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and Quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft, delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)"
3655,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Port Charlotte PC7 7 year old (Cask #1215), 63.4%<review>A single cask from the distillery’s peated “Port Charlotte” line of whiskies. Well behaved for such youth. Nice honeyed malt and soft caramel base with good viscosity as a bed for tarry peat, licorice stick, freshly-ground pepper, and cocoa, along with a kiss of sauternes, delicate pit fruit, smoked seaweed, and a lingering coastal accent. Long, warming finish. (Park Avenue Liquor exclusive)"
3656,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Noah's Mill 15 year old Batch 442, 57.15%<review>The oldest of the four in years, and also the highest in alcohol. It has managed to maintain its balance of flavors and keep the oak notes from becoming too dominant. Bolder and more masculine than Rowan’s Creek, but not as teasing or seductive. Still, it’s a great effort."
3657,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Wemyss Vintage Malts 'The Peat Chimney,' 8 year old, 40%<review>Aggressive earthy smoke, tar, fiery pepper, bath soap, and ginger tamed by toffee and ripe malt.

The palate is oak-led with red fruit, chocolate, spice, walnuts, almonds, vanilla syrup, and sliced lemon. More oak on the finish, along with mocha, dark chocolate, walnuts, and cinnamon apple."
3659,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Dancing Goat Limousin Rye, 46%<review>A Wisconsin rye aged in used American oak and new French oak, then finished in a Limousin oak solera. Heavily perfumed; incense and sandalwood on top of leather, gentle wood, and pleasingly soft rye spice. Golden raisins, white flowers, and violets on the palate, with a sweet and balanced finish. Softer and less assertive than traditional rye whiskeys, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing."
3660,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Fukano Rice Whisky (2019 Edition), 42.6%<review>Composed of whisky matured in refill American oak, first-fill American oak, and a single wine cask, this light golden dram has mandarin, zested lime, peeled lychee, summer flowers, incense, cracked black pepper, and dried grasses on the nose. With a sweet hit of vanilla, red fruit candy, spices, baked orange, and oat cookies, it feels stronger than its ABV. Busy spices under the tongue, vanilla cream, and hints of orange on a lengthy finish. (2,117 bottles)"
3661,"<price>667<rating>89<whiskey>Dalwhinnie 30 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 54.7%<review>A veteran Dalwhinnie, matured in refill hogsheads and butts. The nose is floral, with honeysuckle, marshmallows, almonds, ginger, and green fruit in time. The palate is creamy and offers quite insistent spices, with sweet orange, fondant notes, more honey, and cocoa. Medium in length, spicy, with persistent orange and milk chocolate in the finish, plus just a wisp of smoke. (7,586 bottles) £500"
3662,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>WhistlePig The Boss Hog 12 year old Single Barrel, 67%<review>Brighter, bigger, and cleaner than its 10 year old stablemate (sty mate?), The Boss Hog squeals delightedly with spring flowers, fall fruit stands, heavy spicy cloves, and delicate esters. The alcohol tickles your nose but is soft on the palate, where fresh-baked rye bread mingles with dusty rye flour and Werther’s caramels. Fruity currents rise over sweet hot chocolate before the sweet spiciness returns for a long, slow fade. Great cask-strength whiskey with no need for water."
3663,"<price>4690<rating>92<whiskey>Glen Scotia 45 year old, 43.8%<review>The oldest single malt ever released by Glen Scotia was distilled on December 23, 1973 and aged initially in refill bourbon casks, before a final seven years in first-fill bourbon barrels. Oily on the nose, maritime, with burlap, resin, ginger, and a developing fragrant note. Viscous and sweet on the palate, with honey and canned pineapple. The very long finish embraces fruity resin, salt, ginger, and drying oak. (150 bottles) (£3,795)"
3664,"<price>6995<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan M Black, 45%<review>This 2017 release includes spirit from three sherry-seasoned hogsheads and three butts, some of which had previously held a peated whisky. The nose offers familiar dark chocolate, dried fruit, sultanas, and ripe cherry notes, with a whiff of woodsmoke. More dried fruits on the rich palate, with coffee grounds, ginger, and sherry merging with subtle peat. The finish is luxurious, with smoky raisins and pleasing wood spice. (40 bottles for U.S.)"
3665,"<price>76<rating>90<whiskey>Kilchoman, Autumn 2009 release, 46%<review>This (rather young) Islay distillery’s second release. Like the first, it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. Its flavor is similar to the first release.
Once again, I am quite impressed. It’s very mature for its age, with good viscosity, showing smoldering peat, coal tar, black licorice stick, burnt dark berried fruit, thick-cut marmalade, shoo-fly pie (think molasses), toffee apple, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and a suggestion of wet sheep. Long, peat smoke finish.£47
"
3666,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Four Roses 17 year old 100th Anniversary, 55.0%<review>I was concerned this whiskey would be woody and dry, but it isn’t. (By comparison, the 2009 “Mariage Collection” release, a combination of 10 and 19 year old whiskeys, comes across much more tannic and dry—especially on the finish.) The grain influence is less prominent (as might be expected), but it is replaced by some nicely dovetailed oak sugars and spices, and forward fruit. It’s gentle on the nose and palate, with creamy vanilla, caramel custard, apricot, nectarine, glazed citrus, cherry pie, and graham cracker, spiked with subtle mint, clove, and cinnamon. Smooth, soothing finish…therapeutic even. If you like your bourbons bold, stimulating, and challenging, then this one isn’t for you. But if you want bourbon to comfort you like a warm blanket in cold weather, then give this a try."
3667,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Dogfish Head Alternate Takes Vol. 2: Palo Santo Marron Ale Cask-Finished Whiskey, 45%<review>The nose is herbal, with notes of bitter lime, lemon peel, hops, peppermint, green apple, and hints of salinity. The mouthfeel is smooth, with flavors of honey, chocolate cake, and cinnamon, plus notes of lemon blossom, confectioners’ sugar, and baking spice. A long finish offers vanilla cream and crackling bitter herbs. Light and fruity—sometimes almost tropical—with a grip of appealing spice on the finish. (6,000 bottles)"
3668,"<price>112<rating>83<whiskey>Celtic Cask Trí, 46%<review>First impression is of molten Reese’s peanut butter cups. This 13 year old single grain whiskey has been finished in second-fill red wine casks from Ànima Negra in Mallorca, however this wine cask has given the whiskey a kick in the Balearics. The grain character takes a drubbing, the nose engulfed by jam pots and loganberry. It is gentle and deliciously fruity, reminiscent of strawberry, raspberry pop tarts, and citrus groves. Black pepper and caramelized sugar to close. (417 bottles) €90"
3669,"<price>185<rating>79<whiskey>Glen Spey 21 year old, 50.4%<review>Somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of Glenrothes and Glen Grant (not to mention Speyburn) in the same village, Glen Spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous Diageo blends (primarily J&B). As a result, it’s rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.
This 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). There’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it’s new wood. 
In the mouth, there’s vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive, but for me the wood’s in charge. "
3670,"<price>27<rating>84<whiskey>Collingwood, 40%<review>Sweet, rich candy — pulled taffy, boiled sweets — with a little hot edge. Signature Canadian sweetness, but with more depth and a gently mouth-coating feel. Touches of vanilla, caramel, and some of those candy notes again, but the finish isn’t cloying. No overt evidence of the toasted maplewood finishing. Another exploration of what Canadian whisky is, or can be, that stays within bounds and makes the sweet whisky idea work.  "
3671,"<price>110<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2018, 46%<review>The first edition of Loch Gorm appeared in 2013, and it remains the distillery’s only whisky to be fully matured in sherry casks. The 2018 iteration comprises the contents of nineteen oloroso sherry butts filled in 2007, 2008, and 2011, the oldest of which are some of the first sherry casks filled at Kilchoman. These rich, confident aged whiskies converge in the best Loch Gorm to date, showcasing the expression’s trademark blend of succulent sherry, cooked fruits, and earthy peat, along with flavors of honey, ginger, sultanas, and spice. Number 15 in the 2018 Top 20

Fruit hard candy, pear, melon skin, green apple, and grassy turf smoke on the nose. It’s a big, juicy whisky on the palate with tangy citrus, pear, vanilla, and caramel, sideswiped by pepper and clove. Ride it out to discover Skittles, honeydew, and a lengthy finish of Golden Delicious apple. (1,556 bottles) Collectible"
3673,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Vicomte Cask Strength, 67.8%<review>One for the fruit fiends: honeyed apricots, tart kumquats, candied pineapple, dried kiwi, and layered spices—ginger, cardamom, licorice—on the nose. More candied fruit, grape soda, bubble gum, dried apricot, and kiwi flood the palate, along with licorice and earthy spice on the finish. Add water liberally—the high proof conceals some of the most entrancing flavors."
3674,"<price>27<rating>91<whiskey>Canadian Club Chairman's Select 100% Rye, 40%<review>Although this whisky was distilled at CC’s sister plant in Alberta, the dried dark fruit signature of Canadian Club is evident as soon as you open the cap. Elegant, but never subdued; cloves, nutmeg, and allspice play off the fruit and underlying notes of clean grain dust. Vanilla and rich woody tones indicate at least some virgin oak barrels were used for its 7 year maturation. Rich caramels soften a gently glowing heat. Complex and beautifully balanced. (Canada only) Value Pick."
3675,"<price>65<rating>83<whiskey>Tullibardine Sovereign, 43%<review>Matured in first-fill bourbon casks for an unspecified period, Sovereign offers a nose that is floral with new-mown hay, vanilla, and soft fudge. Fruity on the palate, with milk chocolate, malt, and subtle cinnamon. Cocoa, vanilla, and more spice in the finish. Relatively uncomplicated but very drinkable. "
3676,"<price>5730<rating>94<whiskey>Glengoyne 40 year old, 45.9%<review>Aged in sherry butts, which is a departure from some of the older Glengoyne vintage samples I have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. It is a very fruity, spicy, textural dram, with spiced apple, red raspberry, strawberry, plum, golden raisin, fried plantain, and creme brulee. Good grip on the finish, with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon, cracked peppercorn, and clove). I love the balance on this whisky. It has aged very gracefully. (Limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)"
3677,"<price>73<rating>84<whiskey>WhistlePig FarmStock Rye (Crop 003), 43%<review>A puzzling whiskey, with golden raisin and treacle aromas, as well as cereal and butternut squash. The palate is dry and herbal, with faint hints of vinous fruit, herbs and spices, and plenty of oak. It finishes short, with almond, chocolate, and amaro-like herbaceousness. The third batch of FarmStock, this includes 52% WhistlePig’s own 3 year old rye, along with 31% 6 year old rye from MGP and 17% 10 year old rye from Alberta Distillers."
3678,"<price>1500<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Baccarat Edition, 45.2%<review>The nose is unorthodox, but not unpleasant. Herbal, with notes of dill and potpourri, with licorice, figs, coconut, and brown sugar following. The palate comes into focus with traditional flavors of fragrant vanilla, marshmallow, and bubble gum, as well as coconut, chocolate-covered almonds, popcorn, and pepper spice. The finish is lengthy, presenting baking spice, cracked pepper, and polished oak. Unusual in profile, but combining bitter herbal notes with very traditional flavors."
3679,"<price>60<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glentauchers) 11 year old, 46%<review>A rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. Light fruit and sweet malt define the nose, with apple, apricot, and honey. The entry is bursting with flavor, centered around malt, along with honey, salt, and apricot. The mid-palate adds a touch of oak, smoke, and spice, and is extremely well integrated and balanced. A medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry, the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
3680,"<price>167<rating>87<whiskey>Caol Ila 2002 Feis Ile 2014 bottling, 55.5%<review>Restrained, ozonic, with no great smokiness to open, but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. With water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through, with breaths of the sea. Subtle and refined. More smoke on the palate, where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. Great balance of different elements: smoke, fragrance, oil, acidity. With water, real saltiness comes through. Very good. £99"
3681,"<price>225<rating>70<whiskey>Highland Park 1981 vintage 25 year old (Cask #7380), 55%<review>The sherry is very dominant and cloying, which is unfortunate. And I’m not crazy about the quality of the sherry (or perhaps even the wood it was aged in). I have great respect for both Highland Park and Binny’s, but this is somewhat disappointing for a Highland Park. Tasted twice, with the same opinion. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"

Creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine."
3683,"<price>1500<rating>86<whiskey>Auchentoshan 40 year old, 41.6%<review>It always amazes me how well this triple-distilled Lowland whisky ages. The best ones are in their twenties and thirties. This one, at 40, is still holding up quite well, all things considered. Lively, fragrant aroma for such an old whisky. Notes of vanilla, coconut cream pie, butterscotch, hay, wood shavings, sultana, dried citrus, and a potpourri of spice. Some “old oak” notes emerging from time to time throughout, with a gently spicy finish. An expensive whisky, but those who pony up the money will enjoy it."
3684,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Distillery Select 'Croftengea' (distilled at Loch Lomond), Cask #1, 10 year old, 45%<review>When compared to Craiglodge, reviewed above, this whisky is more intensely smoky, tarry, and youthful on the palate. The other flavors, while in the same vein as Craiglodge, are more reserved (or perhaps more greatly overshadowed by the peat). If your intent is full-throttle peat, this is your whisky. If you want variety on the palate, go for the Craiglodge. 
"
3685,"<price>85<rating>87<whiskey>Dalwhinnie Distillers Edition 1997, 43%<review>Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014, this expression of Dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers honey, ripe oranges, peach blossom, and creamy milk chocolate, with just a wisp of smoke. Full-bodied and sweet on the palate, with orange zest, walnuts, more honey, and fruit spices. The finish is long and warming, with a hint of peat and spicy oak."
3686,"<price>119<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Scotia Distillery Edition, 56.9%<review>This is the third single cask Distillery Edition cask strength. It was distilled in December 1996 and bottled as a 20 year old in April 2016. Coconut ice and vanilla fudge on the very sweet, confectionery-led nose, with a suggestion of salt in the background. Full and supple on the palate, with a big hit of ripe apples, then cinnamon and nutmeg. Very long in the finish with light black pepper. A Glen Scotia for those with a sweet tooth! (Distillery only bottling) £95"
3687,"<price>85<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Monster, 54.9%<review>(Exclusive to Park Ave. Liquors, New York, NY) This is a vatting of two single malts: the malty and sometimes smoky Ardmore and the always smoky and spicy Caol Ila. The whisky expresses smartly complex aromas of smoky bonfire smothered with peat, with notes of tar, olives, freshly ground pepper, and seaweed. A sweet maltiness (from the Ardmore?) binds the flavors together. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet, then the powerful peat smoke emerges, yielding to olives, peppery spices, and seaweed. The finish is long and powerful with the peat smoke again emerging and lingering on seemingly forever. A monster indeed. This whisky’s complexity demonstrates the virtues of vatting. Many smoky whiskies have nothing else going on behind the cloak of smoke. This one does."
3688,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Cutty Sark Prohibition, 50%<review>The Real McCoy! It's said that during Prohibition Bill McCoy serviced the better speakeasies with proper Cutty Sark; hence the name. If this is a recreation of what they might have been drinking back then, you can see why they kept fighting over it. This is another bold, earthy, smoky blend with oily, industrial notes. There's crabapple, smoke, bitter lemon, grapefruit, and even black currant. It would seem blended whisky is where it's at right now! Great stuff.  "
3689,"<price>256<rating>90<whiskey>Old Malt Cask (distilled at Port Ellen), 25 year old, 54.7%<review>These Port Ellen whiskies are becoming increasingly rare since the distillery closed down for good in 1983. This is a very good example of an old-fashioned Islay whisky: never heavy, but with lots of kick. There’s plenty of wet leaf, bonfire smoke, coal tar, and some earthy, damp kiln notes and brine. But you’ll discover a lovely honeyed maltiness for balance, along with tangerine, dirty martini, and cocoa for complexity. Smoky, briny finish. There will be a time when some of us will tell the next generation of whisky drinkers about the joys of Port Ellen. Mare sure you’re one of those telling the story, not listening to it. (Exclusive to Kensington Wine Market.) $250 (Canadian)"
3690,"<price>77<rating>90<whiskey>Kornog Toal Esa Z<review>Kornog is the peated version of Glann ar Mor and the whisky is released in batches. This one is the most intense, with oily, charcoally peat most evident. But what makes this whisky particularly special is a dark chocolate and lime candy heart, the concentrated pear notes, and a refreshing sweet theme that holds off the oil and smoke elsewhere. Think Connemara and you're not far off. €60"
3691,"<price>62<rating>84<whiskey>Brenne Estate Cask (Cask #261), 40%<review>What a pleasant change: a world whisky America can get hold of and Europe can't. This is a tiny French single malt whisky launched first in the U.S. This is very good, with honey, date, liquid chocolate, honeycomb, and some spice bite. But it's also very unusual, and my warning lights have come on: Brenne is released in single casks, so they vary dramatically. It's made by a French cognac maker."
3692,"<price>28<rating>81<whiskey>Willie’s Genuine, 40%<review>Willie Blazer imports 100% rye whisky from Alberta, then brings it to bottling strength at his Ennis, Montana distillery with water from the nearby Madison River. Canadian whisky figured large in the history of the West and Willie’s is a local bestseller. Caramel and rye spices on the nose, toast and plum jam, sweet yet bracing spices, a long, lovely glow deep in your chest. A simple sipper or a monster mixer with cloves, fruitcake, white pepper, and gentle pithiness."
3693,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Spirit Hound Colorado Honey Malt (Barrel No. 4), 45%<review>Straight malt whiskey finished in barrels that previously held honey. The nose is enchanting, perfumy with fresh flowers, bubble gum, cinnamon-dusted apple slices, pink peppercorn, sassafras, and salt water taffy. The honey-barrel finish shows itself on the palate, which has milk chocolate, sugary chai, lemon, molasses, pralines, and, of course, unctuous honey. So syrupy and sweet, it truly gives new meaning to “dessert whiskey.”"
3694,"<price>63<rating>84<whiskey>Berkshire Samuel Adams Cask Finished Bourbon, 43%<review>One of a series of Berkshire bottlings done in barrels used to age craft beers; this one aged the massive (29%!) and complex Samuel Adams Utopias. The beer barrel adds a depth to Berkshire’s usually brighter character, a rounded and full sweetness with rum and fruit notes. There’s heat and youthful sweetness, and a pleasing fullness that grows toward the warming finish. A nice twist on the usual bottling. (Massachusetts only)"
3695,"<price>95<rating>82<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Cask #5, 60.3%<review>This sweet, peppery dram secures Still Waters’ reputation for single malt prodigies: young whiskies mature beyond their years. Cinnamon, enhanced by mild herbal bitterness, rides waves of barley sugar. Sweetness and heat grow stronger as the whisky sits in your mouth. Water brings grassiness to the nose and cooked cream of wheat to the palate. Mid-palate hints of celery add breadth while linseed oil, earthy blue clay, and hints of eucalyptus linger in a long peppery finish. (U.S. only.)"

Opens very sweet on the nose, with vanilla, peaches, and apricots, plus allspice. More caramel in time. Medium bodied, with sweet fruits, new-mown hay, and hard toffee on the palate, giving way to spice and aniseed. The spicy finish features cloves, and dries steadily, with a final flourish of pepper. £40"
3697,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Barrell Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 024), 56.95%<review>A blend of straight bourbons from Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana, aged 9 to 15 years. Wild herbs, dried apricots, and red fruits punctuate the nose, while the palate is smooth but complex, offering spice and refined sweetness, along with notes of tobacco leaf, graphite, semi-sweet chocolate, and dried red fruit. The finish is lengthy, led by dark berry flavors and followed by undernotes of chocolate, toasted almonds, and baking spice."
3698,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Port Askaig 10th Anniversary, 55.85%<review>Lemon juice, tide pools, roasted pork, and peat embers mingle on the nose. Smoky toffee in time. Canned peach slices in syrup over woodsmoke on the palate; buttery smoked fish, lots of energetic spices. The finish is fruity, with aniseed and lingering spices."
3699,"<price>135<rating>86<whiskey>Royal Lochnagar Triple Matured Edition, 48%<review>Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts, all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks, followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose, with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves, cinnamon, oak, and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish, with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80"
3700,"<price>46<rating>91<whiskey>New Riff Bottled in Bond Rye, 50%<review>An edgy and energetic rye: fresh, grassy, and herbaceous, with orange, cedar, clove, sassafras, and gingerbread cookie. Dense and chewy, it has an unfurling parade of flavors: orange, cedar oil, berries, oatmeal cookies, cinnamon candy, pepper, pecans, and clove gum. Add a few drops of water and the profile shifts to highlight the herbal notes, along with mouthwatering oak, pecans, citrus oil, and chocolate. Lengthy and well-spiced finish. Take the time to get to know this whiskey: it’ll reward you."
3701,"<price>190<rating>80<whiskey>The Macallan 1841 Replica Bottling, 41.7%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Fresh and youthful. Citrus fruit, honey, vanilla, ginger, and a hint of smoke. Palate: Youthful and on the light side for a Macallan. Notes of citrus, ginger root, honey and smoke. The whisky finishes rather quicky."
3702,"<price>900<rating>90<whiskey>Port Dundas 52 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 44.6%<review>This 1964 distillate has a nose of rich toffee, weighty oak, allspice, antique hardback books, dried apple, cracker bread, and banana chips. A fairy tale taste of red apple perfection, as if Snow White polished it on her skirt. This ripens to encompass gumdrops and lollipops. Golden syrup, lime zest, caramel, and vanilla bleed into a conclusion of nutmeg, oak, and apple peel. An auspicious moment for grain whisky. (752 bottles)"
3703,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Peat Monster 10th Anniversary Limited Edition, 48.9%<review>Peat Monster is a staple Compass Box blended malt whisky, but this raises the bar significantly. The nose is “as you were”: peat reek, seaside, very Islay. But on the palate John Glaser's added some peaty Highland whisky—probably a signature Clynelish—to add a hint of licorice, a softer, fruitier smoke base, and through some virgin French oak, a delightful spiciness. Compass Box is in a purple patch. Again."
3704,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Glenmorangie Finealta, 46%<review>Glenmorangie enters the world of peated whiskies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that I’m complaining). Richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate), fruit (tangerine, orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry), roasted nuts, wild morels, a hint of menthol, and gentle smoke. Certainly entertaining, even if the whisky doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. The soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. Curiously enjoyable."
3705,"<price>110<rating>86<whiskey>Signatory Cask Strength Collection (distilled at Cambus) 22 year old 1991, 53.8%<review>The closed grain distillery niche is small, but Cambus rightly has its followers. The latest in a series of sequential cask releases from Signatory, this refill butt signals a grassy nose of green hay bales, tangerine, potting compost, white pepper, and almond-studded nougat. To drink, it’s like joyously biting into a tangerine marshmallow, to be rewarded with thick cloudy puffs of flavor with a peppery accompaniment.  Dabble with the water to reveal the delights of orange creamsicle pie. £65"
3706,"<price>118<rating>85<whiskey>Edradour 1999 Natural Cask Strength cask #295, 58.4%<review>Distilled on June 20, 1999 and bottled in November 2013, this expression from the Perthshire distillery of Edradour was matured for 14 years in a sherry butt. The outturn was 687 bottles. The nose is notably sweet, with jammy aromas —strawberry and raspberry— while hazelnuts and walnuts lurk in the background. The same fruit and nut notes from the nose carry over, along with sultanas, candied peel, Jaffa orange, and spicy leather. The lengthy finish is viscous and gingery. £70"
3707,"<price>825<rating>93<whiskey>Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1996, 43%<review>The latest addition to Glenmorangie’s Bond House No. 1 collection is 23 years old. The nose is sweet and inviting, with honey, ginger, vanilla fudge, milk chocolate, and nectarines. Very smooth on the palate: peaches in cream, more milk chocolate, caramel, then spicy apricots. Long in the finish, with orange rind and a hint of chile."
3708,"<price>22<rating>82<whiskey>Myer Farm White Dog, 43.3%<review>An estate white whiskey: the corn in this spirit was all grown and harvested on the Myer farm, a Finger Lakes farm dating back to the 1860s. The nose is clean and green, a focused blast of unmodified corn. The spirit is zesty and fresh, sweet and grassy/minty; easy to hold on the tongue until a final heat that fires the finish. If the finish were a bit smoother…still quite good for unaged whiskey.  "
3709,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Laphroaig Cairdeas Fino Cask, 51.8%<review>‘Cairdeas’ is Gaelic for ‘friendship.’ This bottling was aged in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing period in fino sherry casks. The nose offers lemon cheesecake smoked in peat, with brine, almonds, and oysters. Full and rounded on the palate, with stewed fruits, ashy peat, antiseptic, and more brine. The lengthy finish features licorice, tar, rock salt, phenols, and citrus fruits."
3710,"<price>80<rating>81<whiskey>Reservoir Bourbon, 50%<review>A hot wash of vanilla and sweet cloves and cinnamon, with shouty alcohol heat and a log of oak; whatever else this is, ‘subtle’ is not on the menu. Wow, is that hot in the mouth! Still, it’s flavorful with it; cinnamon candy and corn on the cob gush onto the palate. There are some cobby notes though, and a bit of mustiness. The finish is—surprise!—hot, and fades reluctantly. Doc Bryson prescribes more time in a large barrel.  "
3711,"<price>195<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 07.4 Virgin Oak, 61.2%<review>Distilled in 2008 from barley peated to 167 ppm and matured in virgin French oak casks. Sweet smoke and oak on the initial nose, with quite assertive spices. Freshly sawn timber, dried fruits, and emerging vanilla. Slightly earthy on the palate, where big spice notes continue with peaches, orange, and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively long, with cloves, licorice, ginger, and chili. Bold is the word! (12,000 bottles)"
3712,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Oppidan Smoke + Sea Bourbon, 46%<review>Sweet smoke mingles with lemon curd, milk chocolate, roasted marshmallow, and vanilla-frosted yellow cupcake on the nose. The palate has a rubbery peatiness, yet the flavor remains fresh, with cherries and grapes, roasted nuts, salted caramel, and milk chocolate. It all wraps up with the ashiness of pipe tobacco and lengthy saline minerality. Beguiling and moreish—a whiskey worth lingering over. (3,000 bottles)"
3713,"<price>108<rating>79<whiskey>Inchmurrin 18 year old, 46%<review>Inchmurrin has enjoyed a higher profile since early 2013, when the range was extended to include 15, 18, and 21 year old
expressions. The lineup also boasts striking new packaging and is bottled non-chill filtered. Orange fondant cream and peaches on the nose, with caramel in the background. Fuller-bodied than the 15 year old expression, with pineapple cheesecake and ginger on the palate. The finish is quite long, and spicier and more peppery than that of the 15 year old bottling (also reviewed this issue). £70"
3714,"<price>3500<rating>93<whiskey>Port Ellen 37 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 51%<review>This 1979 vintage is the 17th Special Releases Port Ellen. It has been aged in refill American oak hogsheads and butts. The nose offers fresh-mown grass, ripe pears, and damp tweed, before smoked fish and bonfire aromas emerge. The oily palate features spicy peat, barbecued meat, and peaches in syrup. Very long in the finish; smoky and earthy, with a hint of chili and mouth-drying tannins. (2,988 bottles)"
3715,"<price>115<rating>88<whiskey>Cadenhead's, (distilled at Littlemill), 1989, 61.6%<review>White wine color. Sweet aromas of confectioner’s sugar, toasted marshmallow, honey, and coconut. Its flavors mirror its aroma, with a pleasing creamy, almost buttery, texture and soft, gentle finish. 
"
3716,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Prizefight Irish Whiskey, 43%<review>Inspired by the Morrissey-Sullivan bout of 1853, this whiskey received a 6 month rye barrel finish which results in enticing toasty notes, cinnamon bark, malt, and vanilla. The structure is light, the flavors are delicious, and it knocks you out with malt, creamy vanilla, active spices, and a dry nuttiness. Give the finish an eight-count for its long lasting spices and good punch of sweetness."
3717,"<price>135<rating>91<whiskey>Hart Brothers 18 year old (distilled at Laphroaig) 1990 vintage, 46%<review>Bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. Smart move! It really helps this whisky. This is a soft — almost elegant — Laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). Very clean, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, brine, seaweed, and peat smoke, with just a teasing of the medicinal, band-aid notes that Laphroaig is known for. The owner-bottled 18 year old, which I rated a 90, is darker and drier, with more oak on the finish. I like this Hart Brothers expression just a little better."
3718,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>Kujira Ryukyu Japanese Rice Whisky, 40%<review>Vanilla, coconut, confectioner’s sugar, tart pickled plums, and savory meaty aromas, thanks to the koji used to convert the rice’s starch to sugar. The palate is sweet and chalky-dry, with a silky, rounded texture and flavors of vanilla, bubble gum, coconut, and marzipan. It finishes sweet with a touch of umami: vanilla frosting tempered by oak and warm nuts."
3719,"<price>138<rating>87<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glen Grant) 1985 25 year old, 55%<review>Old gold in color. Obviously an old whisky, but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft, the dried orange peel, and stewed apple, for example. Sweet and fragrant, it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. The palate is drier than the nose suggests, quite mineral, with a lacy character. The finish shows melon and mint. Glen Grant in gentle repose.£88"
3720,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>The Gifted Horse, 57.5%<review>The mix: 38.5% Bernheim-distilled 17 year old Kentucky straight bourbon, 51% 4 year old bourbon, and 10.5% 4 year old corn whiskey. Kudos for the full disclosure. This whiskey doesn’t fit in a typical American box. Hard to assess color with used cooperage from corn whiskey, so stick to aroma and flavor here. Impressive beginning of fruits, roasted nuts, citrus, vanilla, cherry, spice, and undercooked cornbread, followed by a quick caramel burst. Tasty, even better with a splash of water."
3721,"<price>210<rating>90<whiskey>Nikka Coffey Malt single cask 1998, 57%<review>A rarely-seen cult whisky made by distilling a 100% malted barley mash in a Coffey still and, in this expression, then aged in a remade hogshead. This is firm and complex on the nose with vanilla pod, crème caramel, and ripe banana. The palate manages to balance the silky depths and unctuous flow with nutmeg and a light cereal grip. Grain, malt, or something else? Who cares? Just seek it out. €155"
3722,"<price>160<rating>90<whiskey>Wolves Wally's Blend, 52%<review>

The nose indicates the partial base of whiskey distilled from beer (it’s blended with straight rye) right away, with citrusy pine aromas, as well as brown sugar, milk chocolate, almond nougat, and peanut brittle. The palate has a mineral quality, dry with chamomile and tobacco, but remains true to the lemon and pine essence that the nose outlines. There’s also dark-roast coffee, chocolate, black pepper, and tea leaf. Medium-length on the finish, with consistent lemon, chocolate, coffee, and oak flavors. (900 bottles)"
3723,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Storm, 43%<review>Treacle tarts, black bun, and polished antique furniture, with fainter accents of dark chocolate, espresso, and delicate smoke flowing freely from the glass. Densely structured palate. Initially, chocolate-coated coffee beans, then it blossoms into dried fig, date, with a developing deep, tangy chocolate orange note, fading to dusty cocoa like the memory of a warm embrace. Not to be confused with Cutty Sark, this Storm is bottled by the Whisky Shack Company."
3724,"<price>87<rating>89<whiskey>The Lakes Distillery The Whiskymaker’s Reserve No.1, 60.6%<review>Matured in Pedro Ximénez and red wine casks, blender Dhavall Gandhi’s first main release has a nose of pomegranate, cranberry, and fine spices. The red fruits come through slowly on a wave of alcohol, developing a tasty flavor of chewy toffee, with fruitcake, cinnamon, and vanilla. Water exposes a spicier character, but it’s worth experiencing this at full strength for that exceptional fruit-edged toffee flavor. (5,922 bottles) £65"
3725,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Tomatin, 15 year old, 43%<review>A new expression in the portfolio. Quite fruity, with prominent honey-tinged citrus peel, nutty toffee, nougat, and vanilla fudge, leading to a gripping, firm, dry oak resin finish. Deeper and bolder than the 12 year old expression. "
3726,"<price>392<rating>87<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1984 (Cask #6030), 51%<review>A refill hogshead this time, which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. Positively light to start with, a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. All the time, though, it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. The finish is a little short, but all in all a very appetizing example. £250"
3727,"<price>59<rating>92<whiskey>Backbone Bourbon Uncut Straight (Batch 15), 58.3%<review>Oh boy! Rising rolls, cakes baking in the oven, whipped cream, icing, citrus, and chocolate fill the nose. Then the palate confirms this tapestry of goodness with vanilla cake batter, brown-sugar butter over yeast rolls, caramel icing, and cinnamon sprinkles. If not for a backbone of beautiful spices layered in between, this whiskey stands as a confectionery delight. As it is, the velvety structure, concentrated notes, and long spicy finish make it a must-have sipper."
3728,"<price>96<rating>91<whiskey>Clynelish, 57.3%<review>There’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother, Brora. Perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality, and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. Even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.
When the malts from both distilleries are good, though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very, very good. This Clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning, its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old, and more in common with some recent Diageo-release Broras, mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. The palate is complex and attractive, with savory peat, sweet pineapple, salt, light fish, drizzled lemon, pepper, chili, and cardamom. It all makes for a big, complex, evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag. "
3729,"<price>120<rating>90<whiskey>Auchentoshan 36 year old 1966 Vintage, 49.4%<review>Amber color, with gold hues. Soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crème brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. On the palate, the whisky starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. The whisky finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland whisky to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old."
3730,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Hudson Manhattan Straight Rye (Batch 5), 46%<review>A well-choreographed interplay of rich dark fruit—plums, Luxardo cherries, Concord grapes—and deep spices on the nose, along with hints of wood char and licorice; it turns tropical and nutty when water is added. The palate is richly spiced—cedar, ginger, cloves, allspice—and silky with extra-dark chocolate, grilled plums, espresso beans, and hints of aged cigar. It ends rich and toasty, with lush oak, hookah tobacco, and coffee bean."
3731,"<price>83<rating>89<whiskey>Bruichladdich Bere Barley 2008, 50%<review>Bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. For this, Bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on Orkney. The nose is intriguingly aromatic, sweet and slightly corn-like, with a sweet nuttiness behind. It becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant, lemon sherbet, and a lift of tangerine before water brings out sakura (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. The palate is very sweet and concentrated. Remarkable. Keep watching. £52"
3732,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Blinking Owl California Straight Bourbon (Batch #3), 45%<review>The barrel shows itself up front: cigar box, fresh pencils, dried chili, allspice, and tea leaves, along with a touch of honeydew. The palate is roasty and oak-driven: chili powder, cacao, roasted nuts, and savory, salty grilled meat. An austere finish, with white pepper, dry oak, and cocoa powder."
3733,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Barrell Bourbon (Batch 011), 57.4%<review>At 6 years old it’s hard to believe this could get any better with more time in the barrel. It begins with an explosion of honey, warm graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, and marzipan. Then it’s saddle leather, pumice, caramel-covered popcorn, and jalapeño-and-peach jam spread over a flat tamale. More baking spices develop as the whiskey finishes long with a lovely salted-caramel note."
3734,"<price>127<rating>88<whiskey>Clan Denny (distilled at Strathclyde) 27 year old 1988, 55%<review>We get off on the wrong foot with that vegetal note common to certain Strathclyde bottlings. It quickly blows over to release candied lemon and orange slices, fresh-baked honey biscuits, eucalyptus, clove, and eventually some fresh breath mints. Divinely sweet orange and lemon puddings, caramelized sugars close to burning, and soor plooms. Despite the lemon sweetness at the fringes, there remains a central core of mint and clove. Sherbet lemons fizz on the tongue to finish. All is forgiven. £88"
3735,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old (Fall 2006 release), 45%<review>Sweeter notes of pecan pie, dates, sweet corn, candied fruit, and English toffee combine with dried spices -- cinnamon heat, vanilla, and mint -- which crescendoes on its long, dry finish. A nicely matured bourbon with decent weight to it. Some of the expressions in the earlier part of the decade were a little heavy on the oak, but the last couple of years have shown greater balance."
3736,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Aberlour 16 year old, 40%<review>Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits, butterscotch, and soft spices on the nose. Silky palate delivery, with honey, dark chocolate, light sherry, and cloves. Lingering finish, with citrus and allspice."
3737,"<price>700<rating>89<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1972 vintage, 52.3%<review>Lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit, honeyed apricot and plum, complemented by exotic wood spice, malty vanilla, and a hint of mint and anise. Similar follow-through on the palate, with the sweeter notes up front, full fruit impact mid-palate, leading to a dry, peppery, exotic wood spice finish. The whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive, with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish."
3738,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Arran 12 year old Cask Strength, 53.6%<review>This is the second batch of Arran 12 year old in cask strength format, and it contains a higher percentage of sherry cask-matured whisky than the first. The out-turn is just over 13,000 bottles. Fresh and sweet on the nose after an initial note of resin, with oats and hot butter. Full-bodied, syrupy and sweet on the palate, with apricots, ripe bananas, nutmeg, and walnuts. The finish majors in plain chocolate, maraschino cherries, and a suggestion of smoky sherry. "
3739,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfiddich 15 year old, 40%<review>I used to find this a little lacking in structure. Either I’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong), or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. The nose is all cooked plums, with some blueberry, stewing rhubarb. All is delicately scented, with some currant leaf, then sultana and sweet dried fruits. The palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. Hugely appealing and approachable."
3740,"<price>133<rating>84<whiskey>Braunstein Library Collection 13-1, 46%<review>This is big, bruising, beautiful whisky. It even feels thick when you pour it. The dark, tawny liquid evokes mixed peel, rum, and raisin from the maturation in oloroso sherry casks. Tipping in a mouthful unleashes a slick of dark bramble and black currant flavors over the tongue; chewy and weighty with thick tannins, it develops with burnished oak, fig, gingerbread, and dark spices, achieving a bitter riposte before it finally pitches over the back of the throat into oblivion. 795kr"
3741,"<price>80<rating>89<whiskey>High West Bourye (Batch #1446), 46%<review>Back on the market again, but with a tweaked formula (a blend of 9 year old bourbon with 10 and 16 year old rye whiskeys). This Bourye sports a rye freshness, crispness, and zing. Notes of cinnamon and mint are balanced by caramel, vanilla, and bright glazed fruit, with a lingering honey-rye finish. It leans more toward a rye whiskey than a bourbon in flavor profile. Sourced whiskey."
3742,"<price>54<rating>89<whiskey>Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit, 50.5%<review>An 8 year old from Wild Turkey’s Warehouse G, it’s classic Turkey on the nose, with a little spice, caramel, nutmeg, oak, and slight hints of lavender. Then sautéed barley, pecan shell, brown sugar, chewing tobacco, and bittersweet chocolate. An earthy oak note blossoms, with a layered caramel chew following this whiskey home to a medium finish. (Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive)"
3743,"<price>33<rating>90<whiskey>Henry McKenna Single Barrel Bottled in Bond 10 year old, 50%<review>One of the few remaining age-stated bourbons. Henry McKenna’s color is beautiful. You can hold it up in sunset light and just enjoy the russet and amber hues reflecting. Sweetness, savory, and floral fragrances followed by brown sugar, fresh-baked rye bread, and malt. Caramel and vanilla, with roasted pine nuts and spice, and a slight hint of strawberry lead to a long and savory finish. Balance is the point of this sipper."
3744,"<price>348<rating>83<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 25 year old, 46%<review>A stunningly lovely nose: all sweet, rounded, and layered with exotic tropical fruits, scented woods, wax, and perfume. Water makes it oilier and more waxy in nature. Sadly though, the oak has taken charge on the palate, making it more grippy and nutty. Worth a long sniff though! £228"
3745,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1974 Vintage, 29 year old, 43%<review>Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber gold Aroma: Full and creamy. Floral, honey, fruit gum drops. Palate: Rich and mouth-coating. Clean. Nicely balanced. Notes of vanilla, honey, and assorted fruits up front, followed by spicy oak notes, with a dried fruit finish. 
"
3746,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Coppersea Excelsior Bourbon, 48%<review>Fresh grains and sawn oak on the nose, with some green grass and stalks. Spicy, fresh flavors of corn and oak, along with a doughy softness that contrasts with the 48% ABV heat. There’s a somewhat bosky note of leaves and duff, a salty cracker component, and a medicinal hint; the almost herbal complexity I’ve come to expect from Coppersea. Interesting, tasty, well off the beaten bourbon path."
3747,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch #61), 60.8%<review>A’bunadh is matured entirely in Spanish oak oloroso butts, non-chill filtered, and bottled at cask strength. This edition is very rich, with dark berry notes on the nose, hazelnuts, caramel, cinnamon, and orange fondant creams. The palate is full and supple, with polished oak, honey, new leather, raisins, prunes, and a hint of cloves. Very long in the finish, with plain chocolate, black pepper, fruity spices, and oak."
3748,"<price>135<rating>88<whiskey>Royal Brackla 16 year old, 40%<review>As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
Richer and more complex than its younger sibling, with waxy peel, glacé cherries, sherry, sultanas, and custard. Silky smooth in the mouth, with marshmallows, milk chocolate, medium-sweet sherry, and stem ginger. Tingling spices allied to darkening chocolate and a touch of smoke in the medium to long finish. Finally, a fat, buttery note."
3749,"<price>500<rating>92<whiskey>William Heavenhill 225th Anniversary Edition, 63.8%<review>Aged for 225 months (18 years, 9 months). Only 225 bottles available, and only at one location: Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown, KY. This is a lot of money for a bourbon, but if you do buy a bottle, you’re going to enjoy it. It’s spicy (especially on the nose), with cinnamon bark, spearmint, and nutmeg. The spice is balanced by an array of sweeter fruit notes (bramble, ripe orchard fruits), vanilla custard, fig, molasses, cola, and charcoal. Soft on the finish. Very polished and well-balanced. It’s much more mellow when compared to Heaven Hill’s other recent ultra-premium release, Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old.

3750,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Low Gap Whiskey (American Craft Whiskey Distillers), 42.7%<review>Distilled from “malted Bavarian hard wheat” on the still formerly used at Germain-Robin. Good pedigree; does it deliver? Bread/flour in the aroma, like a fresh bag of flour, with a fruity alcohol edge to it, the wheat tang I know from beer. In the mouth, it comes through as bread and crackers. It’s somewhat hot, but it’s a brandy/aromatic heat: vapor-producing. The finish pulls more grain in, finally. They’re aging some of this; should be a great whiskey."
3751,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Barterhouse 20 year old, 45.1%<review>Surprisingly lacking in oak intensity, given its age. Very creamy and soothingly sweet, with notes of honeyed vanilla, crème brûlée, sultana, orange creamsicle, peach cobbler, and a subtle array of tropical fruit. Soft and mellow on the finish. It’s very easy-drinking and should be enjoyable under most moods and circumstances."
3752,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Rock Town 5th Anniversary Arkansas Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Aged for 4 years and bottled in bond, this bourbon has a mash of Arkansas grown grains, including 73% corn, 9% wheat, and 18% barley. Dark amber in color, a robust nose spotlights cinnamon, oak, and black pepper. The palate is an enjoyable journey from sweet caramel corn to spicy cinnamon and oak. Cinnamon is the star in the mid-palate, where it’s well supported by the underlying alcohol. A long and slightly dry finish caps off a craft whiskey done right."
3753,"<price>750<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie Grand Vintage Malt 1991, 43%<review>Influenced by a final decade spent in oloroso sherry and Burgundy casks. The nose offers orange segments dipped in honey, plus nougat, icing sugar, and more piercing citrus notes. The palate is supple, with milk chocolate and orange juice, joined by damsons and wood spices. A mouth-drying note persists behind juicy fruits, with aniseed and black pepper. The finish yields peaches dipped in salt and spicy oak. Collectibles"
3754,"<price>60<rating>78<whiskey>Bruichladdich 'Waves', 46%<review>Only moderately peated (15ppm phenol), but a consistent influence. Quite fresh: reminds me of a walk around a traditional distillery, with notes of steeping barley, kiln smoke, and youthful spirit. A subtle, intriguing thread of gin botanicals (especially citrus peel) weaves its way through the palate. Otherwise, the smoke and fruit keep your attention."
3755,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Fistful of Bourbon, 45%<review>Some pleasant warm cereal notes emerge, like Quaker oats with cinnamon and brown sugar. The palate offers peanuts and spices, however young spirit juts out, with green stick and slightly antiseptic flavors out of synch with the ample toasted oak. Blind tasted twice with consistent notes."
3756,"<price>115<rating>88<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism, 43%<review>Oat flapjacks, golden syrup, beautiful dry-roasted spice notes, vanilla essence, cornbread, creamed coconut, and flashes of mango and apple. A luxuriant feast of sweet vanilla, soft warm bread, whipped cream, caramel, a little tug of spice, with a late ripple of grain flavors. Caramel, spice, and grain notes mark the finish."
3757,"<price>40<rating>79<whiskey>Red River Single Barrel Bourbon, 48.4%<review>Light brown sugar, orange candy, and cinnamon on the nose, along with just a hint of funk. Electric in the mouth, zapping out to every corner and tooth with bitter oils and hot alcohol, with a backing wall of corn sweetness. The finish is almost a relief. Take the rattlesnake graphic as a warning; this one's not kidding."
3758,"<price>74<rating>85<whiskey>Whisky Galore 16 year old 1987 Vintage (distilled at Bowmore), 46%<review>Aged in a sherry cask, and the lush fruity notes add dimension and richness without masking the whisky’s other flavors. Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown over a campfire; damp earth, anise, and floral notes throughout, dovetailing with the lush sherried fruit. Smoky, briny finish. A well-rounded dram.

3759,"<price>105<rating>95<whiskey>Compass Box Flaming Heart (10th Anniversary bottling), 48.9%<review>A marriage of three different single malts, aged in American and French oak. This whisky shows the advantage of marrying whiskies from more than one distillery (when properly done). Vibrant, with a complex array of fruit (orchard fruit, sultana), sweetness (light toffee, marzipan, honeyed malt), spice (creamy vanilla, mocha, warming pepper), smoke (tar, smoked olive, coal), and lesser notes of toasted almond and beach pebbles. More smoke and tar on the palate than the nose, yet always in balance. Well played! (Editor's Choice)"
3760,"<price>47<rating>77<whiskey>Great Wagon Road RUA American Single Malt (release 6, batch 10), 40%<review>There is a certain rusticity here, with a nose rooted in rhum agricole, sweet malt, honeycomb, butterscotch, and molasses, tinged with furniture polish and varnish notes. The palate is sweet and candied, with Bit-O-Honey, circus peanuts, and nougat, turning a touch chocolatey on the finish."

Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads, it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2,976 bottles have been released. Leather, ginger, and stewed fruits on the nose, with smoky, dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases, with cooking apples, cinnamon, fudge, dried grass, and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade, leaving earthy, savory smoke in the long finish."
3762,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Heaven Hill 7 year old Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>In 2018, Heaven Hill discontinued its 6 year old bottled in bond bourbon that was sold only in Kentucky, but now has roared back with this widely available 7 year old. While the bottled in bond designation isn’t necessarily a quality guarantee, this whiskey more than proves its merit. It’s explosive, bold, and buttery, with warm flavors of honey-roasted peanuts, caramel, chocolate, corn muffins, licorice, and cinnamon, all accented by notes of savory herbs, cloves, white pepper, tobacco, and an earthy undertone. Well-integrated big oak, sweetness, and spice combine to create grace, power, and length. This is pure bourbon bliss, at a very approachable price. Number 4 in the 2019 Top 20 "
3763,"<price>220<rating>89<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 30 year old 1984 (cask #8005), 52.3%<review>A rare old single grain whisky from Scotland’s most northern grain distillery. The nose brings together varnished oak, clove, dried orange peel, and molasses. On the palate, an unexpectedly lush mouthfeel supports a flavorful combination of citrus, molasses, and varnished oak. This single grain has depth and character that’s completely uncommon to the category, tasting a lot more like an aged rum. A long, acidic, slightly sour, dry, and spicy finish rounds out a unique and intriguing whisky. (U.S. only)"
3764,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Dublin Liberties Copper Alley 10 year old, 46%<review>Here’s a perfect example of a bourbon-matured whiskey lit up by a sherry finish; you can sense the toffee aromas swathed in dark sherry, yielding flavors of raisin and fig. A beautiful velvety texture with flavors of cherry, dark orange, rich notes of chocolate-dipped dark berries, toffee sweetness, and wood spices. When a bitter note creeps in, swallow and enjoy the short finish of currants and mixed peel."
3765,"<price>72<rating>80<whiskey>Borders, 51.7%<review>A single grain whisky made equally from wheat and barley to keep you amused until R&B Distillers builds their new distilleries. The first impression created by the oloroso cask finish is an abundance of fruit sugar sweetness; cherry, raspberry, plus freshly picked mint leaves. This is a bold, muscular, assertive grain, where the juicy fruit is soured by aniseed, licorice, and toasted walnut. Notes of dried apple accompany a hot, drying finish. Water straightens it all out though. £50"
3766,"<price>35<rating>90<whiskey>Mars Iwai 45, 45%<review>Boosting the ABV gives this more versatility for whisky-based cocktails, but neat, there are aromas of honey, barley, exotic woods, ripening pear, box-fresh sneakers, citrus, and fruity acids, with the spices turned down low. A convoluted profile winds through vanilla, sugar cubes, and honey fudge, followed by pear, apricot, and a gentle crescendo of spice, before hitting a plateau of honey, breakfast cereal, nougat, and white chocolate to finish. Best Value"
3767,"<price>92<rating>86<whiskey>Glencadam The Exceptional 21 year old, 46%<review>Clearly sharing the same DNA as the 10 year old expression, this variant has less overt pear drops on the nose, which is altogether more floral and complex, with ripe oranges, pineapple, and an herbal note. Elegant on the palate, with orange, vanilla; and contrasting dark berries, black pepper, and oak. The finish is lengthy and slightly oily. £57"
3768,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>XXX Shine Salted Caramel, 40%<review>Appropriately caramel-colored. The smell of caramel and taffy pushes out of the glass, but as you get closer, there’s the fresh green snap of clear corn whiskey laced through it like fruit in your dessert (with an authoritative boozy crack to it). Nothing’s overpowering on the palate — a swirling, balanced ride of sweet candy, fresh corn, and estery booze — but the finish sings a clear, pure note of…salted caramel. This could teach flavored vodkas a thing or two. "

Fruit and grain drive this solid sipper, with aromas of banana, cantaloupe, almond paste, and lemon-ginger tea to start. In the mouth, it’s rounded and full, showing zingy lemon, biscuity malt, cooked bananas, and milk chocolate. Water brings out brighter fruit flavors: strawberry, lemon, and green apple hard candies. The finish comes full circle, with bananas, lemon, almonds, and vanilla. (216 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
3771,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Hudson Baby Straight Bourbon (Batch 9), 46%<review>The barrel dominates here, by design, and it manifests on the nose with fresh-cut oak, cinnamon, black tea leaves, cashews, blackcurrant, dark chocolate, and a sprinkling of spices. Savory and oak-forward on the chewy palate, which has roasted nuts, grilled corn, dark chocolate, peppermint stick, dried chile, black pepper, espresso bean, and tobacco leaf, all sweeping into a lengthy, chocolaty finish."
3772,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Revival, 50.5%<review>Driven by lovely maple syrup and sweet bread pudding, this is like waltzing into a bake shop serving up warm sticky buns—all bready sweet, spice, and dried raisins—laced with toasted oak. The body is delightfully rich and viscous, with a generous jolt of sweetness and spice that pours long and satisfying. The sweet maple, candied nuts, dried berries, and white pepper spice strike a wonderful balance."
3773,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Widow Jane 13 year old Lucky Thirteen Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 2010), 48.5%<review>Aromas of dusty basement, varnish, earthy spice, and old leather reveal the whiskey’s age, and the palate delivers plenty of complexity, beautifully balancing sweet and bitter notes as violet candies meet orange pith. Candied walnuts and butterscotch flavors leap from the folds of a leather wallet. The finish brings allspice and nutmeg, peanut brittle, and more earthy oak."
3774,"<price>380<rating>93<whiskey>Royal Salute 32 year old Union of the Crowns, 43%<review>Containing some precious closed distillery stocks, this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges, cinnamon sticks, rich chocolate, and caramels.

3775,"<price>170<rating>89<whiskey>BenRiach Authenticus 21 year old, 46%<review>The follow-up and older sibling to ""Curiositas."" I’ve been pushing for Speyside distilleries to bump up the peating levels of their malt they use for a long time because a majority of the spirits are big enough to handle the peat smoke, and this whisky proves my point. The tarry, peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight, and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness. Spanish olives in brine, dark chocolate, golden raisin, and subtle spice round out the palate nicely. Not a heavy whisky, but pretty powerful stuff for BenRiach. So nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago."
3776,"<price>95<rating>83<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Explorers’ Club Collection The Gold Route, 40%<review>Described as “an exotic mix of bananas, mango, pitaya, pineapples, guava, passion fruit, and raisins, all balanced perfectly by deep charred peaty notes.” It sort of is, but this isn't a soft, silky smooth dessert whisky; it's Rod Stewart singing Air Supply's “All Out Of Love.” It's soft and gentle, but the gravel may put off the softies, and it's far too bland to appeal to fans of Maggie May. Between a rock and a hard place."
3777,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>FEW Cold Cut Bourbon with Cold Brew Coffee, 46.5%<review>Not a whiskey: FEW Spirits cut its bourbon with cold-brew coffee instead of water, but the effect is subtle and surprising. There’s sweet green tea, spearmint gum, marzipan, coconut, caraway, and toasted oak on the nose. Mint-chocolate candy, licorice, blueberry, and black pepper vie with oak on the palate; adding water, a juicy, fruity strain of raspberry and pomegranate emerges. The finish is dry, peppery, and herbal; water brings out fruit to balance."
3778,"<price>27<rating>79<whiskey>Chambers Bay Greenhorn Bourbon (Batch 1), 44%<review>Initial aromas of boiled corncob, sugarcane stalks, and burnt sugar give a suggestion of youth and slight bitterness. Dig a little deeper and the secondary flavors of honeyed fruit, green apple, lavender, vanilla, and fresh oak reveal potential. While clearly young, there is still a lot to admire in this soft and delicate wheated bourbon, with its hints of smoke and a mouthwatering saltwater taffy finish, possibly derived from aging in floating boathouses on Puget Sound. 375ml"
3779,"<price>55<rating>93<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 72.4%<review>No age statement, but this whiskey was distilled in 1992. At 144.8 proof, this is almost two whiskeys for the price of one. In true Stagg form, this whiskey is dangerously drinkable -- even at higher strength (although you will still need to add copious quantities of water to this supercharged whiskey). Its dominant character is chewy toffee sweetness with maple syrup, vanilla fudge, and nougat. Additional notes of berried fruit, tea, spearmint, and suggestions of tobacco. Very soothing. An incredible value, considering its strength."
3780,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Heaven’s Door Straight Rye, 46%<review>Violet candies, rose petal, and lots of fresh grainy aromas meet hints of candle wax on the nose. The palate is quite pretty and pure, and delivers good intensity of white pepper spice, citrus, and vanilla cream before a fairly short finish. Does not hold up to water, but there are some nice flavors here."
3781,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Colkegan Single Malt, 46%<review>A dry smoke, led by brisket, dry oak, and cherries. Sweetly smoky in the mouth, with black pepper, cayenne, and barbecue flavors, as well as grilled fruits, nectarines, and charred plums. A good balance of sweet and spicy, with a backbone of minerality. The mesquite flavor amps up in the long and spicy finish."
3782,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>High West Rendezvous Rye (Batch 18426), 46%<review>This blend of straight ryes is fruit-forward on the nose, with red berries, grape Pixy Stix, sweet orange, canned pineapple, and shredded coconut, along with almond extract, baking spice, and herbs. There’s more fruit on the palate—strawberry, orange, lemon, pomegranate—and a full panoply of baking spices and black pepper. Fragrant nuttiness extends into the somewhat short finish, supported by oak and bitter chocolate."

On the finish, it’s all cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, mint oil, and coffee bean, with plenty of lingering char flavor."

Warenghem Distillery will release this whisky in limited quantities annually until it’s permanently available. (2,000 bottles; 60 for U.S.)"

Cider Cask Finish, 40%<review>Hands up if you’d ever wondered what would happen if you seasoned old bourbon barrels with fermenting Irish cider, then added a triple blend of whiskeys? Anyone? Fizzy sherbet, green foliage, and cider (not apple) notes, that’s what. Seasoning suggests the cask occupants are less than good mates, the cider more a lingering tenant. Pot still surfaces through the saccharine cider flavors, with coiled Bramley apple peels, citrus strands, and a nippy spiciness. Just because you can, doesn’t mean you should. €54"
3786,"<price>37<rating>87<whiskey>Grace O’Malley, 40%<review>Satsuma peel, mandarin segments, butter biscuits, dry oak, bookbindings, and hints of baking spices on the nose. Warm orange, sweet vanilla, creamy pudding, sherbet, and a mellow pepperiness on the palate, but as the citrus theme swells, a taste of grapefruit bitterness washes over it, making for a sharp, bitter finish. With its 46% malt content, this has grace, but seems a bit mild for a warrior pirate queen’s tastes."
3787,"<price>54<rating>84<whiskey>Benriach 12 year old 1994 vintage, 59.5%<review>A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they’re equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive)"
3788,"<price>58<rating>87<whiskey>Glenmorangie A Midwinter Night's Dram, 43%<review>This NAS Glenmorangie contains whisky aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish oloroso sherry casks, as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates, plain chocolate, caramel, and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth, with more oranges, plus sultanas, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and ginger. The finish is medium in length, fruity, gingery, and ultimately slightly bitter. £40"

Mellow, sherried fruit on the nose, with rose hips, vanilla fudge, almond, honey, and slightly earthy spices. The fragrant palate features an intense blast of ripe fruit, caramel, and sweet spices, while resin develops in time. The medium-length finish offers plain chocolate, raisins, and prunes, with no negative tannins. One of the best Tomatins to date."

This expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. Floral and fragrant on the nose, with honey, vanilla, zest of lemon, and a hint of salt. The palate features fresh fruit salad, coconut, and sherbet liveliness. Summery. Medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)"

The nose yields sweet resin, marzipan, ginger, glacé cherries, a hint of cloves, and red berries. The silky palate features Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, prunes, and more glacé cherries. The finish dries steadily, with slightly bitter tea, white pepper, a savory note, and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)"
3792,"<price>155<rating>91<whiskey>Royal Salute 21 year old Snow Polo Edition, 46.5%<review>With its inventive limited editions and contemporary design, it’s worth paying attention to Royal Salute these days. Its first blend of aged grain whisky has aromas of peanut, caramel, ground pepper, rye crackers, vanilla pod, fresh oak, and stewed fruits. A rapid turnover of flavors: tangy orange shifts quickly to bitter orange, followed by clove, pepper, chocolate, and honeycomb, then chocolate orange, nougat, and marzipan. It’s an even better dram over ice."
3793,"<price>75<rating>83<whiskey>Longrow C.V., 46%<review>A combination of 6, 10, and 14 year old Longrow. I was concerned that there would be too much young whisky in here (like there was with the Springbank C.V. several years ago), but this isn’t the case. Youthful? Yes. Immature? No. A Longrow with an attitude. Creamy, sweeter vanilla notes up front, with kiln smoke, sea-soaked stone, tar, anise, chocolate fudge, and apricot. I would like to see more of the older whisky in here, because it leans towards the young side, but it is still a vibrant, enjoyable whisky.

3795,"<price>232<rating>90<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd, distilled at Balmenach, 1979, 56.3%<review>Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach, Glenfarclas, and Macallan) Balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)"
3796,"<price>387<rating>94<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1987 (Cask #3829), 48%<review>This is the bomb. Savory and lightly meaty, but sweetened by plum sauce; there’s even some strawberry around the fringes. You could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the ’54. Elegant yet powerful, there’s sandalwood incense, marmalade, even a little dried mango. The distillery’s density is balanced by this fruit. Lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. From a refill butt, this is an exemplary sherried malt. £230"
3797,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>St. George American Single Malt (Lot 19), 43%<review>The nose is light, floral, and hoppy; sweet on top, with hints of licorice, stone fruit, bubble gum, and honeydew. The palate is also light, with a silky texture that offers notes of chocolate-covered marshmallows, plums, nectarines, and hot cocoa with whipped cream. Smooth and balanced on the finish, if perhaps a bit light, with lingering hoppiness, toasted grain, and cigar wrapper, sweetened by vanilla and tropical fruit notes. (3,300 bottles)"

On the palate it’s a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring, it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (U.S. only)"
3800,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice (distilled at Caol Ila), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, 43%<review>Fresh and quite aromatic. Nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” Caol Ila notes (in the sense that all the classic Caol Ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke, tarry rope, salt & pepper spice, seaweed, and olive). An evolving whisky, with a phenolic, briny crescendo that lingers. Nicely done.

3801,"<price>57<rating>75<whiskey>Lambertus 10 year old, 40%<review>This may be the best-known Belgian single grain whisky and it vies for attention with its perfumed nose of violet creams, acetone, and peach juice with ripe mango and papaya. Unfortunately, the body is lacking, yielding up a juicy collision of tropical fruits and icing sugar sweetness, but after that initial arrival, the torpid profile is rather unremarkable. The flavors die quickly, with some residual flavor trails persisting. All in all, a bit drab. €53"

3803,"<price>400<rating>94<whiskey>Glendronach 33 year old, 40%<review>Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit, roasted nuts, deep spice notes, and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005, and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can.

3804,"<price>20<rating>73<whiskey>Spicebox Pumpkin Spiced Whisky, 35%<review>Early trial batches of this whisky, flavored by cold infusion, tasted like sweet, roasted squash. However, the final version that we have here is as inviting as the nutmeg-laced pumpkin pie it so resembles. Sweet vanilla and salt water taffy fill the air, with rummy Christmas eggnog taking up the rear. Unusual in that it’s sweet but not syrupy. Hot pepper lingers, as do sweet tingling spices, but the whisky notes just barely show their presence. (Canada only) C$22"

The palate is soft and graceful, offering orange fondant, apricot, peach, nectarine, ground ginger, citrus peel, and green apple."
3806,"<price>72<rating>86<whiskey>Zuidam Dutch Rye 5 year old, 40%<review>Patrick van Zuidam uses rye as part of his genever, but when a farmer phoned up saying he had a surplus, he figured he might as well try a 100% rye whisky. Of similarly deep hue to the 8 year old, but a little more ruddy, this has a more waxy aroma, but with fresh rye sourdough penetrating. The spiciness which typifies rye here has a North African edge: cumin, cinnamon, coriander seed. The palate is less explosive and dusty than American examples; this is more of a slow-burning fuse that passes through orange and smooth, sweet oak before the spices return. £46"
3807,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Chivas Regal 18 year old Ultimate Cask Collection First Fill American Oak Finish, 48%<review>And you thought all Chivas Regal 18 year old was the same. Luscious toffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate praline, dry grasses, hazelnut, and just a lift of lime and peppermint. The palate has fudge-like sweetness, caramel, walnut cake, murmuring spices, orange peel, and toffee banana. Water unlocks watermelon and a fruitier side to its character. The spices push hard through the finish as the toffee flavors relinquish their grip."
3808,"<price>33<rating>77<whiskey>High West Silver Western Oat, 40%<review>Barely-aged white whiskey. Light, sharp fruit (brighter than the High West Single Malt), a brittle sweetness, new-make greenness. Quite smooth, even a bit creamy, with a light float of vanilla and a hit of grain in the middle. It all wafts away on a razor-edged cloud of a finish. Smooth for a white, but I'd like more substance."
3809,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Ensign Red, 40%<review>A slightly closed nose opens to pleasing meatiness, then green fruits with hints of evergreen. The palate is sweet and surprisingly rich, although fairly simple. Strong peppery spices and something pleasantly vegetal creep in. Slowly, the sweetness becomes unctuous, turning an otherwise fine sipping whisky into a mixer. Brisk spices provide a counterpoint to the sweetness, but the balance seems off. Some structure finally develops around suggestions of dark chocolate."
3810,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>The Antiquary, 1977 vintage, 46%<review>Deep on the nose and palate, with notes of dark rum, dried fruit, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, polished leather, charcoal, and a suggestion of peat.  Dry, resinous finish.  Bonus points for intrigue.
"
3811,"<price>109<rating>90<whiskey>St. George’s Chapter 13, 49%<review>In the UK, Trick or Treat is still linked to Halloween and all things spooky. So this unlucky 13 is at 49% (4+9) and is priced in British pounds at £66.60. It just happens to be the best thing the distillery has done so far. The extra strength, lots of honeycomb sweetness, and a big hit of peat make this a coming of age whisky, with no immaturity and bags of great flavors. £67"
3812,"<price>30<rating>87<whiskey>Alberta Rye Dark Batch, 45%<review>A blend of Canadian whisky with 1% sherry and 8% bourbon. Dried and stewed fruits, baking spices, leather, and earthy tobacco blanket light-bodied vanilla sweetness. Assertive dark chocolate and coffee, raisins, and prunes are balanced with sweet peppered jerky. The generous sweetness is tempered with water. Finishes like a Cadbury Fruit & Nut bar, but with more personality."
3813,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Carsebridge) 33 year old 1982, 45.4%<review>You little beauty! Maple syrup, pecan, sliced peach, and vanilla-laden bread-and-butter pudding. Soft baked-apple tart, smooth sticky toffee pudding, red apples, oozing with caramels and a fine layer of spice. The mouthfeel is silky, rounded, and effortlessly elegant. Finish of walnut, clove, and marron glacé. Douglas Laing has brought out some amazing grains lately, but this is better than ever. (K&L Wines exclusive, 233 bottles"
3814,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Mortlach), 36 year old, 1970 vintage, 43%<review>Deep amber, mahogany color. Very mature and well-balanced. Notes of maple syrup on pancakes, roasted chestnuts, dates, pot still rum, burnished leather, maduro tobacco, and subtle Moroccan spice. Soft, stately finish. Older whiskies often show an exotic side to their personalities as they mellow out with age, especially if the wood influence doesn’t dominate. This is a very nice example of the genre. 
"
3815,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Bainbridge Battle Point Organic Wheat, 43%<review>A nose of white pepper and spice, as well as salty brine, light sea smoke, and toasted wood, followed by white chocolate, confectionery sweetness, and wild berries. Rich and full on a front palate that’s somewhat youthful, led by notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, marzipan, and treacle, with lemon and almond adding some zest. The finish lingers, with a hint of salinity and toasted wood, as well as light smoke."
3816,"<price>152<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Deveron 20 year old, 40%<review>The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter"
3817,"<price>50<rating>95<whiskey>Larceny Barrel Proof (Batch B520), 61.1%<review>

Wheated bourbons, which feature wheat rather than rye as their secondary grain to corn, have attracted legions of devotees in recent years despite being relatively few compared to their rye counterparts. “Wheaters” like Pappy Van Winkle have achieved rock star status, putting them out of reach for many of us. So when we taste a widely available wheated bourbon that displays the soft, sweet, fruity profile of the style, we take note.

Larceny Barrel Proof, our Whisky of the Year, delivers on wheated bourbon’s appeal and then some. Big and powerful, it enters the ring at 61.1% ABV, but it’s no lumbering heavyweight. It floats across the palate with stunning grace and subtlety, its wheated mashbill a delicate counterpoint to its formidable proof. It begins with a flurry of sweet bakery aromas: honey bun, angel food cake, and apple pie à la mode. The palate dazzles with notes of crème brûlée, chocolate, drizzled caramel, honey-roasted peanuts, and lashings of baking spice, followed by a lengthy finish loaded with cinnamon, more chocolate, and robust spice. Water helps unleash layers of these flavors, but Larceny Barrel Proof is amazingly enjoyable even at full proof—no easy thing for a whiskey this big.

The original Larceny Small Batch debuted in 2012 as the modern heir to owner Heaven Hill’s historic wheater, Old Fitzgerald. Following a few special appearances, this barrel-proof version launched to the general public in January 2020, offering wheated bourbon lovers an exceptional treat that’s also widely available—at a very affordable $50.

Larceny Barrel Proof is released in three batches annually, in January, May, and September. Each year, the releases are labeled with a code using a letter to indicate the sequence, and three digits indicating the month and year. This award goes to B520, but you’d be wise to give any of them a try. Number 1 in the 2020 Top 20"
3818,"<price>74<rating>90<whiskey>The Blender’s Dog, 43%<review>The importance of master blender Billy Leighton to Jameson cannot be understated. His whiskey expresses smooth, creamy aromas with floral top notes; a treat of poached pear, golden delicious apple, and peppercorn spices. There’s a thick, clingy mouthfeel, with sweet barley sugar, gingersnaps, sultanas, and a peppery flare. Undoubtedly the best spicy pot character of the three Whiskey Makers series, and that warming spiciness plows on into a lengthy finish. €70"
3819,"<price>150<rating>85<whiskey>Benromach 22 year old Port Wood Finish, 45%<review>This one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. Dark amber/ruby color. You’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. Additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the whisky’s sweetness and fruit. The heartiest of the bunch."
3820,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Drayman’s Highveld 5 year old French Oak Reserve Single Malt, 43%<review>This is a highly fragrant young whisky with aromas of peeled satsumas, zested lime, rosebuds, graham cracker, sponge cake, and a trace of aromatic spice. Light to medium-bodied with sweet orange honey, marmalade, walnut, and malt, then a slow crescendo of cocoa, spice, and cereal notes to a finish of grated chocolate. (1,200 bottles)"
3821,"<price>60<rating>82<whiskey>Amrut, Limited Edition (bottled 2007), 61.9%<review>Similar to the standard Amrut, except that it's drier and spicier, with suggestions of bourbon. Not as creamy as the standard expression, but a bit more sophisticated."
3822,"<price>20<rating>87<whiskey>Four Roses, 40%<review>Lovely cinnamon candies offer an entrancing first taste, with lemon drop and orange sherbet close behind. Baking spices come on strong mid-palate, with undertones of caramel and vanilla. But what makes this special is its mouthfeel: tingly and warming the palate throughout. Cinnamon is ever-present."
3823,"<price>214<rating>93<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2017, 40%<review>This year’s edition contains some of the oldest whiskey they’ve ever put into Very Rare. A pronounced spicy nose, with sweet barley, dried apple, crisp grains, sweet baklava, and squishy cubes of rose-scented Turkish delight. In the mouth, it’s incredibly smooth and glossy; quite honeyed, subtle soft fruits, raspberry, apple, mixed peel, butterscotch, baked orange, and a hearty spice core. A creamy finish, where the spices outlast the fruit."
3824,"<price>59<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Whiskey (Batch 001), 61.25%<review>7 year old whiskey (an unspecified “corn, rye, and malted barley” mashbill “distilled in Indiana”) aged in used barrels. Maple syrup, well-browned popovers, and Canada mint lozenges in a boozy-hot nose. Richly sweet on the palate: pastry dough, hints of anise, buttery and slightly-burnt cornbread, syrupy dark fruits: complex, rich, delicious. Water brings out more of the dough and tames the heat. Delicious, unique, intriguing. Sourced whiskey."
3825,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Master of Malt Single Cask Series (distilled at North British) 18 year old, 52.3%<review>A tasty example from the historic North British distillery in Edinburgh, with a bouquet of vanilla, sweet hay, and mint ice cream. A sip made me nostalgic for childhood candies such as sherbet-filled, fizzy flying saucers and prohibited ivory-white candy sticks. I was seized by the initial lemon zing of acidic tartness, which becomes creamier before a richer, candied peel taste appears. There’s a clean, sweet finish and the mint pops up with water. Overall, satisfying but uncomplicated."
3826,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Russell's Reserve Rye 6 year old, 45%<review>Incredibly smooth for a rye whiskey (almost too smooth), but still with plenty of character to make the journey very entertaining. Notes of evergreen, almonds, and bright fruit lie on a bed of caramel, honeyed vanilla, and banana bread. Lingering spicy finish.

3827,"<price>137<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask series (distilled at Littlemill) 21 year old, 50%<review>Matured in a refill hogshead, the out-turn was 262 bottles. The nose is malty, with the oiliness of figs, plus dates and tinned peaches. Supple on the palate, with vanilla, honey, and spicy resin notes. The finish is medium in length, warming, and slightly herbal, with nutmeg and malt. £90"
3828,"<price>99<rating>92<whiskey>Glenmorangie Allta, 51.2%<review>This Private Edition expression was made using a strain of yeast found growing on local barley. It was aged for approximately 8 years in mostly second-fill and refill bourbon casks. Barley sugar and honey on the nose, followed by lily of the valley, lavender, and white pepper. Big gingery fruit notes on the palate; fresh-squeezed orange juice, vanilla, and black pepper. The finish is long and attractively earthy. Editors' Choice"
3829,"<price>5450<rating>89<whiskey>Ledaig 42 year old, 46.3%<review>This veteran Ledaig release from Tobermory distillery is the oldest to date, having been made in 1972. 500 bottles are available globally. Musty old leather, malt, and plum pudding on the slightly earthy, phenolic nose. In time the leather becomes suppler, with ripe figs and, finally, soot. Voluptuous in the mouth, with sweet sherry, plain chocolate, and soft spices, plus black pepper, an emerging note of coal. The finish is very long, with citrus fruit, chili, smoke, and subtle oakiness."
3830,"<price>149<rating>91<whiskey>Joseph Magnus Cigar Blend, 56.5%<review>This blend of bourbons includes 11 year old and 18 year old liquid finished in armagnac, sherry, and cognac casks. Toasted oak, cinnamon apples, clove, blueberries, and vanilla cake on the nose, followed by a palate of chocolate cream pie, brown sugar, and more apple, cinnamon, and blueberry. Long and rich on a silky finish, with a final note of tobacco leaf atop chocolate, cinnamon, and cherry. A whiskey that combines power and finesse."
3831,"<price>191<rating>85<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 7.2, 58.5%<review>Also distilled in 2009, this is mid-gold in color and medium weight, with a mass of sage-like smoke. More cask influence than 7.1, with smoked coconut, and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. Oily and rich, but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. Octomore in mellow mood, with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy Pinot note. Another positive work in progress report. £125"
3832,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Glenlivet Archive 21 year old, 43%<review>New packaging and new whisky too-sort of. According to Glenlivet’s whisky maker Jim Cryle, Archive is now being bottled in smaller batches, allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor. I believe that it has worked. It tastes more refined. Along with Archive’s signature creamy toffee notes, I’m picking up beautiful floral, vanilla, and fruity notes (peaches, pineapple, coconut) on the nose and palate, with subtler nutty, anise threads throughout. An elegant expression of Glenlivet."
3833,"<price>40<rating>95<whiskey>George Dickel 11 year old Bottled in Bond (Distilled in Fall 2008), 50%<review>Lush, rich, and deep from the start, with blackberry, cherry, spiced plum, cinnamon, mint, and maple syrup aromas. Even more density on the palate, which has deep flavors of cocoa powder, Raisinets, roasted walnuts, cinnamon, mint, maple syrup, and chewy oak. Extraordinary length on the finish, which carries the chocolate, dark fruit, spice, mint, and rich oak notes for minutes. A phenomenal follow-up to its 13 year old antecedent, our 2019 Whisky of the Year."
3834,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Rebel Yell 10 year old (Barrel 5043515), 50%<review>Availability and quality are two words that you don’t often hear in conjunction with new American whiskeys. But Rebel Yell 10 year old Single Barrel scores on both counts. The 2017 release presents stellar caramel and vanilla notes, then pure bliss, striking powerful mouth-coating notes of crème brûlée with a beautiful pecan pie note on the finish. Since these are single barrels, flavors may vary by bottle; no two barrels yield identical flavors. However, Rebel Yell 10 year old has come pretty close to a house style, and that sort of consistent excellence in a single barrel whiskey is an achievement in itself. Did we mention it’s available? Number 12 in the 2017 Top 20

3835,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Glen Moray Cabernet Sauvignon Cask Finish, 40%<review>The latest addition to Glen Moray’s Classic range was aged in bourbon barrels and finished in cabernet sauvignon wine casks. Raspberry cordial is prominent on the nose, with soft toffee, marzipan, and coconut. The raspberry carries over from the nose to the palate, with vanilla, ginger, and ultimately, dark chocolate. Spicy in the finish, with berry fruits and  subtle oak. Best Value"
3836,"<price>40<rating>81<whiskey>Glen Moray 12 year old, 40%<review>A malt that was overlooked by one owner (Glenmorangie) and is now, under the auspices of a new one (La Martiniquaise), beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. Its problem has been the price: too low (see Speyburn). The standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential. This is as soft and sweet a malt as you could ask for: peaches, toffee, and baked apple, with a tobacco/cedar/pine note from the oak. "
3837,"<price>250<rating>94<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve 1998, 51.1%<review>This is the Wild Turkey limited edition bourbon we’ve been waiting for. Only 2,070 bottles exist. Deep amber hues and non-chill filtered, it opens up to straight-from-the-woods campfire smoke, caramel, vanilla, fresh-baked macaroon, leather, woodworking shop, and cigar box. But it’s not a smoke bomb or saturated in sweet; its delicate baking spices meet hatch chile, cinnamon, hints of mint and citrus. It finishes strong and long with a lingering caramel chew."
3838,"<price>92<rating>91<whiskey>Teeling Brabazon Bottling Series 1, 49.5%<review>William Brabazon, 3rd Earl of Meath, once presided over Newmarket, the area of Dublin the Teeling Distillery now calls home. Clean lemon-ozone character, with peach, apricot, and melon, the sherry finessing the distillery character. There’s further fruitiness apparent on the palate; oaky chardonnay notes, more melon, and warm orange, though the strength burns through. Grapefruit and gooseberry sharpness keeps this zingy and fresh above a sweet toffee base. €78"
3839,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Barrell Infinite Barrel Project (Feb. 12, 2018), 59.65%<review>With smoke and oak, this starts off so intense with pepper spices, peat, dried apricot, hard candies, caramel-covered apples, salted butter, pecan shell, and strawberry jam. Leather, tobacco, and baking spices begin the descent toward a medium, slightly bitter finish. If you like trying new things, this is an American cadre of flavors unlike anything out there. (Bottled on February 12, 2018)"
3840,"<price>94<rating>80<whiskey>Bunnahabhain ‘Over 12 year old’ Feis Ile 2012 bottling, 54.3%<review>Light gold in color, the roasted almond notes that start the nose show the influence of the amontillado sherry finish before your nose is filled with the contents of a spice merchant’s chest alongside, unusually, a light maritime note. Very gentle and clean in the mouth with sour plum and a generally amenable nature. More like this please, Burn Stewart! £60"
3841,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Abraham Bowman Port Finished Bourbon, 50%<review>One of the debut whiskeys at WhiskyFest New York 2012, this was finished in a barrel that held Virginia-made port…after it was used to age Bowman whiskey, a boomerang finish. The nose gives baking chocolate, tropical flowers, and yes, some of that port. Peppery and port-edged on the tongue, solid fire from the 100 proof, fat corn and fruit in the middle of the palate. Busy, but purposeful. There’s a lot here and it’s all working together.  "
3842,"<price>73<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2017-04 “Sip Awhile,” 64.05%<review>Rosewater, almond extract, dark cherries, roasted almonds, and caramelized sugar start this truly splendid aromatic whiskey. Marzipan, pecan pie, chocolate Moon Pie, Bavarian cream, butterscotch, and fried dough with powdered sugar follow. This remarkable whiskey finishes long and strong with more fried dough."
3843,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Ohishi Port Cask-Finished (2020 Release), 42.4%<review>
Baked oat cookie, walnut, allspice, and a hint of rosehip, though the aromas become quite spicy in time, crackling with ground ginger and pepper. The palate has a mouth-drawing, heavy texture and tastes joyously like a liquid toffee apple after two years in the port cask. Supported by flavors of cake mix, sultana, and gentle spices, it has a dry finish of fading fruit and chocolate cake. (1,490 bottles)"
3844,"<price>145<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Salted Caramels (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991, 46%<review>Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. The finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90"
3845,"<price>45<rating>75<whiskey>Tullamore Dew Single Malt Sherry Cask Finish, 46%<review>It's great that Irish whiskey is thriving and William Grant has bought Tullamore Dew. But they need help. To paraphrase English football fans, someone doesn't know what he's doing. The label says this is 12 years old, small batch, and limited edition. What? The normal whiskey is a blend and there's no distillery. So what is this, and why small batch? The whiskey's a mess, too — flabby, characterless, and confused — the whiskey equivalent of a karaoke singer doing Led Zeppelin.  "
3846,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>Glenmorangie Astar 2017, 52.5%<review>The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet, even sugary fresh fruit notes, plus vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)"
3847,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Maison Benjamin Kuentz Fin de Partie Single Malt, 46%<review>Distilled at Lorraine’s G. Rozelieures, this whisky from an erudite and cultivated independent bottler has a nose of peach, orange buttercream, asphalt, toasted oak, and black peppercorn. On the palate there is citrus, vanilla, and spice, developing more tangy flavors of candied peels, orange buttercream, and ground pepper. As it softens, a little smoke curls around a taste of taffy candy. Hot smoke, spice, and diminishing citrus notes signify game over. (1,0000 bottles)"
3848,"<price>153<rating>81<whiskey>Douglas Laing 15 year old Old Particular (distilled at Bowmore), 48.4%<review>Bowmore in unusually oily guise here, with linseed oil, hot seashells, background water mint, completely integrated smoke, and a cooling note that brings to mind a lido (without any chlorine, I hasten to add). The palate has a limey lift which flows into a quite thick, creamy/oaty mid-palate, with the smoke bedding itself on the tongue. Smoky and mineralic on the finish. Water makes it even more gentle. A light expression for the early morning. £98"
3849,"<price>25<rating>79<whiskey>Old Forester Repeal Bourbon, 50%<review>A more significant oak impact when compared to the standard Old Forester bourbons, which is evident by the polished leather, tobacco, and dry resin notes (especially on the finish). There’s an attempt to balance all this wood with notes of dusty corn, coconut, mint, vanilla, juniper, and dark berried fruit (blueberry, black raspberry, black cherry), but I don’t think it quite gets there. This bourbon is a nice change of pace (and I understand the reason behind this whisky -- to emulate bourbons from the era of Repeal), but I prefer the Old Forester “Signature” 100 proof to this whiskey. I’m happy drinking the whiskeys of today, thank you. (Price is per 375 ml.)"
3850,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Hillrock Double Cask Rye (Barrel No. 19), 45%<review>Rye spice is the first thing on the nose: cinnamon-spiked hard candy, hot and juicy. Beautifully oily and bitter rye character slides across the tongue on a wave of sweet caramel and vanilla. Young, but in the eager intensity of rye, not the clumsy heat of bourbon. Rye shines here, from the first whiff to the last bitter curl on the tongue, and the wood deftly sweetens and soothes. Nicely done."
3851,"<price>20<rating>77<whiskey>Chicken Cock Root Beer Flavored Whiskey, 43%<review>Root beer (wintergreen, sugar, a bit of cinnamon) and oak on the nose; whiskey/oak predominates. There’s actually a lot of whiskey flavor here, too, though it’s not great whiskey, the finish gets sweet and clingy, and the mix seems forced. Still…root beer-flavored whiskey? In an aluminum bottle? Why not just buy some whiskey and put it in your root beer? Then when you come to your senses, you can drink the whiskey like a civilized human."
3852,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Hart Brothers (distilled at Inchgower), 26 year old, 1976 vintage, 49.9%<review>A coastal Speysider, and this is evident in many of the Inchgower bottlings, including this one. This is quite a fruity dram, with notes of tangerine, lemon, and kiwi. Soft vanilla, coconut, and honey play in the mix, with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. Very clean, light, and surprisingly reserved in oak notes, considering its age. 
"
3853,"<price>69<rating>87<whiskey>The Dalmore Tay Dram, 40%<review>Comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks, the Tay Dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose, with fruit and toffee. Fuller bodied than the Tweed or Dee Drams, with more overt evidence of sherry, followed through by honey, almonds, coffee, and toffee. Dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 Currently not available in the U.S."
3854,"<price>29<rating>88<whiskey>Forty Creek Copper Pot Reserve, 43%<review>This “amped-up” version of John K. Hall’s signature Barrel Select is not so much better as it is bigger and bolder. Cloves, ginger, and cinnamon burst over creamy rich butterscotch and searing red pepper, restrained only by dry rye grain and bitter orange. The initial fireworks complete, figgy dark fruit and nutty milk chocolate swirl capriciously over fragrant spring flowers, soft vanilla, and delicate herbal maple syrup. Dramatic and delightful. "
3855,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>Alfred Giraud Harmonie, 46.1%<review>The peated sibling to Heritage generates a nose of woodsmoke, incense sticks, oiled leather, and peppercorns. This has a thick mouthfeel of honey, peat smoke, and spiced pears. The spices put on quite a show to keep the fruits at bay, but when it settles down, the common theme of pears in cream comes through in the end. The spices return to harangue the tongue in the finish. (225 bottles for the U.S.)"
3856,"<price>123<rating>86<whiskey>Arran Smugglers’ Series Vol. 1 The Illicit Stills, 56.4%<review>Illicit Stills is the first in a trilogy of limited releases reflecting Arran’s distilling heritage. It includes unpeated Arran spirit, some of which has been aged in port pipes, along with amounts of medium-peated and heavily-peated whisky. Warm and rounded on the oily nose; figs and peat, before caramel and vanilla develop. Viscous in the mouth, with succulent orange and spicy peat. The finish is very long and peppery, with mouth-drying tannins. £85"
3857,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Old Pulteney 12 year old, 40%<review>Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery, located in the historic port of Wick, is owned by Inver House. The ‘entry level’ 12 year old expression is widely available. The nose presents pleasingly fresh malt and floral notes, with a touch of pine. The palate offers a fuller bodied, sweeter whisky than the nose might lead one to expect, with more malt, spices, fresh fruit, and a suggestion of salt. The finish is medium in length, drying, and decidedly nutty."
3858,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Hyde No. 3 The Áras Cask 6 year old, 46%<review>If you were expecting a young, grainy aroma, you would be much mistaken. Multi-layered nose of fudge, vanilla, pecan cookies, soda bread, and Ice Breakers mints. Ethereal and soft array of creamy vanilla, pear, fruity hard candy, and greengage, before a groundswell of pepper, star anise, and clove. Evolving juicier, tropical fruit notes risk being swamped in spice. The dough, gingersnaps, and hot finish remind us it’s grain. Hyde? Go seek. (5,000 bottles)"
3859,"<price>130<rating>86<whiskey>Chieftain’s (distilled at Bruichladdich) 22 year old 1989, 51.4%<review>A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich, with honeyed malt, vanilla pod, charcoal, exotic fruit, and dark chocolate bourbon balls, teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile, leather finish. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)"
3860,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Jura Seven Wood, 42%<review>Part of the Jura range exhibiting ‘sweetness and smoke.’ This was aged in first-fill American oak barrels and finished in six different types of French oak casks. Nutty on the nose, with freshly sawn wood, savory notes, and emerging ripe peaches. Very fruity on the palate, with tangerines, fudge, cinnamon, and toasted oak. Drying in the finish, with nutmeg."
3861,"<price>33<rating>85<whiskey>Famous Grouse Mellow Gold, 40%<review>This has enticing flavors that will meet with the approval of the regular Grouse drinker: heady florals with fresh peach, light honey, pecan, and underlying caramel. The palate is soothing with vanilla and tangerine, hallmarks of Grouse, plus rosewater, almond, and whispering spices. Gently does it, that’s the key to this: kick back and relax. This showcases the Midas touch of Gordon Motion’s skills in liquid alchemy. A great value blend to boot. £22"
3862,"<price>108<rating>84<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Spiced Chocolate Cup (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 46%<review>This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67"
3863,"<price>170<rating>88<whiskey>Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Caol Ila), 1984 vintage, 50%<review>Bottled in 2004 and still in circulation. A very traditional Caol Ila. Not a heavy-bodied whisky, but it throws a strong punch. Notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine, all on an oily, malty, vanilla foundation. Throw in some orchard fruit, Manzanilla olive, black licorice stick, and soot, with brine and Tellicherry pepper on the finish. Clean, fun, and dynamic.
"
3864,"<price>60<rating>96<whiskey>Redbreast 12 year old, 40%<review>Very elegant, complex, and stylish. Honeyed and silky in texture, with toffee, toasted marshmallow, nougat, maple syrup, banana bread, and a hint of toasted coconut. Bright fruit and golden raisin blend in nicely with the layers of sweetness. Impeccable balance and very approachable. Classic Irish whiskey! (Value Pick)"
3865,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Ohishi Sakura Cask Rice Whisky (2019 Release), 43.6%<review>Rich amber in color, with aromas of fermented fruits, toasted oak, apple peelings, old parchment paper, golden pancakes, and bright aromatic chili flakes and paprika. A soft, gentle dram that caresses the taste buds with caramelized brown sugar, fudge, vanilla, dried apple, ground almond, and a tang of citrus peel. On the finish, the flavor of apple peelings returns after a brief glow of spice. (1,475 bottles)"
3866,"<price>71<rating>90<whiskey>GlenDronach Cask Strength (Batch 6), 56.1%<review>The latest batch of cask strength GlenDronach should make Aberlour a’bunadh look to its laurels. It is matured in a combination of Pedro Ximenez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is quite perfumed, with sweet sherry, figs, nutmeg, satsumas, and candied peel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with early bright fruit notes, cinder toffee, and caramel, followed by darker sherry and raisin notes. Lightly peppery and tannic, with plain chocolate. £55"
3867,"<price>47<rating>94<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, 14 year old, Fine Grain Oak, 45%<review>Aged in slow-growth wood. I love the balance in this whiskey, with all the flavors presented harmoniously. Rather lively for a bourbon approaching 15 years. Notes of bright fruit (peach, kiwi, golden raisin), soft vanilla, crème caramel, lemon meringue, and coconut macaroon, then drying out nicely to a rather sophisticated, cinnamon-tinged, polished oak finish."
3868,"<price>63<rating>79<whiskey>Roughstock Montana Whiskey, 45%<review>An odd touch of the roasted-grain smell of the dryhouse here, then youthful whiskey underneath it: sweet, mint, barrel. Flavors tumble across the tongue: cocoa, mint, coconut, grass, and a bit of spice. This is six months in the barrel, and it's good for that; I also like that it's all Montana-grown grain. But you have to wonder what it will be like after another four years. "
3869,"<price>141<rating>89<whiskey>Teeling Revival Volume IV 15 year old, 46%<review>Part of a series of innovative wine finishes marking the revival of distilling in Dublin. The fourth release spent a year finishing in sweet, aromatic Muscat casks, imparting the bouquet of a rose garden, with ripe peach, satsuma peel, peppercorn, and black cardamom. Syrupy sweet wine notes, canned peach slices, vanilla cream, ginger root, and pepper make this attractive and unique among Irish whiskeys. (12,500 bottles) €120"
3870,"<price>165<rating>91<whiskey>Mars Komagatake Double Cellars Japanese Single Malt (2019 Release), 47%<review>Distilled at the Shinshu distillery in Nagano, and matured both there and at the aging cellar on Yakushima Island, this whisky has a compelling balance of cask influences. Aromas of honey, cherry gummy bears, red apple, heady floral scents, banana muffin, vanilla essence, menthol, and feisty aromatic spices. The palate takes a journey through honey, grapefruit, lime zest, Honey Smacks cereal, red apple, playful spices, then more sherry fruit matched by ginger, clove, and pepper. (3,659 bottles)"
3871,"<price>66<rating>85<whiskey>Broger Triple Cask, 42%<review>Austria now boasts more than a dozen distilleries. Combining maturation in fresh bourbon, sherry, and Madeira casks can help younger whiskies like this to combine different flavors. The Madeira and sweet sherry dominate the nose initially, but there are dried cherry, fresh fig, marzipan, and shelled pistachio too. It’s a smooth, light to medium-weight dram with good maltiness, ground almond, latte, dry sherry, milk chocolate, apple, and baked pears. The long finish leaves raisins and a coffee-bean intensity. €48"
3872,"<price>885<rating>90<whiskey>Hakushu 25 year old, 43%<review>As the price may suggest, there ain’t a lot of this around, but to see Hakushu at its most robust, try and find a bar with a bottle. Again, the sherry component has been upped, as has the smoked element. There is, however, always that graceful Hakushu purity running through, this time expressed as rhubarb and strawberry. The palate shows great oily depth, hints of walnut, and yes, a sprig of mint tying it to the 10 year old. £555"
3873,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Port Cask, 59.4%<review>Admirably, they go to all the trouble of bottling single casks individually for their Solist range at Kavalan Distillery. This single cask has the most gorgeous, deep ruby color and a very fruity nose: pomegranate, fresh orange, plum, walnut jam, macadamia, and some zestier elements. At full strength, it’s mouth drawing; warm, fruity, with stewed plums, young rhubarb, pepperpots, and fine-quality dark chocolate. A clean finish, with the fruit and wood spices remaining fresh to the end. (181 bottles) NT$3,500"
3874,"<price>145<rating>88<whiskey>The Singleton of Dufftown 17 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2020), 55.1%<review>
This is the first release of Singleton of Dufftown to be matured solely in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is slightly earthy, with developing barley sugar and green fruits. The supple palate offers honey, sweet orange, walnuts, and soft spice. The finish is peppery, with crystallized ginger and a hint of dark chocolate."
3875,"<price>92<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glen Garioch) 17 year old, 46%<review>Distilled in September 1995 and matured for 17 years in a refill hogshead, this bottling of the Aberdeenshire malt Glen Garioch
offers a nose of fresh peaches and vanilla, followed by a sprinkling of chili powder, and even a suggestion of boiled ham. Voluptuous in the mouth, with summer fruits, toffee apples, and a significant amount of ginger. The finish
dries quite rapidly, with fruity spices. £60"
3876,"<price>133<rating>81<whiskey>Lagavulin Feis Ile 2012 Bottling 1998 Vintage (Cask No. 1716), 55.1%<review>At first I wondered what was going on here. This Lagavulin has more of the austerity typical of Port Ellen. There’s a tense minerality on the nose giving the impression of salty rock-pools and samphire. Water makes it sweeter and oyster-like. There’s big delivery on the tongue, with masses of distillery character, but that tension remains to the saline finish. In a head-to-head with Caol Ila, the former wins hands down. £85"
3877,"<price>1000<rating>93<whiskey>The Glenrothes “John Ramsay,” 46.7%<review>Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks, distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty, with honeyed citrus, juicy oak, chocolate fudge, and nougat. More subtle floral notes, licorice (red and black), ginger, and chamomile tea. Polished oak on the finish balances the sweetness. A great whisky to honor a great whisky maker! (Only 200 bottles for the U.S.)"
3878,"<price>30<rating>82<whiskey>The Speyside, 12 year old, 43% ABV<review>A relative newcomer to the Scotch whisky industry, having just turned 12. And over the past decade, we’ve had plenty of opportunity to watch this whisky mature, as it was first bottled after a few years as Drumguish, and then under the Speyside name as an 8 year old and 10 year old before this 12 year old expression. This whisky continues to develop with age. The foundation of this particular bottling is a generous serving of toffee, nuts, and vanilla fudge. Fruity, golden raisin and peach notes provide contrast, with toffee and subtle oak on the finish. Whisky for dessert, anyone? 
"
3879,"<price>77<rating>95<whiskey>Method and Madness Single Pot Still Whisky Finished in French Chestnut, 46%<review>The thicker, air-dried staves of Castanea sativa have a lower density and greater porosity than American oak. The different wood breakdown products enhance the pot still style, bringing confectionery sweetness, dark prunes, and effusive lighter spices. It rolls out a thick red carpet of sweet spice, cinnamon, and clove, with more pot still weight than oak tannins. Move over Redbreast; my pick from this crazy, experimental Irish Distillers range.€69"
3880,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Classic Cask 23 year old Caribbean Rum Barrels, 43%<review>I’m reminded of leafy ferns in spring, sweet melon, green bananas, fresh cream, and a dusting of spice when I nose this blend. A light, green fruit taste of white grape and melon overlaid with runny toffee and banana, before the impression of thick fruit skins, becoming slightly tannic. Light spices and pepper follow with a finish of apple core and rich spice. (760 bottles)"
3881,"<price>28<rating>81<whiskey>Montgomery Early Release Straight Rye, 45%<review>Beautiful little bottle and label. 100% rye, aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels. Smells right: rye spice, orange candies, and oaky vanilla. Light body, quite hot, and the sweetness comes through, but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms. Some plastic hints high in the mouth. Promising, but not there yet; part of the problem with big barrels."
3882,"<price>50<rating>94<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Aged, 10 year old, 45%<review>Aged in French oak barrels, in which the staves were air-dried for 24 months. Incredibly rich notes of caramel, chewy toffee, and maple syrup. All this sweetness is balanced nicely by firm, polished oak, and the whiskey is kept lively with delicate candied fruit and crisp mint. Dry, elegant finish. 
"
3883,"<price>73<rating>83<whiskey>Copper House Single Malt No. 1, 43%<review>Adnams brewery is known for two things in particular: a fearless approach to bold flavors and its investment in quality. Its other spirits are award winners, but it's going to have to wait a little longer to repeat the trick with its single malt. This is just 3 years old and while it’s extremely well made and the maturation in virgin French oak ensures tastiness, spice, and sweet soft vanilla, it hasn't fully realized its potential. £44"
3884,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Toiteach A Dhà, 46.3%<review>Toiteach A Dhà means ‘smoky two’ in Gaelic and follows the previously released Toiteach. The nose opens with aromatic smoke and brine, while red berries, caramel, nutmeg, and cloves develop. Significantly greater sherry wood influence on the palate compared to the last version, plus Jaffa oranges, pipe tobacco, nougat, cloves, black pepper, and smoked fish. Medium to long in the finish, with drying sherry, oak, pepper, salt, and dark chocolate."
3885,"<price>112<rating>89<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 2003 Pedro Ximénez Finish, 54.8%<review>This limited-edition Bunnahabhain was aged in sherry casks until 2011, when it was transferred into first-fill Pedro Ximénez sherry butts. The nose offers leathery sherry, red berries, ozone, and a little black pepper. Rich, sweet fruit notes on the palate; overt sherry, plus toffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of background salt. Cinnamon, honey, and raisins in the long finish. (2,154 bottles for U.S.)"
3886,"<price>81<rating>84<whiskey>BenRiach Peated Quarter Casks, 46%<review>This peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since BenRiach was acquired by Brown-Forman in April 2016. The nose offers sweet peat and new leather, coal, and a hint of iodine. White pepper and big peat notes on the palate. Ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. The finish is medium in length, warming, and gently smoky. £65"
3887,"<price>109<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Private Release Sicilian Amaro Cask-Finished Kentucky Whiskey (Batch No. AH05), 61.15%<review>The unusual cask finish lends a minty herbal note throughout, from the nose—which
is honeyed and sweet, also showcasing milk chocolate, peanuts, candy apple, maple
syrup, and a whiff of licorice—to the palate and finish. Overall, this serves as a great
example of the importance of texture in whiskey; the mouthfeel is oleaginous and
almost fatty, gliding over the palate and shedding flavors of chocolate-covered cherry,
white pepper, gingerbread, and roasted walnuts. The finish is zingy with ginger, white
pepper, and tingling peppermint, buttressed by bittersweet mocha, cherry, and dark
grapes. 
"
3888,"<price>75<rating>90<whiskey>Bushmills 1608, 46%<review>A blend of three different types of whiskey -- malt whiskey, grain whiskey, and a third component which is said to be a malt whiskey produced from crystal malt. Brewers and homebrewers know crystal malt well, a slightly caramelized version of malted barley. Its rich texture suggests a decent malt content for a blend. Layers of sweetness (honeyed vanilla, rummy molasses, toasted marshmallow) are balanced by toasted nuts, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. Very dynamic and with plenty of grit. Smartly bottled at 46%."
3889,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Laphroaig Original Cask 10 year old, 57.3%<review>Amber with gold streaks. Its aroma and flavor is fresh, powerful, and medicinal, with notes of peat smoke, band-aids, tar, rich toffee, seaweed, and brine. Thick in body, with an almost molasses-like viscosity."
3890,"<price>62<rating>86<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 18 year old (batch 3), 48%<review>A delicious and inviting proposition, this offers heather honey on toast, marmalade, dark vanilla, and flapjack aromas. Soft on the palate, there are gingersnaps dipped in thick-cut marmalade and runny caramels, though the ginger flavor muscles its way to the fore eventually. Water promotes more candied peel, before a spearmint conclusion. This is really enjoyable whisky for those lucky enough to get their hands on it. (30 bottles) £50"
3891,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Lock Stock & Barrel 13 year old, 50.65%<review>Beautifully boxed for gift giving, a quality that carries over into the whiskey itself. Fresh-cut red cedar unfolds into hard candy, green apples, nail polish, rye bread, and ripe black cherries on the nose. Vague cedar on the palate becomes fruity and floral, then hot and spicy. Distant licorice root is restrained by German rye bread. Earthy but not dusty, with a sweet, hot, effervescent spiciness. Fades in a long, tingling finish. Complex and expressive: rich yet ethereal."
3892,"<price>123<rating>86<whiskey>Bruichladdich 2001 15 year old (2016-1881-135-PHD), 50%<review>The official Fèis Ìle  2016 bottling. This is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. The finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element, but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through, alongside baked apples, coconut, and a touch of smoke. The alcohol burn is negligible, allowing more estery elements, melon, and red fruits to come through. A classic Laddie, in other words. (1881 bottles) £95"
3893,"<price>72<rating>91<whiskey>Mackmyra Jaktlycka, 46.1%<review>This seasonal whisky’s name translates to “happy hunting” and evokes the Swedish love of foraging for berries in the forest. The complex recipe involves a component whisky filled into a variety of casks seasoned with Grythyttan Vin’s lingonberry and blueberry wine. Fragrant nose, with soft white fruits, grasses, and root ginger, with flavors of blueberry, honey, dried peel, and a fireworks extravaganza of spices before a cashew and hazelnut finish. SEK599"
3894,"<price>218<rating>92<whiskey>Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy, 46%<review>Like the man himself, this is altogether more considered and elegant, mixing whiskeys up to 25 years old for a complex and less bruising experience than the Powers. Instead, lemon and lime zest, kumquat, and blood orange entwine themselves around vanilla, nutmeg, and soft, drying tannins. No big knockout punches, but it goes the distance and wins unanimously and easily on points. €160 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
3895,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Kavalan Bourbon Oak, 46%<review>Surprise, surprise. This is like the school's best pitcher, who then steps onto the football team and throws for a game-winning touchdown. This is a whole new side to Kavalan. Remember Faith No More doing “Easy”? Having out-sherried and out-bourboned us with kickass rock-n-roll whisky, Kavalan goes for gentle and croony, with vanilla and honey. The coup de grace? Apple pie and cream morph into licorice and menthol. Exquisite. "
3896,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Stranahan’s “Yellow Label” Colorado Single Malt, 47%<review>While the aroma is tightly wound at first, it gradually reveals layers of brown sugar and warming spice, apple and pear fruits woven through with opulent toasted oak. The palate entry is soft and rounded but quickly picks up steam, with layers of biscuity malt, peppercorns, blackberry fruit, and a lovely salted butter note that brings nice balance to the finish. Fully mature, pleasingly complex, and it keeps getting better!"
3897,"<price>300<rating>86<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Dimensions (distilled at Caledonian) 1987 31 year old, 52.9%<review>Produced the year before the distillery closed, this has lemon butter, popcorn, bouquet garni, garlic shoots, and chopped cilantro ensuring the imbiber knows this is grain, not one masquerading as a single malt. Light green fruits reminiscent of melon, apple, and nectarine on the palate, with caramel, vanilla, a little oak, and a ripple of spice, notably coriander seed and pepper, before a finish of pears in golden syrup."
3898,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Aberlour 18 year old, 43%<review>This has a significant proportion of sherry wood and it marks a real step up from its younger stablemates. It boasts a stylish nose of old leathery cigar boxes, vanilla, and orange marmalade. Syrupy on the palate, with oranges, sweet sherry, honey, and figs. Spicy oak, caramel, citrus fruits, and aniseed in the lengthy finish."
3899,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Sea Fog 7 year old, 45%<review>This doles out big pot still character from the start and feels like it’s taking a deep cut into the distillate, lending a bold and somewhat rustic note that suggests rhum agricole. The nose has smoky and vegetal notes that border on rubber tire, adding a fair amount of intrigue to the nutty malt lurking just below. Generous in body, with sweet vanilla and a fudge-like finish. (1,350 bottles)"
3900,"<price>102<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Islay Blended Malt #1 23 year old, 46.3%<review>This is a sophisticated and finessed take on Islay blended malt, which must be Kilchoman-free given the age statement. Driftwood, waxy lemons, soft buttery fudge, banana milkshake, dry grasses, and the gentlest puff of smoke promise calm seas ahead. A silken dram, anointing the palate with lemon meringue pie, honey, and caramel. This becomes creamier, with faint tendrils of smoke and dancing spices through to the finish. Utterly charming and tremendous value for the money. (419 bottles) £82"
3901,"<price>29<rating>82<whiskey>Coopers’ Craft Straight Bourbon, 41.1%<review>You can actually smell the cooper toasting oak here, so the name carries real meaning. Then cotton candy, fresh-baked rye, vanilla, apple, and caramel come to life. A slight hint of grain becomes more expressive on the tongue, offering bread-like flavors with hints of brown sugar and honey. Short finish with a hint of grain. If you like light-bodied bourbons, this is right up your alley."
3902,"<price>99<rating>95<whiskey>George T. Stagg Kentucky Straight (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2020), 65.2%<review>
Bakery notes, orange blossom, allspice, dark berries, raspberry preserves, butterscotch, chocolate, leather, and cedar chest integrate superbly on the nose. The show continues on a very full-bodied palate packed with dark fruit, orange slices, brown sugar, almond, cinnamon, and an overlay of allspice. A deliciously thick, viscous finish goes on and on, completing this tour de force with flavors of chocolate-covered marshmallows, cinnamon, more allspice, old leather, tobacco, and polished oak."
3903,"<price>92<rating>84<whiskey>Glenmorangie Dornoch Limited Edition, 43%<review>This bottling of Glenmorangie has been released to raise awareness of marine conservation. A proportion of the whisky has been finished in amontillado sherry butts. The nose offers honey, vanilla, peaches, toffee bonbons, wood lacquer, sherry, and a hint of peat. Soft and elegant on the palate, with fruity spice, nutty toffee, more sherry, and sweet smoke. Slightly smoky in the finish, with soft oak, citrus fruit, and aniseed. (Travel Retail only) £60"
3904,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Edradour 9 year old 2006 Barolo Cask Matured (Batch 5), 46%<review>This expression of Edradour was distilled in April 2006 and was the fifth batch to be matured in Barolo wine hogsheads. Fruity farmyard aromas, spice, then developing heather honey, soft oak, and caramel. Earthy fruit notes on the palate, with walnuts, malt, and pepper. Mildly mouth-drying in the medium-length finish, with aniseed and black pepper. (2,000 bottles) £50"
3905,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Yellow Spot, 46%<review>It works like this: triple distilled single pot still whiskey matured in bourbon, sherry, and Malaga casks, which produce a complex drink with aromas of red fruits, spice, nutmeg-dusted custard tarts, blossom honey, dried raspberry, clotted cream, cracked black pepper, and sweet flowering jasmine. The sweetness and nutmeg flavors are swallowed up by an overwhelming force of clove, with a finish of bitter nut oils and burnt toast."
3906,"<price>85<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Rollercoaster, 57.3%<review>Deep gold color. Very bold aroma of toffee, dark chocolate, diesel fuel-soaked soil, smoldering campfire, coal tar, clove, leather, fig, and dark berried fruit. More of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are. If you like your Islay whiskies young and brooding, this one’s for you."
3907,"<price>500<rating>91<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Sinatra Century, 50%<review>Rich and sweet on the nose: crème brûlée, unfinished oak furniture, circus peanuts, overripe warm melon. Corn puffs and sweet cornbread, vanilla cream, oak density, firm heat, and an affably full mouthfeel that doesn’t thin till the very end. Easily one of the best Jack Daniel’s whiskeys I’ve ever had, but the price is jaw-dropping even today (the package does include a previously-unreleased 1966 concert recording of Old Blue Eyes). Price is per 1 liter."
3908,"<price>115<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank 15 year old, 46%<review>Powerful, mature, and nicely rounded. Similar in some ways to the Springer 10 year old 46% reviewed below, with the addition of toasted coconut and caramel. It’s also more rounded and with greater depth."
3909,"<price>154<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Dimensions Range (distilled at Longmorn) 1996, 52.6%<review>Immediately identifiably Longmorn: that ridiculous, highly amenable mix of soft fruits, masses of sweet spice, candied peels, coconut, and sticky toffee pudding. In fact, it’s almost over the top in its lushness. Leans into the mouth with masses of mace, then soft fruits and marzipan develop. Unctuous, long, and ripe, the wood shows just a little, but the depth and richness holds it in check. Very good. £97"
3910,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marco De Bartoli Marsala Cask-Finished, 46%<review>Aromas of green apples, zested lime, and caramel entice the senses with hints of banana peel and nuts. Succulent green apple, honey, and vanilla, this has a thick, syrupy, mouth-drawing palate. Baked pear and peppery spices continue into the finish. This expression feels recognizably part of the Knappogue Castle family, yet offers a more sophisticated and progressive take on finishing. (1,020 bottles)"
3911,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Strathisla 16 year old, 55.3%<review>This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37"
3912,"<price>20<rating>89<whiskey>Spicebox, 40%<review>Tons of vanilla and sweet custard in the nose, enough to make the mouth water, and not fake-smelling at all. Once again, the 40% makes a difference: light and sweet in the mouth, like a glass of creme brulee eau de vie! I'd enjoyed the sweet vanilla-spice character so much that the whisky slipping in at the end was almost a shock, but it's there, and even adds a bit of mint and fire. Embarrassingly tasty. "
3913,"<price>179<rating>87<whiskey>Dublin Liberties Murder Lane 13 year old, 46%<review>Darryl McNally’s killer new whiskey was finished in Tokaj casks and launched to coincide with the opening of their new distillery. Inhaling the volatiles evokes scents of lime, sugar-sprinkled puff pastry, sweet and sour plum, toasted oak, and Chinese five spice. The waxy mouthfeel, with cooked fruit, sweet vanilla, marzipan, orange, and plum, is silenced when the trigger is pulled on the pepper, allspice, and clove ending. Well-executed. €160"
3914,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Signatory 16 year old 1988 vintage (Cask #42508, distilled at Bowmore), 46%<review>Medium-bodied and nicely textured. Good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated, too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain, cookie dough, caramel, and vanilla cream), young heathery peat, tar, fishnets, and brine that is complementary, but not aggressive, with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. Balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)"
3915,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Scott Selection (distilled at Bladnoch) vintage, 59%<review>Gold color. Citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout. This whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs., which should be no surprise for a Lowland whisky. The palate delivers what the aroma promises, with a touch of honey up front, citrus and vanilla in the middle, and a delicate dryness on the finish. I've always admired Bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion."
3916,"<price>95<rating>85<whiskey>Arran Malt Orkney Bere, 56.2%<review>Isle of Arran Distillers has introduced a second edition of its Orkney Bere expression, made with an ancient variety of barley still cultivated in the Orkney Islands and aged in bourbon barrels. It is a cask strength 10 year old variant, and 4,890 bottles are available. The nose is quite oily, with ripe peaches and pineapple cubes, plus developing floral notes. Viscous and sweet on the palate, with tangerines, caramel, and rich spices. The finish is lengthy, with coconut and milk chocolate-coated caramel."
3917,"<price>101<rating>88<whiskey>Hazelburn Rundlets & Kilderkins 10 year old 3rd release, 50.1%<review>This bottling of triple-distilled Hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. Malt, chocolate, and honey figure on the nose, along with a contrasting marine note in the background. Unctuous and rich on the palate, with soft fruit, almonds, brittle toffee, and lots of spice. The finish is lengthy and earthy, with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60"
3918,"<price>230<rating>88<whiskey>Scott's Selection 30 year old 1974 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 52.4%<review>Quite fresh and lively for its age and loaded with fruit. You’ll find bright fruit (tangerine, passion fruit, lemon) followed by subtle, sweeter fruit (coconut, honeydew melon, banana, and apple crumb pie). Resinous, minty oak notes and a hefty viscosity give the whisky some structure, while floral notes (lavender, rose petals) and gentle vanilla expose a softer side to the whisky. Dry, oak finish."
3919,"<price>120<rating>85<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Glencadam), 31 year old, 1974 vintage, 43%<review>Nice malty foundation and soothingly creamy, with sweet notes (sticky toffee pudding, vanilla cream, caramel custard) integrating well with dry oak spice and fruit (peaches, blueberry, and currants).l Very easy-going and friendly. A very nice Glencadam and reasonably priced for its age. 
"
3920,"<price>60<rating>71<whiskey>Distillery Select 'Craiglodge' (distilled at Loch Lomond), 8 year old, 1998 vintage, 45%<review>Aged in a sherry cask, which adds sweet notes of toffee, Caribbean rum, waxed fruit, red licorice, and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. A much sweeter, fruitier affair than the Croftengea also reviewed here, but behind all that sherry there’s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing. 
"
3921,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Unaged Rye, 40%<review>Clear as Cave Spring water, a mashbill of 70% rye, “mellowed” by charcoal, and ignorant of barrel-aging. It is white dog-brash: fresh wet grain, trampled grass, and a salty tinge. The spirit is pleasurably smooth and cool, sweet in body with a bitter film of rye spice. A gentlemanly clear spirit that’s itching to get into a cocktail; my only real complaint is the price. (This is “a taste of what’s to come,” so expect an aged rye to follow.)"
3922,"<price>128<rating>88<whiskey>The Singleton of Glen Ord 14 year old, 57.6%<review>This was aged in refill American oak barrels and bodega European oak butts followed by what Diageo describes as a “unique maturation and marrying process, involving five cask types.” The nose is soft and sweet, presenting malt, ginger, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Orchard fruits surface in time. Supple in the mouth, with toffee, ripe peaches, gingerbread, and old leather. Dark berries, char, and black pepper in the finish. £100"
3923,"<price>175<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box The Double Single 2017 Release, 46%<review>Not seen since 2010, this yields vanilla frosting, menthol, spearmint, cream, dry spices, cedarwood, chopped herbs, and a discernable whiff of old grain. Silky taste of butterscotch; it becomes more honeyed, with creamy vanilla, dried banana, malt, and a pinch of cinnamon, pepper, herbs, clove, and eucalyptus. The yin and yang of Glen Elgin and Girvan makes an admirable exercise in precision, minimalist blending. Mad as a box of frogs."
3924,"<price>63<rating>90<whiskey>GlenDronach Traditionally Peated, 48%<review>GlenDronach is known for its unpeated sherry-matured whiskies. This peated expression was matured in Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry casks, and some port pipes. Hand-rolled tobacco smoke, ginger, honey, malt, and barbecued bacon on the nose. New leather, smoky orange, treacle, and milk chocolate on the earthy palate. Light smoke, wood polish, mixed nuts, and licorice in the lengthy finish. Pleasing balance of sweet, savory, and smoky notes. (£51)"
3925,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Straight Malt Whiskey, 45.2%<review>This malt whiskey shows some maple syrup and honey sweetness, but its character comes from savory notes of earthiness and wet leaves. The easygoing palate offers some stone fruit and sweet overripe banana, like a banana cream pie with graham cracker crust. But the finish circles back to savory and herbal, suggesting youth. A creative, if peculiar choice for Woodford, crafted from 51% malted barley."
3926,"<price>14<rating>81<whiskey>Sir Edward’s Blended Whisky, 40%<review>From the perfumed nose to the sweet and short finish, this blend doesn’t really put a foot wrong, but it’s shy and unadventurous.
Clearly well made, well balanced, and quite acceptable, it has a perfumed black currant sherbet nose, some slight but enjoyable blueberry, grape, and prune notes and a soft sweet conclusion. On its own, all fine: but it gets lost when in company."
3927,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Glenlivet 18 year old, 43%<review>There’s no doubt that this is from Glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers, now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery, the fruits tinned pineapple, windfall apples. An added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. Liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. A sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. Recommended."
3928,"<price>119<rating>80<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1990, 51.9%<review>Vicks inhaler (menthol, camphor, and pine needle oil), freshly unwrapped sticks of spearmint gum, cilantro, and root ginger make for a stimulating, if not exactly charming olfactory experience. Mouth-filling and structured with good weight, this has sweet orange and a mild gingery glow. Although there are fleeting vegetal notes, it stays just sweet of the middle. Close heat on the finish, saturating the taste buds with spice and dark citrus. £83"
3929,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Slane Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>Brown-Forman deployed a triple-cask finishing process on mature sourced whiskeys, involving virgin oak, refill, and sherry casks. A lovely fruity complexity ensues, with blackberry, apple-toffee notes, malt, vanilla, and sherry influences. Butterscotch with nutty undertones, herbal notes verging toward spicy, and hints of dried apple, red berries, and a touch of leather roll into the finish. You want complexity, intrigue, and flavor for thirty bucks? Look no further."
3930,"<price>37<rating>83<whiskey>Grand Macnish Six Cask Edition, 40%<review>Playing on regional styles, this blends six single malts representative of the Speyside, Islay, Lowland, Campbeltown, Islands, and Highland whisky regions. Sun-dried peats greet the nose with aromas of stewed apples, flaky pastries, apricot conserve, vanilla, and cinnamon. Creamy vanilla and coconut flavors develop, with a slow-burn spiciness crackling in the center of the tongue. Seville orange and caramel cookie flavors escort a long finish of dry, tingling spices, though it could use a little more heft in the mouthfeel."
3931,"<price>34<rating>82<whiskey>Wigle Whim Mocha Porter, 46%<review>I reviewed a couple of these one-off Wigle Whims earlier. This one’s quite roasty indeed, almost coffee-like, made with roasted barley and wheat, and caramel and chocolate malts. It smells of burnt grain with sweet toffee underneath. Lots of chocolate and cocoa struggle with ash and burnt grain, leading to a hot finish where they end up, finally, in agreement, a smoky mocha mouthful, espresso whiskey. Invigorating. Price is per 375 ml."
3932,"<price>240<rating>93<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Strathisla), 35 year old, Cask #7009, 45.1%<review>Aromatically fruity and quite full, with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. The fruit (golden raisins, apricot, red licorice, papaya) is balanced by restrained honey, vanilla, and fennel. The whisky is always dry but never excessively so. A delicious, ultra-mature whisky. 
"
3933,"<price>95<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Brandy Casket (distilled at Glen Garioch) 1989, 46%<review>Wemyss Malts has bottled this 23 year old hogshead-matured example of Glen Garioch from the Aberdeenshire village of Oldmeldrum. Just 322 bottles were yielded by the cask. Cigarette tobacco, brittle toffee, and a hint of aniseed on the nose. Vanilla develops, along with strawberries, apples, and pears. Rich malt, walnuts, cooked apple, and cinnamon on the palate. The spicy finish features old leather and pepper. £105 "
3934,"<price>27620<rating>90<whiskey>The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1968 46 year old (Cask# 7293), 45.9%<review>The oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. The dried blossoms of youth are there, still with a little color to them, while a curl of smoke also comes through. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden eruption of tropical fruits, a flaring in the dying light. There’s no oakiness, just a distillery, framed, gently receding. A remarkable dram. It’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19,000"
3935,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Auchentoshan Valinch, 57.5%<review>Auchentoshan Valinch is essentially a cask strength version of the popular Classic expression. It is named after the metal tube used to extract samples of spirit from the cask. A nose of tinned peaches in syrup, Madeira, cinnamon, newly-planed wood, coconut, and vanilla notes. Sweet and spicy on the creamy palate, with vanilla, honey, and praline. Oak and spice in the peach liqueur-like finish."
3936,"<price>60<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich 12 year old (2nd Edition), 46%<review>A replacement to the original 10 year old, which is now off the market. A clean, straightforward dram with a lightness and freshness which is very inviting. Notes of vanilla cream, light caramel, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), clementine, pear, and a hint of currant. Appetizing, subtly briny finish."
3937,"<price>107<rating>92<whiskey>The Temple Bar 12 year old, 40%<review>Matured in American oak in the private cellar of this Dublin bar, this flaunts zested lemons, a fine layer of honey, orange segments, and sanded oak. It’s splendidly floral, but reassuringly not perfumed. Sweet, smooth caramels, oranges, spicy pepper, and gingerbread, though the spices never overstep the mark. Develops with concentrated citrus, vanilla fudge, and chocolate orange and slips down effortlessly. Soothing, relaxing, and perfectly matured."
3938,"<price>69<rating>82<whiskey>Two James Grass Widow, 45.5%<review>MGP-sourced bourbon is finished in Madeira barriques, and shows a nicely reddish color. Nose is corn and wine gums; not hot, not sweet. Flash-hot in the mouth, light body and some candy and minerality with the corn; a prickly heat and acidity at the end, but overall, more pleasant than that sounds."
3939,"<price>47<rating>81<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Rye 90, 45%<review>Light in body, with soft fruit, graham cracker, and delicate honey. Oak tannin, leather, and prickly spice kick in mid-palate, but there’s not enough body and sweet notes to balance it.  Warm, spicy finish. Price is per 375 ml."
3940,"<price>123<rating>84<whiskey>Glenfiddich Age of Discovery 19 year old, 40%<review>Named in honor of the early Portuguese explorers, this newest Glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in Madeira drums. This has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date, fig, and black grape. The palate is sweet and smooth with a pickup of gingery spices toward the finish. Well balanced and quite a departure. (Travel Retail exclusive, not available in the U.S.) £75"
3941,"<price>127<rating>87<whiskey>Sovereign (distilled at Cameronbridge) 23 year old 1990, 59.2%<review>Appearances can be deceptive, as this pallid specimen proves. Overripe honeydew melons, lemon cheesecake sprinkled with zest, vanilla pear muffins, cooked apple, spring blossoms, and icing sugar. The sweet, sugary opener is burnt out enjoyably by blistering burnt orange, butterscotch, and lemon bonbons. While the flavor intensity builds commendably, it doesn’t escape without a touch of astringency. Water makes this sing ‘Oranges and Lemons,’ but go easy with it. The finish is like a greedy mouthful of tarte au citron. £80"
3942,"<price>61<rating>81<whiskey>Singleton of Glen Ord 12 year old, 40%<review>Launched in southeast Asia in 2006, 12 year old Glen Ord boasts a nose that is sweet and gingery, with toffee, a hint of tangerine, along with vanilla, sherry, and oriental spices. The palate mirrors the nose with more spice, then chocolate, and milky coffee. Finally, quite drying. RM247"
3943,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>Wyoming Outryder American Whiskey, 50%<review>A blend of two whiskeys: a high-rye bourbon and a whiskey made with 48% rye, 40% corn, and 12% malted barley. Dill, tarragon, spearmint, iced tea, cured tobacco leaf, roasted nuts, red apple, black cherry, and lemonade on the nose. A balanced and textured palate, with iced tea, dark fruit, roasted pecans, mild spice, and rich chocolate flavors. More richness on the finish, which is lengthy and lush, with dark chocolate, pecans, and iced tea. This is well-proofed, but a little water makes it sing. (3,462 bottles)"
3944,"<price>1279<rating>86<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1984 (Cask #6032), 47%<review>Delicate, with some jasmine, lily of the valley, and even, with time, the rich aldehydes of Chanel No.5. This heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added, alongside apple. The palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water, becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. One for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760"
3945,"<price>47<rating>71<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection 'Double Barreled,' 1993 Vintage, 45%<review>A big bourbon in many respects, but this is one whiskey where I would have happily settled for a “Single Barreled.” I tasted this whiskey straight from the barrel right before it was bottled and it was more aggressive; I think the lower strength and chill-filtering has helped to tame this beast. To be honest, there are some good qualities to this whiskey. The nose is wonderful! Even the palate starts out fine, with chewy toffee, molasses, dark fruit, raisins, and dates. But it is quickly consumed by intensely dry oak spice, gripping resin, and leather, which clings to my tongue and won’t let go. In this instance, last impressions are lasting impressions. Price is per 375 ml.
"
3946,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Kilchoman Sauternes Cask Finish 2018, 50%<review>Having previously released bottlings that were fully matured in sauternes casks, Kilchoman has now launched one where initial maturation took place in bourbon barrels, followed by 5 months of finishing in sauternes hogsheads. Unpeeled Jaffa oranges on the initial nose, floral, with a whiff of iodine and earthy peat. Tangerines, milk chocolate, lively spices, and bitumen combine on the palate. The finish is long, smoky, and perpetually spicy."
3947,"<price>89<rating>90<whiskey>Kaiyo Mizunara Oak The Peated (2nd Edition), 46%<review>This is utterly unique; made from imported Scottish peated malt, it spends 2 years in madeira casks, then 6 years in mizunara casks. Light, clean, fruity refreshment: apple, white grape, lingering cigar smoke, coconut macaroons, and ample Japanese oak influence. Apple and watermelon flavors, developing a more sugary fruitiness of Life Savers hard candy, all brushed with gentle spice and a swish of smoke."
3948,"<price>90<rating>88<whiskey>Mackmyra Special No. 10, 46.1%<review>It’s well possible that this will be the last of the Special range, and if so, then it is both a bit of a whisper of an ending, and a highly pleasant one. This is as easygoing and gentle as Mackmyra ever gets. Very much a sweet and savory delight, this is a soft dessert whisky with banana and cream in evidence. That’s before someone pours the salt pot over it. Even then the caramel and fruit battle back. Highly enjoyable."
3949,"<price>87<rating>94<whiskey>High Coast Quercus IV Mongolica, 50.8%<review>The final installment in this impressive series gets to the heart of Quercus mongolica, using slow-grown Asian oak sourced from northeastern China, which is much less porous than Japanese mizunara. Aromas of Cox’s orange pippin, rhubarb, caramel, malt, pecan pie, peppercorn, clove, and appealing sandalwood notes. Deliciously malty with sweet sponge cake, citrus oils, dried apple, soft caramel, nuts, and clove, with a mouth-coating finish of vanilla caramel. Totally moreish. (6,228 bottles) (€80)"
3950,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Baker’s Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (No. 000185706), 53.5%<review>The nose is a bit tight, reluctantly giving up brown sugar on warm cereal, dried banana chips, honey peanuts, and figgy dried fruits. The palate comes across really dense and chewy with dark berries and sweet prune notes, laced with licorice and cinnamon spice. The dark fruit flavors feel lush and decadent, while drying oak lends lovely maturity and polish. As Baker’s is now a single-barrel product, your experience may vary with each bottle, although the proof will remain the same."
3951,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 67.7%<review>Distilled in 2003. Weller is the only wheated bourbon in the Collection, with wheat replacing the rye found in most other bourbons. It’s a very impressive representation, too. Notes of nutty toffee, black raspberry, blueberry, green tea, cinnamon, and vanilla. Soft, lingering oak on the finish. Like last year’s release, this is a soothing whiskey with a gentle demeanor. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016. Editor's Choice."
3952,"<price>125<rating>90<whiskey>Teerenpeli Kaski, 43%<review>The nose is lavish, with dried orange peel, raisins, plum, gingersnaps, aniseed, and menthol. It’s a thick, malty, statement whisky, rich with raisin, prune juice, heather honey, fig, and walnut, and laced with aniseed and clove. Pleasantly reminiscent of childhood cough medicine, there are long, sweet, syrupy prune notes at the end. It feels like it must be doing you some good. (3,000 bottles)"
3953,"<price>119<rating>88<whiskey>Ardbeg Kelpie, 46%<review>A proportion of the component whiskies has been matured in virgin Black Sea oak casks, while the rest has been aged in bourbon barrels. The nose is sweet, with warm cloves and soft peat; a hint of brine. When it comes to the palate—curious! Menthol and herbal notes, toasted oak, plain chocolate, sweet antiseptic. Mildly tannic in the finish, with subtle peaty spiciness. An herbal peat note lingers long."
3954,"<price>78<rating>87<whiskey>Signatory Vintage 10 year old (distilled at Edradour, Cask 41), 46%<review>Part of Signatory’s Un-Chillfiltered Collection, this was distilled on February 25, 2005 and bottled on November 25, 2015. Initially a little earthy on the nose, then more fragrant, with orange blossom, nutmeg, and a hint of polished oak. Oily and rounded on the palate, with supple sherry influences: prunes, dates, more orange, and tingling spices, plus toffee. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of smoke and lingering spicy Jaffa orange notes."
3955,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>Knob Creek 15 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>One sniff is like opening a box of chocolates—plenty of different aromas, from raspberry filling to pecans to spice, but all suffused with cacao, an impression borne out by the rich, full palate. Think dark chocolate torte, cocoa-dusted truffles, bits of semi-sweet baker’s chocolate broken off the bar and snuck into the mouth. More cocoa powder, toasted nuts, and polished oak on the finish, which is shot through with cinnamon and pepper."
3956,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey> Port Charlotte 10 year old, 50%<review>Distilled from Scottish barley, this is the first permanent age-statement Port Charlotte bottling. First and second-fill American oak and French wine casks were used for aging. Rock pools, lemon juice, caramel, but little overt peat on the nose. The palate boasts big orchard fruit notes, smoky coconut, and brine. Again, the peat is quite muted. Long and spicy in the drying, peaty finish."
3957,"<price>149<rating>93<whiskey>Glenlivet Enigma, 60.6%<review>A riddle inside a bottle, this release follows Glenlivet’s previous mystery series bottlings Alpha, Cipher, and Code. Packaged in a jet-black bottle and box that look part Arthur C. Clarke monolith and part 3-D cryptic crossword puzzle, it’s devoid of cask information or tasting notes by design. The best solution is to open it and unlock the whisky’s secrets. Classic Glenlivet notes of lemon curd, melon, fresh peaches, bitter orange, and baked apples on the nose, followed by a smooth, creamy palate of marshmallow, toasted almond, marzipan, and lemon iced tea. The long, vibrant finish is replete with crème brûlée, sultana, cinnamon, and tropical fruit. Number 8 in the 2019 Top 20 "
3958,"<price>40<rating>95<whiskey>Crown Royal Special Reserve, 40%<review>Creamy, silky texture on the palate. Richer than the flagship Crown Royal, but still quite clean on the palate. Along with creamy vanilla, delicate fruit and floral notes, you’ll also find caramel and butterscotch, a peppering of spice (particularly cinnamon), and light nougat. Silky smooth finish. A benchmark whisky in the traditional Canadian style."
3959,"<price>305<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet), cask #2831, 39 year old, 44.7%<review>This whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured Glenlivet whiskies I’ve tasted. Notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit, old rum, caramel custard, shortbread cookies, vanilla malt, and a hint of cotton candy. This is all balanced by polished oak. A soothing, rather sweet whisky (which is quite surprising for its age)."
3960,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>William Grant Rare Cask Reserves Ghosted Reserve 21 year old, 42.8%<review>A purity and fragility rarely encountered, with aromas as fleeting as footprints on wet sand: marshmallow, meringue, honey, and rose petals. A delicacy to the structure brings banana, caramel, spun sugar, and orange peel. The oak spices build slowly, making the lips throb from the inside. It’s an elaborate maze of ethereal suggestion and an apparition of calm beauty. It atrophies reluctantly, leaving tangy peels and lengthy sweetness anchored by spicy base notes. (12,000 bottles)"
3961,"<price>158<rating>87<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Glen Moray) 27 year old, 56.8%<review>Each independent bottler has its own signature style. Adelphi’s is about relaxed, contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. Here you see this, plus crème brûlée, sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. The opening is slow, and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there, hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. A luscious dram. £99"
3962,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Naked Grouse, 43%<review>Finishing these malts in first-fill oloroso casks helps produce a tempting nose of tangy marmalade, cherry, chocolate sponge, malt, and apple tart, with a rub of spice. Chocolate, spiced orange, pepper, and ginger notes before sweet toffee breaks through, allowing the orange peel-rich marmalade to mingle with the malt. It’s a big mouthful and definitely one to try."
3963,"<price>60<rating>82<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Caol Ila), 12 year old, 1991 Vintage, 40%<review>Notes of smoked olives and an earthy peatiness wrapped inside layers of sweetness (honey, caramel and light toffee). The whisky is laced with seaweed and pepper for added zest, with a long smoky and peppery finish. It shows enough maturity, yet it is young enough to let the true Caol Ila character shine through. I would like to have seen this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. 
"
3964,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Eifel Single Malt, 46%<review>A decade ago, Eifel began to distill in the German grain-distilling tradition using a column still with a second pot still distillation. Named after a low mountain range in western Germany, this has a punchy nose of stewed apple and rhubarb, pepper, clove, ground ginger, and dried citrus peel, with hints of chocolate. Quite distinctive: stewed fruit, plum, peppermint, candied orange, and a finish of chocolate-covered mint candy. (3,000 bottles)"
3965,"<price>115<rating>86<whiskey>The Cooper’s Choice (distilled at Ben Nevis) 18 year old, 46%<review>Distilled in 1996 and bottled in June 2015 after maturing in sherry casks, this Cooper’s Choice expression of Ben Nevis yields an initially savory character, with ripe figs, treacle, and a hint of tar. Quite chewy in the mouth, with spicy toffee and cherries, which develop into more citric fruit over time. The finish is lengthy and warming, with a hint of oak and black coffee."
3966,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Maker’s Mark Cask Strength, 56.6%<review>This is what I wish the standard Maker’s Mark would be: more mature, spicier, more complex, and with a richer finish. Caramel kissed with honey provides a base for marzipan, cotton candy, cinnamon, clove, and a balancing leather dryness on the finish."
3967,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Bone Snapper X-Ray 4 year old Reserve Straight Rye (Batch 2), 55%<review>This pours punchy, vivid, and somewhat youthful with sparks of white pepper, cereal grain aromas, and an impression of menthol and alpine herbs. At full proof, it opens with a fiery flurry of sizzling spices, as cinnamon hearts candies meet sweet candied apple and dense fruitiness—raisin and fig—that evolve to grilled pineapple and melon. (914 bottles)"
3968,"<price>120<rating>87<whiskey>Exclusive Malts North Highland 17 year old 1996 Cask # 7025, 56.1%<review>From an undisclosed North Highland distillery, aged in a refill sherry hogshead. The impact of the sherry is clear, with ripe blackberry and peach. A floral, sweet, clover honey note rounds out a deliciously lush mouthfeel. This lushness is well balanced by a spicy mid-palate that features black pepper, ginger, and strong salinity that help provide some real depth. A long and slightly dry finish wraps up a solid whisky. (U.S. only)"
3969,"<price>45<rating>86<whiskey>George Remus Straight Bourbon, 47%<review>Cotton candy, caramel, baked apples, roasted pecans, freshly baked rye rolls, and herbs start a truly approachable pour. Its story opens in a spice race: cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and smoked paprika and a slight hint of coffee. A burst of dill hits, just before vanilla walks it home to a lovely, medium finish. An interesting sipper, but remarkable in cocktails."
3970,"<price>119<rating>84<whiskey>Nant Bourbon Cask, 43%<review>The Nant estate is self-sufficient for about a third of the barley it needs to make its Tasmanian Highland malt whisky. Nosing reveals a lemon tree, light summer fruits of melon, lychee, and grape, floral honey, barley, sliced almond, fragrant vanilla, and a powdering of spices. Well-structured and full bodied, there is blossom honey, baked lemon, Murray mints, fresh water mint, green fruits, and sweet vanilla. It slips down beautifully, coating the mouth, leaving light spice and dark sugar. A$165"
3971,"<price>39<rating>90<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania Rye, 45%<review>Dad’s Hat rye has evolved, like many craft whiskeys, but they’re still bottling at 6 to 9 months (another label is planned for a straight version). That’s working well. The nose is rip-roaring rye: crushed grain, grass, sweet spice, bitter herbal notes, with all the complexity of the grain. Delivers honestly on the tongue, too, plus a light barrel character, proceeding to an integrated finish. Excellent young rye, there’s no mistaking the mother grain."
3972,"<price>280<rating>91<whiskey>Douglas Laing Extra Old Particular (distilled at Mortlach) 22 year old, 57.1%<review>Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. Excellent. £191"
3973,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Connemara 12 year old, 40%<review>Connemara’s wild west coast landscape is a world away from this peated whiskey’s production at Cooley Distillery on Ireland’s east coast. Greater smoke than Original; lemon and fresh cream translate into lemon lozenges and sherbet, with tangy tropical fruits and well-balanced smoke lasting throughout the finish."
3974,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Garrison Brothers Texas Bourbon Fall 2012 Release, 47%<review>A 2 year old bourbon made from Texas-grown white corn. It sports a dusty nose full of dry corn and oaky spice. The whiskey is big-boned, juicy and sweet, but with a bitter streak of wood running through it. The finish confirms the youth of the whiskey as it flames in a long, hot wind-up. Some very interesting components here, waiting for better integration. "
3975,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Elijah Craig Toasted Barrel Kentucky Straight, 47%<review>
Initially reticent on the nose, with time this reveals gooey caramel, pralines, Hershey’s milk chocolate, and a touch of charred mint leaves. It’s chewy and occasionally sharp on the palate, with oodles of roasted nuts, polished oak, mint, peppery spice, dark chocolate, licorice, tobacco ash, and char. The medium-length finish holds tingling white pepper, unsweetened chocolate, and more polished oak."
3976,"<price>37<rating>88<whiskey>Russell’s Reserve 10 year old, 45%<review>The nose tickles with caramel, spice, vanilla, and earthiness, with just a hint of balsamic vinegar.  Warming. Coated with spices, ranging from cinnamon to allspice and from coffee to nutmeg. Eventually, patented caramel and vanilla, with a fun hint of cardamom. The long, enjoyable finish is earthy, but there’s an unwanted bitterness at the end that cannot be denied. If not for the bitter end, this would rate much higher."
3977,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Virginia Distillery Company Brewers Batch (Batch #001), 46%<review>Delicate, floral, sweet, and reminiscent of a Lowland malt with its Creamsicle nose. Flavors of papaya, bright citrus, and green tea are nicely balanced with the perfect touch of smoke on the pleasingly oily palate, while the long finish smacks of baked apples, cocoa, and minerality. Wonderfully balanced and moreish, this is a happy marriage of Scotch whisky and Virginia single malt whiskey finished in a cask that previously held Wee Heavy style beer. (1,500 bottles)
"
3978,"<price>108<rating>88<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 43 year old, 47.7%<review>Like a throwback to childhood: fruity lollipops, Love Hearts, and gobstoppers. Stewed apple, crusty bread, and dry roasted coriander seeds add more dimension to the nose. The palate has toffee, orange peel, dates, and briefly flirts with chocolate and coffee, though this grain has mouth-drawing astringency and savory spices to balance the sweetness. Long finish of aniseed, spiced dark toffee, and charred oak."
3979,"<price>2000<rating>93<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1964 vintage, 44.7%<review>The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection whiskies. This is a very complex whisky, with exotic notes of oak, sultana, vanilla cream, almonds, and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced, with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished, deep, and continuously evolving, with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it, but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You’ll need deep pockets, though."
3980,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Rabbit Hole Rye, 47.5%<review>At 95% rye and 5% malted barley, it’s initially an herbal and floral bomb, with slight hints of earth and rising bread dough. Then cinnamon, and lots of it, over nutmeg, baked apples, clove, ginger, and molasses. An explosion of cracked black pepper dominates toward the medium finish with a slight hint of baked pear. Tasty as a summer sipper or cocktail base."
3981,"<price>95<rating>89<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 2008 Mòine Bordeaux Red Wine Cask Matured, 58.1%<review>Bunnahabhain has been marketing batches of peated spirit under the Mòine banner since 2004, and this example is the first to have been fully matured in Bordeaux red wine casks. Damp peat, sweet antiseptic, and subtle raspberry aromas. Lots of red berry notes on the palate, backed by milky coffee, peat, and vanilla. Black pepper and berry fruits in the smoky finish."
3982,"<price>49<rating>89<whiskey>Kaiyo Mizunara Oak The Single 7 year old, 48%<review>This whisky spends 7 years in bourbon barrels with a 6-month finish in mizunara. Sandalwood, incense, long pepper, grapefruit, cilantro leaf, pencil shavings, and red pepper rice cracker give this a dry, fragrant air. It’s silky with light honey, vanilla, fudge, and peaks with pepper, coconut, then green apple, before a finish of aromatic spices and tangy orange."
3983,"<price>64<rating>83<whiskey>Mackmyra Svensk Ek, 46.1%<review>Named after the 10% of the recipe that benefits from Swedish oak maturation, this light-colored dram has honey-drenched crumpets, creamed butter, green tea taken in lemon groves, and hints of peppermint. Shredded lemon and lime peels are joined by a precise, concentrated wood spice note with ground ginger and black pepper. Dilution fattens the mouthfeel but flattens the citrus peel, leaving a smudge of light toffee and malt. Pleasant sipping for those long, Swedish summer days. €59"
3984,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>The Irishman Vintage Cask (2019 Release), 54%<review>A dark, brooding whiskey with a nose of cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, clove, dark chocolate, baked apricots, and orange peel. The palate has dark toffee, peppermint, raisin, and pronounced clove elements before a second wave of dark chocolate, warm malted milk, cocoa, black pepper, praline, plum skins, and licorice. No burn on the finish, even at cask strength, just some delicious chocolate and malty notes with a blast of spice for good measure. (2,346 bottles; 186 for the U.S.)"
3985,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Vintage Bourbon, 17 year old, 47%<review>Notes of ""rummy"" molasses, Sugar Daddies, red currant, citrus peel, sandalwood, polished leather, and vanilla cream. Subtle, teasing black licorice and brittle mint emerge from time to time. Well-balanced, with all the flavors sharing the limelight. A beautiful example of mature bourbon. 
"
3986,"<price>53<rating>73<whiskey>Arizona Distilling Copper City Bourbon, 45%<review>The nose on this whiskey is like smelling a wet empty barrel; it's all oak, char, and cinnamon spice. The entry is thin, watery, and understated with light caramel and cinnamon. In the mid-palate, the oak tannins completely take over. It's not just oak spice, but the puckeringly dry, sour, and bitter tannins. This all leads to a bitter, bone dry finish. Good whiskey is a conversation between spirit and wood, but here the wood is doing all the talking."
3987,"<price>111<rating>91<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Bruichladdich) 23 year old, 47.4%<review>There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish."
3988,"<price>29<rating>87<whiskey>Redemption, 42%<review>Initially, floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices. Then it’s a plethora of vanilla in several forms, from icing to pudding, followed by notes of butterscotch, fudge, Oreo cookies, and pecan shell. Sweet cigar tobacco and honey follow this home to a short to medium finish with a hint of peach cobbler. Ideal for cocktails."
3989,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Bourbon (Batch 015), 53.8%<review>It opens with a crust of salt and Flintstones vitamins in honey, almond paste, and caramel. Then pumice, pear, canned peaches, and baked apples jump into the mix, followed by Nutella, Cheerios, candied pecans, and chocolate. As the medium to long finish sets in, slight hints of smoke appear and suggest it would pair great with a bold cigar. A drop of water only makes it better."
3990,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>M&H Classic, 46%<review>

Tomer Goren, head distiller at Milk & Honey Distillery in Tel Aviv, excels at warm climate single malt production under the intensity of the Mediterranean sun. His ethos is beautifully captured within this kosher-certified flagship bottling, matured in bourbon and shaved, toasted, and re-charred casks. It exudes a nose of golden syrup, vanilla, marshmallow, jasmine, dried apple, nutmeg, cinnamon, and pepper. Flavorful and juicy, the palate has satisfying depth, with caramel, vanilla, shortbread, honey, and orange, daubed with vivaciously spicy black pepper. Number 20 in the 2020 Top 20"
3991,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 12 year old, 46.3%<review>The nose is fresh, with sea salt, tangerines, and light smokiness. Vanilla, sultanas, malt, a hint of sherry, hazelnuts, and woodsmoke are present on the oily palate. Lingering in the finish, with salt and drying smoke."
3992,"<price>25899<rating>90<whiskey>Caol Ila Prima & Ultima 35 year old 1984 (Cask No. 5773), 50.8%<review>Sweet antiseptic, brine, new leather, and spice on the nose. The palate is lightly oily,
with lemon juice, grapefruit, salt water, soft peat, and fish smoked on a beach
barbecue. Smoky citrus fruits in the lengthy, gingery finish. Price is for entire Prima
& Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (499 bottles) £20,000"
3993,"<price>175<rating>95<whiskey>Willett Family Reserve, Barrel #81L31, 25 year old, 45.1%<review>Very mellow, silky in texture, and on the sweet side for mature bourbon. It’s not bold like Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old, which has much more oak spice and resin. Willett’s foundation of molasses and toffee is accentuated by candied fruit, fig, dusty corn, and tobacco, with mint tea, cinnamon, and vanilla peppered throughout. It’s perilously drinkable. I am impressed how these 20-plus year old Willett rye and bourbon whiskeys maintain their balance and keep the oak in check. Splendid ultra-mature bourbon. (Less than 100 bottles of this were sent to California, and not all the same barrel. Happy hunting.) 
"
3994,"<price>80<rating>81<whiskey>Inchmurrin Madeira Finish, 46%<review>A soft, perfumed nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, and a lightly spiced background. Voluptuous and initially very sweet on the palate, with malt and almonds, then ginger and chili kick in. Lively spices and fruit-and-nut chocolate continue through the lengthy and ultimately dry finish. £55"
3995,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Royal Lochnagar) 23 year old 1986, 46.3%<review>Soft, soothing, and gentle. Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish, too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
3996,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof High Rye 9 year old, 54.6%<review>First impression: spice and herbs completely own the moment. Then caramel, vanilla, and the cadre of baking spices develops into identifiable clove, cardamom, ginger, crushed poppy seeds, and cinnamon. Then the spice turns to another style: pepper, with hints of earthy black pepper and habañero jelly. Slight hints of vanilla, powdered sugar, and marshmallow appear just before a medium-to-long finish with a spicy caramel chew."
3997,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Abraham Bowman Double Barrel Bourbon, 50%<review>Hot wet oak, berries, Red Hots, and wet cornmeal. Closer to the nose, it’s sharper and woodier. Lots of wood on the entry, but sweet corn and cloved hard candy, too, with heat from the 100 proof that lingers through the oaky finish. At 7 years, this is extra-spicy, and a touch of water tames the heat and the oak. Bowman’s still finding its way, but the path seems right."
3998,"<price>119<rating>83<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Dalmore) 1997, 55.5%<review>This 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of Dalmore was distilled in May 1997, and 237 bottles have been released. It is an interesting example of Dalmore uncut, without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. The nose is sweet, with caramel, tinned peaches and pineapple, and a smearing of honey. Zesty spices open the palate, which becomes nutty, with Jaffa oranges, gingery oak, and dark chocolate. Long and warming in the finish, with more oak and plain chocolate. £78"
3999,"<price>2000<rating>87<whiskey>Port Ellen 34 year old, 55%<review>Here’s a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles)."
4000,"<price>43<rating>81<whiskey>Wyoming Small Batch Bourbon, 44%<review>Nose is a bit perfumed, like doilies at grandma's house, with grain, grass, and meadow notes. Flavor is minty, rye-bitter, and penetrating; finish is sweet and hot, with more grassiness. Powerful rye influence; not much corn, and that perfume note is odd, but the rye is gripping."
4001,"<price>350<rating>91<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 30 year old Imperial 1989 Single Cask (Cask No. 362), 43.3%<review>Perfumy in both aroma and flavor: rose potpourri, peach blossom, lemon drops, strawberry shortcake, talcum powder, and clean cereal notes on the nose. Candied rose petal on the palate, as well as dried fruit (especially with water), rich and well-integrated spice, cacao nibs, and dry oak. It’s distinctive and well-balanced, even when the oak seems a touch bitter. The finish is dry and leathery, with pipe tobacco, cinnamon, and, still, that rose note. (172 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4002,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Writers Tears Copper Pot, 40%<review>Blends of single pot still and single malt Irish whiskey without grain deserve their own category, but there’s no use crying about it. Roasted spices, Quaker Oats, light honey, and fresh apricot; a little reserved and demure. Golden honey sweetness, light citrus, green apple, peach pit, dried apricot, cereal notes, creamy vanilla, and a firm strand of pot still spiciness. Dry spice heat, citrus peel, and a dark vanilla aftertaste."
4003,"<price>592<rating>83<whiskey>GlenDronach 1971 vintage, 39 year old, oloroso (cask 489), 48.8%<review>This whisky is doddery and on the edge, bordering on feeble. You have to look hard to find its spark and fire, but if you search for it, it is there. The nose is light and savory, with crushed fall leaves and chestnut on the nose. On the palate, there are traces of licorice stick, a touch of cumin, anise, and a creamier, less bitter chocolate note than some other samples. It finishes with traces of mandarin, but overall the sun is setting and the spirited and energetic man of old seems to be getting bitter. Overall, though, still pretty impressive for its age. £380 "
4004,"<price>40<rating>92<whiskey>Rowan's Creek, Batch 03-59, 12 year old, 50.05%<review>Beautifully balanced, like Kentucky Vintage, but more complex and with greater depth. It’s also not as boldly dry as Pure Kentucky XO. Rather, it is softer and more seductive. This is splendid bourbon! It would be a shame to adulterate this bourbon in any way-don’t even think of mixing it. Find yourself a quiet moment, pour yourself a measure, and savor. 
"
4005,"<price>700<rating>90<whiskey>Caol Ila 30 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 55.1%<review>More smoke than is common from this distillery and age. The aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars, then a clambake, then oven-roasted lobster. With water, a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice, by the way). The palate is refined and mature, but with fresh fruits retained, with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. A mature Caol Ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7,638 bottles)"
4006,"<price>120<rating>87<whiskey>Caol Ila Unpeated 15 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 60.39%<review>The now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose, but under the burn is a clean, mineral, and slightly lean Caol Ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. A mix of grassiness/herbal notes, with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad, gooseberry, and fresh pineapple. The palate is sweet and cake-like, while the heat enhances its salty tang. Delightful, sweet, and long. (10,668 bottles)"
4007,"<price>175<rating>86<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Port Dundas) 25 year old 1991, 53.6%<review>Vanilla ice cream drizzled in caramel and speared with a couple of wafers. Ground hazelnut, faint dashes of cinnamon, and garam masala complete the nose. A brief opener of rich toffee and tangy citrus is overrun with a piquant, acidic rush and nippy alcohol flare. It’s actually light in texture, and a largely absorbing experience, ending on some dusty marshmallow notes, though never losing the tanginess. Water accentuates the tangerine and mandarin but negates the mallow candy flavors. (264 bottles)"
4008,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Redemption Barrel Proof 9 year old, 55.3%<review>Warmth. Bakery flavors set in right away, illustrating both sweet and spice: cinnamon bread, vanilla, yellow cake batter, gingersnaps, no-bake oatmeal cookies. Then, hints of smoke, dark cherries, chipotle pepper, and a slight hint of butterscotch. As is, it disappointingly finishes short, with a hint of cardamom. Water adds caramel complexity to the previously short finish."
4009,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>The Whistler Double Oaked Blended Irish Whiskey, 40%<review>Sweetness and richness were my first impressions of this sourced whiskey blended at Boann Distillery, and it’s the oloroso sherry finish that’s made all the difference. Apple, barley sugar, aromatic spices, baked citrus, cherry, and dried apricot against a backbone of grain. Vanilla fudge, baked fruit desserts, and apple, it’s rich, smooth, and creamy with swirling spices before returning to a finish of vanilla, spice, and dried apple."
4010,"<price>500<rating>84<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2003), 57.8%<review>Style: Islay single malt scotch Color: Pale straw Aroma: Peat smoke-lots of it. Damp earth. Hint of olives and seaweed. Palate: Surprisingly gentle in texture and on the light side of medium in body. A malty sweetness balances the dry-ish peat smoke. Again the damp earth mid palate. An appetizing saltiness emerges towards the finish, but is fleeting. Smoky finish."
4011,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Blackadder 22 year old Raw Cask Westport Single Cask (No. 3293), 53.2%<review>The nose is thick with bakeshop aromas: sponge cake filled with marzipan and thickly frosted with buttercream; butter pecan ice cream; and vanilla bean. It’s consistent on the palate, but more complex, with roasted lemons, vanilla malt powder, milk chocolate, cinnamon candy, pie crust, and buttercream frosting. No deviation on the finish, which is pastry-rich and dessert-like, veering toward flan. Westport is a “teaspooned” malt comprising mainly Glenmorangie with a bit of Glen Moray. (170 bottles; 90 for U.S.)"
4012,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box No Name (No. 2), 48.9%<review>So good, they didn’t name it twice. More brooding than the first iteration, with a heavy curtain of ashy sooty smoke, fresh herbal tones, lemon, and dried fruity sweetness. The palate is led by red cherry, plum, cranberry, and tangy orange peel, then hot smoke sets off a peppery firecracker. The structure is deceptively light, developing more grip as the lemon sherbet sweetness heralds the lengthy finish of beach bonfire smoke. (8,436 bottles)"
4013,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Eades “Double Malt” Islay (Second Edition), 46%<review>A marriage of two whiskies: 30% 18 year old Caol Ila finished in Chateau d’Yquem Sauternes casks and 70% 10 year old Bowmore finished in Grenache wine casks. A honeyed, sultana sweetness (from the d’Yquem?) nicely tames the rooty smoke, iodine, seaweed, brine, pepper, and subtle Spanish olive. Bramble and berried fruit (from the Grenache?) add another layer and dimension. A very dynamic whisky, worthy of exploring and debating how well all these flavors integrate with each other."
4014,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Glengoyne 17 year old, 43%<review>Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers, “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. Lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice."
4015,"<price>60<rating>78<whiskey>DYC 10th Anniversary single malt, 40%<review>Made entirely with Spanish barley and showing healthy progress, this 10 year old single malt is further proof that owner Beam Global is committed to producing quality Spanish single malt. But it has some way to go. This is a señorita, not a matador, and is far too polite — more like a blend than a single malt. Orange jelly, marzipan, and apple pip all make an appearance, but it’s all too safe. "
4016,"<price>450<rating>90<whiskey>Ardmore 30 year old, 53.7%<review>The oldest Ardmore I have tasted. Smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (The entry level Ardmore “Traditional” is at the opposite end of the age spectrum, tasting quite youthful.) My initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral, smoky notes I enjoy so much with Ardmore? The wood is certainly present, but the smoke still comes through. There’s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee, deep caramel, subtle honey), licorice root, bourbon barrel char, coffee grounds, and high cocoa chocolate, with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. Dry finish, with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Considering that Ardmore has historically been a blending malt, most of the stocks right now are much younger. This is a rare treat. It’s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s, but it’s still a very enjoyable whisky."
4017,"<price>199<rating>92<whiskey>Wyoming Barrel Strength Bourbon (Barrel 443), 58%<review>An authoritative nose: deep oak structure, cracked corn, warehouse reek. Minty and lively, but deep and almost ponderous at the same time, and not anywhere near as hot as expected. A bare hint of mustiness (which a bit of water helps wash out) keeps it from being truly exceptional, but this verges on greatness. A show-stopper."
4018,"<price>450<rating>94<whiskey>Gelston’s 25 year old, 52.4%<review>Like a delicious bowl of breakfast cereal, this has pecan, cinnamon, and Quaker oats, all wonderfully balanced with oak, barley, vanilla, dry spices, and drizzled runny honey. Savoring this rare aged Irish whiskey laid down by the legendary Frank McHardy delivers sweet butterscotch, vanilla, honey, toasted cinnamon, fresh orange, and barley, all thickly spread at this strength so it really hits home. What a way to start the day! (1,200 bottles)"
4019,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Rabbit Hole Dareringer PX Sherry Cask-Finished Bourbon, 46.5%<review>A potpourri of herbs, dried flowers, licorice, candied lemon peel, baklava, and furniture polish on the nose. The palate shows some minerality and is a bit bitter, but has prominent blueberry, grape, and boysenberry flavors, along with licorice, coriander seed, mint, and oak spice. It finishes with dark fruit, menthol, licorice, roasted nuts, and plenty of oak. Takes water well."
4020,"<price>48<rating>84<whiskey>Deerhammer Down Time (Batch 3), 46%<review>Another American single malt, from Colorado. A meaty, savory aroma, with molasses cookie and herbal cough drop underneath. Roughly sweet in the mouth, with hints of smoke and bitter chocolate, sweet orange and stewed apples, with a strong back note of anise. For all the strange name and really strange logo (antlers on a barrel?), this is not bad at all."
4021,"<price>415<rating>95<whiskey>Redbreast 20 year old Dream Cask Pedro Ximénez Edition, 52.5%<review>Following one of 2018’s most collectible releases, this vatting of four mature pot still whiskeys finished in a PX butt is quite a departure for Redbreast. The nose has incredible depth, with dark, sticky, concentrated black cherry, candied peel, coriander leaf, vanilla, allspice, clove, and whole almond. This heavy, unctuous, mouth-coating whiskey resonates with rich fruits, clove, licorice, and juicy blackberry, ending with pot still spice and bitter notes. (924 bottles) €380"
4022,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>A.D. Laws Secale Bottled in Bond Straight Rye (Batch BBL #4), 50%<review>A nice jolt of violets, pepper, and sawn oak on the nose is underscored by some green stick and leafy sassafras notes, turning a bit more dark and chewy on the palate, with caramel, figgy fruit, green peppercorns, and a long and bold finish dominated by dark chocolate. Softens up nicely with water, and reveals more fruitiness."
4023,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey>Old Grand-Dad Bonded, 50%<review>The new packaging of Old Grand-Dad doesn’t say bottled in bond, but only “bonded.” At first look, the impression is not good. The straw color makes me think it’s young. Then grains burst out of the glass with a hint of mint. Is this repackaged young whiskey? Then, to my surprise, an explosion. Baking spices, freshly baked bread, and cinnamon roll bring this whiskey home. I’d love to taste it after a few more years in the barrel, but it’s mighty tasty as it is now."
4024,"<price>23<rating>80<whiskey>Old Forester, 43%<review>With a mashbill of 72/18/10% (corn/rye/malted barley), Old Forester offers a traditional recipe in a contemporary proof. Ponder the basics: caramel and vanilla with hints of herbs and baking spices. Promise shows in pumpkin spice, custard, and burnt caramel, but there’s an unwanted high-alcohol note that dulls much of the sweeter taste. Its final moments are saved with hints of cinnamon. Good value bourbon."
4025,"<price>356<rating>92<whiskey>Midleton 1991 Single Cask, 55.2%<review>From this first-fill bourbon cask emerge light, delicate, aromatic fruits: think white peach, poached pear, and lychee with creamed coconut, nutmeg-spiced latte, Simnel cake, Chinese five-spice, and richer apple notes. A seemingly chaste dram that begins with honey, egg-washed brioche, stewed pears, and slender pink rhubarb before innocence is lost as sweet bursts of fruit explode, while dark vanilla, clove, rum and raisin, chocolate, and rye divert the action. Dried apple with Christmas spices marks the finish. (186 bottles, The Whisky Exchange only) £245"
4026,"<price>26<rating>84<whiskey>Redemption Rye (Batch 2), 46%<review>The back label of this whiskey describes it as “feisty,” and feisty it is! Brandishing 95% rye (another Canadian flavoring whisky that was diverted?), bottled at 46%, and at a relatively young age (around two years old), this whiskey lets you know you are alive. It’s very spicy, with crisp evergreen, warming cinnamon, clove, rooty licorice, dark chocolate, and suggestions of gin botanicals. Spicy, vibrant finish. I’m having fun drinking this au naturel (the whiskey, that is), but this would also zing in a cocktail, the same way smoky Islay whiskies make their presence known in a blended scotch. Value Pick."
4027,"<price>45<rating>81<whiskey>Glen Grant, 10 year old, 43%<review>Light (for a Speysider), floral, fresh, and elegant, showing honeyed vanilla and lively fruit, along with a hint of marshmallow and hay. Soft, dry finish. Pleasant, straightforward, and uncomplicated. A good clean introductory malt that’s easy to embrace.

4028,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Seagram’s VO Gold, 40%<review>Darker gold in the glass than regular VO, but sporting that same VO nose of caramel and dry corn. Fuller grain sweetness in the mouth, with some nice light fruitiness—white peach, seckel pear—coming out, and there’s a sweet cinnamon smear along the roof of the mouth. Dries significantly toward the end, and finishes quickly, but with everything in good order."
4029,"<price>2200<rating>93<whiskey>Brora 38 year old, 48.6%<review>Another Special Releases staple, this is the fifteenth and oldest Brora in the series to date. The nose offers hemp, oiled brown paper, lemon juice, ashy peat, and sweetening malt. The oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes, peaty toffee, and ginger. Long in the softly smoky finish, with black pepper, plain chocolate, char, and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2,984 bottles)"
4030,"<price>35000<rating>94<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare Silent Distillery Collection Chapter One, 51.2%<review>Powerfully smoky for 45 years old, with charcoal, burnt turf, smoked venison, dark chocolate, Brazil-nut dark toffee, roasted chestnut, and a hint of smoked haddock. Thick golden syrup, peppery spice, and vanilla caramel; the peat smoke is heavier initially, then fades and darts between other flavors. Toasted oak, dark sugars, cocoa, and smoke finish an incredible sip of Irish whiskey liquid history. (48 bottles) Collectible"
4031,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Rampur Select, 43%<review>Indian single malt distillers like Amrut and Paul John turn out first-rate whiskies that measure up to the most venerable names in scotch. Rampur, a single malt from Radico Khaitan Distillery in the foothills of the Himalayas, is the newest ambassador for this blossoming whisky nation. Indian-grown six-row barley provides biscuity malt aromas that undergird a cornucopia of tropical melon, papaya, and soft yellow jackfruit. The oily palate coats the mouth with cocoa, grilled pineapples, hibiscus blossoms, and tingling spices. With its exceptional, long finish, Rampur may set America on a path to truly appreciating Indian whisky’s style and terroir. Number 5 in the 2017 Top 20

4032,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay (2020 Release), 50%<review>
The nose opens with relatively light sweet woodsmoke, then red apples, sherry, iodine, sea salt, and lively spices emerge. Spicy citrus fruits, toffee, and more sweet smoke on the palate. The finish carries citrus fruits, with sherry, spice, and peat smoke. (12,400 bottles, 1,440 for U.S.)"
4033,"<price>140<rating>91<whiskey>The Irishman Vintage Cask (2020 Release), 55.2%<review>Highly fragrant and floral, this single pot still and single malt blend exudes notes of vanilla fudge, lemon and lime zest, fresh fruit salad, watermelon, and green herbs. The full-bodied palate blasts a comet of orange across a night sky of vanilla, light spices, sponge cake, apricot tart, and stone fruit pastries, with a finish of spice and creamy orange fondant. If anything, it’s even more expressive with water. (3,500 bottles, 750 for U.S.)"
4034,"<price>46<rating>72<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection (Made with Oats), 45%<review>Perhaps my least favorite of all the Experimental Collection releases to date. The nose shows nicely, but it comes across as rather aggressive and harsh on the palate toward the finish, which the label describes as being “earthy.” Otherwise, the whiskey is pleasantly sweet, with molasses, date, and fig, plus charcoal, leather, and bitter resin in the mix. Price is per 375 ml.  "
4035,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2016, 48.5%<review>Complexity right off. Cherry candied nuance, smoke, caramel, French toast, vanilla, and apricot, but then an explosion of marzipan coats the palate with vanilla, freshly baked rye bread, and hints of brown sugar, nutmeg, toasted almond, and bittersweet chocolate. Finally, cherry cola and herbs walk you to a lovely, long, bitter finish with warm undertones. This is a year-round front porch sipper."
4036,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Bushmills Sherry Cask #7430, 53.7%<review>The fruitiest of the three. Notes of ripe fruit, candied almonds, treacle and toffee. Dry, spicy oak notes on the finish. Rich and thick in texture, but not to the point of being cloying. And while the sherry notes are prominent throughout, they do not dominate like many other Scotch and Irish whiskeys. It’s well balanced and very enjoyable. Save this one for after dinner."
4037,"<price>40<rating>77<whiskey>New England Corn Whiskey, 43%<review>Berkshire Mountain Distillers uses locally grown corn here, aged on local oak and cherry wood. The nose is sweet and sharp, smelling of corn, grass, and tart cherries. Corn and ash dominate the hot, slippery mouth, with a finish that turns sweeter as it dwindles, with some faint fruit notes, but the heat is hard to overcome. If it were my corn, I’d put it into the bourbon instead; this is a bit thin. "
4038,"<price>24<rating>83<whiskey>Jim Beam “Devil’s Cut,” 45%<review>More wood influence than the standard Jim Beam White Label. It’s a bit more robust, bolder, and with more wood spices (especially cinnamon and vanilla) and a curious botanical note. Throw in some corn, caramel, and honey, and this is what you get. Behind all that, I’m detecting a bit of youthfulness — I might like this bourbon with more age and less “devil.”"
4039,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>WhistlePig PiggyBack 6 year old, 48.28%<review>A lively nose with scents of orange peel, wild strawberries, pepper spice, and herbal tea. The palate presents a balanced offering of cream, orange Creamsicle, and bitter chocolate, all overlaid with a ring of white pepper. The finish is long and silky, with more vanilla, some orange oil, sweet oak, and a hint of jalapeño pepper. Youthful and fresh for its age, with a lively complexity and bold character."
4040,"<price>22<rating>85<whiskey>Clontarf 1014 Classic Blend, 40%<review>Named after the Irish victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, this has a nose of vanilla, dusty spices, old sweet-shop toffee, dried banana, and polished wood furniture. While the tasty palate comprises fresh green apple, pear, citrus fruits, vanilla, boiled candies, and an appealing lift of spice, this would be tastier still with a bit more weight behind it."
4041,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>GlenDronach Sauternes Finish 14 year old, 46%<review>The rich, sweet Sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. Quite lush, with golden raisin, crème brûlée, rhubarb pie, honey-kissed citrus, and creamy vanilla. A lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting, warming, and embracing. (I would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes, fresh fruit, and maple syrup.) "
4042,"<price>56<rating>87<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1989, 43%<review>Amber gold color. Rich, honeyed malt in aroma. Quite floral, with subtle notes of dried fruit. Full, rich body. Very malty flavors, with notes of honeyed fruit up front, turning dry on the finish with notes of oak, vanilla, and dried fruit. 
"
4043,"<price>99<rating>89<whiskey>Puni Sole, 46%<review>A decent progression of flavor, with PX cask influences: heather honey, toasted oat and sultana granola, hearty prune and fig notes, vanilla essence, roasted spices, peppercorn, and baked ginger loaf. Plenty of flavor here, but it needs more body to complete the experience; golden syrup, spices arrive and depart quickly, leaving oozy caramel, cereal bars, dried and tropical fruits, fruitcake, and nutmeg, ending with bramble, black cherry, and peppery spice."
4044,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Maker’s Mark Cask Strength Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch 19-01), 54.4%<review>The nose offers bold notes of cocoa powder, brown sugar, peanuts, licorice, cherry pie, vanilla ice cream, and baking spice. The palate is creamy, with chocolate fudge, almonds, and shortbread, along with earthier notes of drying oak, old leather, and tobacco leaf. Cracked walnuts on the finish, along with almonds, chocolate, toasted oak, orange, and tea leaves. Lots of sweetness, spice, and nuttiness, all ringed by a hint of black pepper. (12,000 bottles)"
4045,"<price>105<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular 1995 (distilled at Glen Garioch), 51.5%<review>Distilled in September 1995, and after 20 years maturing in a refill hogshead this Aberdeenshire single malt was bottled in February 2016. The nose is soft, with ginger, lots of floral notes, cinnamon, and vanilla. Sweet and malty on the mature palate, with banana, honey, milk chocolate, and cocoa, plus big cinnamon and nutmeg spice notes. Drying in the finish, with a drizzle of lemon juice and then black pepper. (254 bottles) £80"

Plenty of vanilla, along with a hint of ginger spice zing. Clean, nicely rounded, and fully mature for its age."
4047,"<price>47<rating>84<whiskey>North of 7, 45%<review>A mash of 95% local rye and 5% malted barley is distilled on the grain, then matured for 3-plus years in new, custom toasted, full-sized bourbon barrels. Expect loads of vanilla and bold barrel notes over dry grass and nutty clean grain. Despite the hot, spicy intensity, lovely mild sweet lemon notes come right to the front. Bottled barrel by barrel, so expect some minor variability. Look for a red stripe on the label. (Canada only) $60 CAD"
4048,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss “A Matter of Smoke” 15 year old, 46%<review>Peat smoke indeed, and it dovetails nicely with light toffee, vanilla, anise, charred oak, blackberry, seaweed, kalamata olive, brine, and peppercorn. Well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish, and very exciting. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
4049,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Glengoyne 15 year old, 43%<review>Glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement, and this 15 year old was added. Maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla, ginger, toffee, vintage cars’ leather seats, and sweet fruit notes. The somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices, raisins, hazelnuts, and oak. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end, with cocoa powder. £48"
4050,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Drum, 46%<review>This Ardbeg Day 2019 bottling was aged in bourbon barrels before a period of finishing in rum casks. Characteristic Ardbeg citrus and smoke on the nose, but with the addition of green figs, eucalyptus, antiseptic, and brine. Very smooth on the palate, with woodsmoke, mango, and papaya. Big peat and black pepper notes in the finish, underscored by tangy citrus. Ultimately, ashy smoke."
4051,"<price>480<rating>88<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Casks 1985 (Cask #2591), 45.4%<review>A refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color, and indeed notes of that nut as well. Here’s Glenfarclas at its most dense, with savory, sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. The mouth is elegant with a little heat, the sherry giving roasted almond, sweet plump dried fruits, and dried flowers. Water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but, again, not aggressively) and good layering. Similar to the ’87. £285"
4052,"<price>40<rating>93<whiskey>Hancock’s Single Barrel Reserve, 44.45%<review>A 7 year old single barrel. Fruit and flowers jump out of the glass, with caramel popcorn and dried apricot not far behind. Caramel, berry fruit, and baking spices develop into complex and rounded notes of crème brûlée, blackberries, blueberry pie, burnt brown sugar, coconut, and pumpkin pie with extra nutmeg. Long finish delivers a hint of peach cobbler crust. The perfect example of a below 90-proof whiskey with complexity. (Liquor Barn Springhurst exclusive)"
4053,"<price>38<rating>88<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Quite confectionery and billowing with fruity candies—banana taffy, bubble gum, Pixy Stix, red cinnamon gumdrops, and Swedish Fish. The palate offers black cherry soda, more banana, and a bit of grapefruit. Very fruity, with just enough oak to deliver a drying finish. Fans of Jack will be like kids in the candy store, with the added proof and intensity. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4054,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Aultmore) 9 year old, 62.2%<review>Aged in bourbon wood, then finished in an oloroso sherry cask. The result is a whisky with a nutty nose, plus sultanas, figs, vanilla, and background sherry, becoming more floral in time. Full-bodied on the palate, with sweet sherry notes, ginger, and cinnamon, and developing raisin and prune notes. The finish is long, with spicy coffee and blackberries. (Cask no. 900160)"
4055,"<price>43<rating>89<whiskey>The Dead Rabbit, 44%<review>Co-founders of New York’s The Dead Rabbit Bar Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry add their own 5 year old single malt and grain whiskeys to their supplies of grog. Sweetness, caramel, vanilla, and scents of dried fruits. The flavors captured in a light frame reveal citrus peel, malt, dark cookies, a rumble of spice, and conclude with dried peels dipped in chocolate. Drying, with spice and orange. Decent whiskey for sure, but a rather conservative first release for The Dead Rabbit."
4056,"<price>200<rating>88<whiskey>The Exclusive Blend 35 year old 1980, 46%<review>If you like sherried malts, you’ll love this! Bottled at a respectable strength too. Red apple, cherry skins, strawberry, raspberry, Eccles cake, malt loaf, and warming spices; there’s a lot to get your nose into here. A finely structured dram, with soft leather, rhubarb, Bramley apple, cherryade, fresh Victoria plum, pepper, and muted ginger deliver sustained flavors. A long, spicy, and peeled fruit finish. Given the distillery closures in 1983, there could be some interesting components in here. (464 bottles)"
4057,"<price>45<rating>90<whiskey>Clan Denny Islay, 46%<review>It's not made clear which Islay malts are included in this blended malt, but whoever's responsible for this has brought the big guns. This successfully pulls off an intense one-two, with hard hitting Islay peat and brine on the one hand, and some rich sweetness on the other, making for a mouth-coatingly rich and intense whisky. The malts pack down together like a rugby scrum and combine with impressive intensity. €36"
4058,"<price>588<rating>94<whiskey>Teeling 28 year old Vintage Reserve, 46%<review>After marrying in sauternes casks for many years, this bourbon-matured 1991
distillate has become epic stuff. Aromas of dried apricot, cooked apple, roasted
aromatic spices, red grape, candied peel, dried fig, smoked butter, and singed
fruitcake. The palate purrs like a contented cat. It’s dark and syrupy, with treacle,
cooked plum, a touch of peppery spice, and a medicinal finish of cough drops and
aniseed. (4,000 bottles) €500"
4059,"<price>200<rating>93<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength Port Barrel-Finished Bourbon (2019 Release), 61.2%<review>An enchanting and somewhat racy nose, with blackberries, cherries, concord grapes, brown sugar, apple crumble, leather, iced tea, and polished oak; though the port finish is evident, it doesn’t smother the bourbon’s core character, which comes through with corn muffin and peanuts. Nutty grain asserts itself on the palate as well, set off by dark fruit and chocolate, ample spice, pecan pie, and cherry cough syrup. The lengthy finish is peppery, and pops with chocolate, cough syrup, roasted pecans, and warm spices. (14,000 bottles) Collectibles"
4060,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Old Line Cask Strength American Single Malt (Batch 1M), 60%<review>Sweet and lightly smoky on the nose: toasted marshmallow, campfire logs, Sugar Babies, dried orange rind, Nilla Wafer, smoked almonds, and rich hot chocolate. Without water, the proof shows itself, but add a few drops and what was a dry brush fire is now smoked chili-chocolate, cinnamon, black pepper, orange oil, almonds, and a little bacon. Ashy and sweet on the finish, with chili heat, orange, nuts, and chocolate. Potentially divisive in its profile, but its powerful character is undeniable."
4061,"<price>89<rating>90<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Rye (batch PSH3), 45%<review>Insights developed from four generations making fine California wine are applied brilliantly to Masterson’s 100% rye-grain whisky. Finishing in Hungarian oak barrels lends softness to warm glowing spices, ripe Bing cherries, Granny Smith apples, and cocoa powder. Sandalwood follows, then Humbugs, farmy notes, sweet grainy beer mash, fragrant esters, and candy canes, on a slippery palate. Long, spicy, vanilla finish."
4062,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Pure Kentucky XO, Batch 03-20, 53.5%<review>XO refers to extra old, and this bourbon certainly is that. When compared to Kentucky Vintage, it’s drier, spicier, and more intense on the palate-even when its higher proof is diluted with water. Firm mint, resinous oak, leather, and even a waft of cigar smoke are the highlights of this bourbon. Long, dry, spicy finish and a bit fiery. For those who like a big, bold, oak-influenced bourbon. 
"
4063,"<price>140<rating>93<whiskey>The Scotch Malt Whisky Society Pigs in Plaster 14 year old (#4.1980), 59.1%<review>This single cask, distilled at Highland Park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park's signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. A smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster whisky, different from Highland Park's style, but very interesting. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
4064,"<price>2000<rating>86<whiskey>J.J. Corry The Vatting No. 2, 47%<review>The nose is a bit reticent, starting with baked apple heaped with peppery spice, then discarded coils of apple peels, with hints of date, roast beef, and peanut, but it never really takes off. A tasty autumnal dram with rich savory juices, cooked apple, dark toffee, and background oakiness, with the stewed juices of plums, prunes, and raspberries squaring off against a wave of spices. (60 bottles)"
4065,"<price>35<rating>65<whiskey>Iowa Legendary Rye, 40%<review>An unaged whiskey from Carroll County, Iowa, with rye grain and sugar mash. The nose is all kinds of barnyard funk: hay, horse, and manure. Underneath is a bite of sugar and vanilla. On the palate it’s less funky, with sugar, strawberry, and a grappa-like note. The rye spice emerges mid-palate, but it’s fleeting and leads to an edgy and fractured finish. Time in oak might help, but there are issues here that wood won’t resolve."
4066,"<price>5000<rating>92<whiskey>The Dalmore 35 year old, 40%<review>This is comprised of whisky aged in a bourbon barrel, a 30 year old Matusalem sherry butt, and a Colheita port pipe. Figs and malt on the early nose; resinous, with tangerines, vanilla, and soft leather. Slightly thin on the palate, but very smooth, with spiced orange, dates, and coffee grounds. Dries very slowly in the finish, with persistent orange, a sprinkling of black pepper, and a suggestion of mouth-drying oak. (1,000 bottles per year for five years)"
4067,"<price>128<rating>83<whiskey>Stauning Traditional 2nd Edition, 55%<review>Denmark often seems to live in the shadow of Sweden, and certainly that has been the case with whisky. But slowly and surely a revolution is happening there, and I suspect that Stauning will be right at the forefront of it. This is another work in progress: pleasant, well made, and potentially very good indeed. The dominant flavors are gooseberry, sour apple, and pepper. Good as an aperitif. 695 Krone/500 ml"
4068,"<price>99<rating>87<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Double Matured 16 year old Vic Lee Edition, 40%<review>Just eight whiskies in the blend, married and finished in first fill Spanish sherry and bourbon casks. An insistent nose, crackling with spices, with toasted Eccles cake anointed with grated nutmeg, vanilla extract, cassia, and dark soy sauce. Light honey and vanilla, tangerine oils, and lime peel exhibit perfectly-paced development, with flavor building over a minute or more. Warming ginger, spices, and tropical fruits of guava and papaya close out this first annual special edition. Impressive work."
4069,"<price>300<rating>80<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Invergordon) 50 year old, 42.9%<review>You can smell the time that has elapsed on this dark, chestnut dram. Glimpses of vanilla essence, mushroom gills, blueberries, aged balsamic vinegar, and beef stock. Flavors swirl around charred meat juices, walnut oil, chewed leather, rancio, tobacco leaf, tree bark, black toffee, and licorice root. A slight creamy salvation tugs it from its oaky and savory comfort zone. The moderate finish is awash with Brazil nut and bitter coffee grounds. Forget about adding water. An ancient, fragile grain whisky. (K&L Wines exclusive)"
4070,"<price>70<rating>84<whiskey>Glenkinchie Distillers Edition 1996, 43%<review>Amontillado casks are used here, which add a certain almond-like note to the nose, as well as more obvious oakiness. The effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. The dry notes have gone, replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors. The fresh meadow flowers are more like cut flowers in a florist shop, the fruits hint toward peach, and there’s a new citric burst on the finish."
4071,"<price>700<rating>94<whiskey>GlenDronach Grandeur 31 year old, 45.8%<review>The new ultra-mature release, following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It’s nice to see the higher ABV, given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it’s sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it)."
4072,"<price>21<rating>81<whiskey>JP Wiser<review>Burnt caramel, sweet—almost candied—but not cloying, the whisky quickly develops fiery blasts of pepper that linger long on the sides of your tongue. As the heat builds, caramel melts into barley sugar, which in turn fades into bitter citrus pith. Flinty hard rye and vague barrel tones never let us forget that this is whisky: whisky enhanced with vanilla and spices that a probing palate might have found anyway in the unflavored dram."
4073,"<price>140<rating>91<whiskey>Orphan Barrel Rhetoric 25 year old, 45.5%<review>A platform of caramel sweetness comes draped in lovely oak spice with dried flower potpourri—like rose petals and an old-lady’s perfume—along with horehound, cedary oak, and iced tea. The palate veers toward dried fruits—apple rings and dates—with bitter orange peel and a beam of spice that turns peppery on the long finish of tobacco and cedar. The overall impression is lithe, upright, and stately."
4074,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Edradour 'Ballechin (#4),' 46%<review>The fourth release of peated Edradour whisky. This time it’s aged in oloroso sherry casks. There’s a lot going on in this whisky. Yeah, it’s still a little on the young side, but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. A distinctive whisky, with coal tar, damp kiln smoke, caramelized fruit, smoked almond, walnut, licorice stick, and maple-cured bacon. Youthful, sweet, smoky, lingering finish. I’m looking forward to future releases. (6,000 bottles released, but only 900 to the U.S.). 
"
4075,"<price>42<rating>87<whiskey>Hankey Bannister Heritage Blend, 46%<review>Hankey Bannister includes some stunning aged whiskies in its range, but given the trend toward unaged scotch releases, I was a bit suspicious of this. It lacks depth but nevertheless is a butterfly in a breeze of a whisky; gossamer light, both tantalizing and elusive. It’s liquid honey, with sweet lime and pear, some cocoa, and to give it a modicum of depth, it’s underpinned
by a light saltiness."
4076,"<price>124<rating>87<whiskey>Swiss Highland Classic, 46%<review>From the Rugen distillery in Interlaken, this was filled into American oak oloroso sherry butts and rolled into the Rugen Mountain rock cellars that were built in 1875.  Almond, glacé cherry, apricot, wood spices, and nougat create a very active nose. A lightness of touch, with vanilla, honey, strawberry, and raspberry make for a juicy mouthfeel, despite a swell of black pepper and ginger. It just grows and grows. The fresh fruits seem impervious to the dying spices. CHF119"
4077,"<price>15<rating>82<whiskey>Bowman’s Canadian, 40%<review>The freshly opened bottle smells promising, with spirit, toffee, suggestions of cloves, a blast of steely rye, and grapefruit juice on the nose. On the palate it is sweet, somewhat hot, slightly perfumed, and overall, quite simple. A lovely glow in the back of the mouth and on the tongue doesn’t last, but is replaced by hints of caramel and citrus fruit. Good, solid session whisky."
4078,"<price>76<rating>84<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glentauchers) 17 year old, 48.8%<review>It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed."
4079,"<price>196<rating>86<whiskey>Nikka Coffey Grain single cask 1999, 60%<review>Distilled, as the name suggests, in a (Glasgow-built) Coffey still at the Miyagikyo distillery, here we have a corn-based grain with masses of gentle custard tart aromas alongside peach and corn fatness. The mouth is ripe and slow, with banana skin and fruit peels leading to a mellow mid-palate section, where vanilla comes through. It’s all about the feel. €145"
4080,"<price>120<rating>88<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 2001 (distilled at Bowmore), 58.4%<review>A sweet start, then a sudden blast of fresh, menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again, nice), a mashy note, then violet-accented smoke. Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate, where there’s toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. The finish is all hot peppered mackerel. Recommended. (U.S. only)"
4081,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>The Busker Triple Cask Triple Smooth, 40%<review>
Royal Oak Distillery’s flagship has a nose of ripe mango, dried apple rings, vanilla, and fine spice, with a curious additional note somewhere between pencil erasers and a tire repair kit. Its light-bodied frame showcases apple pie, sweet cream, caramel, gingerbread, custard, and vanilla. Although no prizes for guessing this is a blend of malt, grain, and single pot still whiskeys, it is refreshing and easy to drink."
4082,"<price>290<rating>89<whiskey>Tomintoul 33 year old, 43%<review>Younger Tomintoul whiskies are fairly straightforward, unassuming whiskies. Older expressions show more depth. What they all seem to have is a remarkable balance. Moreover, this whisky and its predecessor, the 27 year old, are surprisingly delicate and nimble for their age. This is an elegant whisky, with a toffee foundation, creamy vanilla, nougat, light summer fruits, a kiss of molasses, and gentle spice (cinnamon, mocha). Soft finish. Very pleasing.

4083,"<price>28<rating>88<whiskey>Aerstone Sea Cask 10 year old, 40%<review>A William Grant & Sons single malt from an undisclosed Lowland distillery. It offers flavors of mashed turnip sprinkled with table salt early on the nose; brittle toffee, malt, and vanilla aromas develop. Creamy toffee, more salt, honey, orange fondant, and sweet oak on the palate. The lengthy finish features gentle spices, oak, and white pepper. £22"
4084,"<price>20<rating>84<whiskey>Cascade Blonde American Whiskey, 40%<review>Oak-forward with gentle sweetness and light in body, this is a simple and enjoyable enough, with straightforward vanilla and toasted nuts.

4085,"<price>80<rating>77<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye Batch B12E2, 58%<review>Single barrel, cask proof. Strong wood aromas; pencil shavings, hot-sawn oak. Hot and tight, intense wood. There’s some interesting stuff around the edges, but the wood’s blocking it till some sweetness peeks through at the end. Water helps a little, but not enough. Over-barreled."
4086,"<price>15<rating>79<whiskey>Potter’s Crown, 40%<review>Dusty on the nose with increasing caramel notes. A bit spirity. A semi-sweet palate with initially mild peppers flickers into a pleasing, gingery glow. Suggestions of bitterness in the middle are subdued by increasing sweetness. Simple, but very nice. Caramel notes quickly become hot and peppery, then a smooth oiliness soothes the palate until it ends on a peppery and barely bitter finish. A great mixer with ginger ale."
4087,"<price>80<rating>79<whiskey>Highland Park 1990 vintage 15 year old (Cask #10132), 56.3%<review>Lushly fruity and quite sweet. A bit too sappy on the nose, but more even-keeled on the palate. The fruit notes (nectarine, plum, orange marmalade) sit on a bed of caramel, shortbread, and thick honey, with chocolate-covered almonds emerging on the finish. For those who like their Highland Park youthful and very sherried. (Bottled for Grape Vine Market)"
4088,"<price>59<rating>88<whiskey>Paul John Brilliance, 46%<review>Paul John is taking its entry into the world of single malt very seriously, and very slowly but surely. After two single cask offerings to find its range, Brilliance and Edited are its first general releases. Brilliance is unpeated and is a delight: rich, full, young but not immature, and with lime and citrus Starburst chews, sweet candy, and some icing sugar, it trips across the palate. Conclusive proof that Amrut isn’t the only Indian game in town."
4089,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Hazelburn 12 year old, 46%<review>Following on from the earlier 8 year old expression of this triple distilled Campbeltown malt, the 12 year old first appeared in August 2009 and nicely illustrates the developments brought about by its continuing maturation. Rich on the nose, with a clear sherry influence, along with toffee, marzipan, apricots, and milk chocolate. This is a substantial and well integrated dram, with malt, almonds, cocoa, and spice on the palate, while the long, spicy finish offers more chocolate, soft fruits, and coffee."
4090,"<price>117<rating>83<whiskey>Bruichladdich Micro Provenance 2007 (Cask 14), 63.6%<review>The Micro Provenance series is Bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. This is made from barley grown on Rockside Farm (now owned by Kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. The oak doesn’t dominate the nose, allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop, along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. The palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. Fresh, balanced, and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90"
4091,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Moray 18 year old, 47.2%<review>This offers a slightly oily nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, cocoa powder, nutmeg, cucumber sprinkled with white pepper, and very subtle smoke. Powerful flavors of peppery fruit and malt on the palate, with honey, butterscotch, milk chocolate, cinnamon, and mellow oak. The finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples."
4092,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Mayor Pingree Red Label Straight (Batch No. 001), 47%<review>Herbal, citrus, and subtle oak aromas mingle with grape soda, ground ginger, iced tea, and cinnamon Teddy Grahams on the nose. Medium-bodied and well-spiced, it’s a little hot, but softens with water and develops nicely in the glass, showing flavors of chocolate, nuts, grape jelly, and blueberry compote. The finish is sweet with cooked berries, chocolate, oak, and subtle spice. Made by Valentine Distilling Co. in Ferndale, Michigan."
4093,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Caribou Crossing Single Barrel, 40%<review>Those of you who think Canadian whiskies are thin and bland should give this one a try. No, it’s not a new concept, like Forty Creek. It’s still very much a “traditional” Canadian. But when compared to most Canadian whiskies, it’s richer, creamier, and velvety smooth. The flavors are straightforward — primarily vanilla, with some crème brûlée, toasted marshmallow, tangerine, peaches and cream, and gentle rye spice — but they are clean and well-balanced. A delicious, lighter-style whisky."
4094,"<price>6400<rating>85<whiskey>The Dalmore 1980 31 year old, 52.1%<review>This 1980 expression of The Dalmore Constellation has been solely matured in a Gonzales Byass Apostoles oloroso sherry butt. The resultant whisky is sweet on the nose, with dates, figs, milk chocolate-covered caramel, and finally a suggestion of eucalyptus. Briefly fruity on the palate, becoming bitter, with dark coffee notes. Long and spicy in the finish, with black pepper and licorice. Cask number 2140; 227 bottles."
4095,"<price>99<rating>90<whiskey>Loch Lomond 18 year old, 46%<review>The 18 year old is Loch Lomond’s flagship single malt and marks the improvement in quality from this distillery during recent years. The nose offers peaches and vanilla, mild spice, pipe tobacco, and a hint of sweet wood smoke. Nicely textured, with bold, sweet, citrus fruit flavors, vanilla, almonds, and cocoa. Nutty, gently spicy, with cocoa and a hint of coffee in the lengthy, subtly peated finish."
4096,"<price>38<rating>84<whiskey>Ryan & Wood Straight Rye, 43%<review>Rye grain, fresh-sawn wood, and a hint of brittle sugar. No corn here: the mashbill is rye, wheat, and malt. Bitter rye edge drives this into the palate, blowing open space for the smoother body to follow and briefly sweeten things up before the rye warp collapses in an oily, spicy, savory finish. Quite discreet and small-scale; this doesn't roar, it urges. Good, but it needs more breadth and wood depth to be great. (Massachusetts only.)"
4097,"<price>130<rating>87<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Oat Grain Straight Bourbon, 42.5%<review>The oak juts out a bit in this otherwise fresh and pleasant bourbon, where toasted oak meets cake batter, Honey Nut Cheerios, and porridge with pecans. It’s lacking much in the way of a ‘wow factor,’ but following the slightly tart fruit palate is a redeeming finish, balancing tasty apricot and bright citrus peel with drying oak tannins."
4098,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Amrut Two Continents (Second Edition), 50%<review>Two Continents refers to the fact that this is matured in India and then Europe. But Amrut has tweaked the winning formula of the first edition, taking the alcoholic strength from 46% to 50% and using bourbon instead of grain casks for European maturation. The changes are immediately noticeable. The nose is honeyed, with key lime pie, and strawberries and cream. The taste is spikier, spicier, and feistier than before, with dark cherry, blood orange, and unripe banana."
4099,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Macallan Edition No. 5, 48.5%<review>Intended to showcase the color of Macallan, the fifth annual Edition release has been aged in a variety of American oak casks. The nose is initially reticent and offers dried fruits, salted caramel, sawdust, and ginger. Extremely smooth on the palate, with more dried fruits, ripe plums, milk chocolate, new leather, and black pepper. The finish is medium in length, with leather and dark chocolate."
4100,"<price>6088<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park 1964 vintage, 42.2%<review>A marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). Significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. Darker (and more serious) in personality, too. Red berries (strawberry, raspberry), rhubarb, plum, oak sap, vanilla bean, smoldering peat, coffee grounds, toasted almond, and dusty malt. The finish is long and contemplative, with notes of polished leather, juicy oak, and telicherry peppercorns. £3,750"
4101,"<price>50<rating>60<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Five Malt, 45.2%<review>Four barley types—two row, pale chocolate, kiln coffee, and Carafa—and malted wheat; aged 6 months in used Woodford Reserve Double Oaked barrels. Initial pungency and varnish. Then freshly-cut grass, petrol, wood shavings, and a slight hint of chocolate. New make mouthfeel. A hint of honey and milk chocolate is quickly overtaken by an astringent finish. In another few years, maybe this will become more palatable, but this is far from ready, and bourbon remains this distiller’s strong suit. 375ml"
4102,"<price>60<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Scotia 10 year old, 46%<review>Lemonade, hints of aniseed, and putty on the nose. Tropical fruits, spice, and milk chocolate on the palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with a hint of licorice. "
4103,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Rossville Union Straight Rye, 47%<review>The nose smells wonderfully chewy, with buttery toffee, candied nuts, charred oak, cracked pepper, and a hint of fresh dill. The palate sings with electric spice and rolls along nicely with stone fruit, peppercorn, sweet vanilla, and leathery oak, each taking their turn before the slightly hot finish of oak tannins. A blend of 51% and 95% rye mashbills from Indiana’s MGP."
4104,"<price>79<rating>87<whiskey>Tullamore D.E.W. 14 year old, 41.3%<review>Following a 6 month period of finishing in the same four cask types as its older sibling (see above) we get a fruity nose of cherry lips, black currant juice, brambles, Cox’s orange pippin, taffy candy, and the citrus acidity of oils squeezed from the peel. Oh, it’s sweet, syrupy, and spicy; a fruity cocktail of apple and strawberry. Diminishing spice and bright rustic apples usher in a rewarding finish. A complex and distinctive recipe, for sure. €70"
4105,"<price>140<rating>89<whiskey>Caol Ila Unpeated 1997 17 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 55.9%<review>Aged in first-fill American oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up."
4106,"<price>75<rating>81<whiskey>Inchmurrin 12 year old, 46%<review>Soft and warm on the nose, with peaches in syrup, heather, hazelnut, and mild ginger. Quite full and richly fruity on the palate: apricots and more peaches, plus stronger ginger and a hint of spicy oak. Lingering in the sweet finish, with gentle spices."
4107,"<price>325<rating>84<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Amontillado 16 year old, 54%<review>Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (Fèis Ìle 2016, 250 bottles) £250"
4108,"<price>43<rating>86<whiskey>McKenzie Straight Bourbon, 45.5%<review>Vibrantly fruity with strawberry and orange Creamsicle on the nose, along with clean hay, toasted oak, cinnamon, caramel, and bay leaf. Wood spices on the front palate give way to orange custard, pomegranate, caramel, and cinnamon bread notes, with a pop of chili-dusted roasted corn lashed with bitter oak on the finish."
4109,"<price>1250<rating>95<whiskey>Glenlivet Cellar Collection 1973 vintage, 49%<review>A marriage of three casks, one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident, and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive, with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges, ripe peach, and hints of pineapple and coconut), caramel-coated nuts, and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating, soothing finish. Polished and seamless, with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S., beginning June 2010.)"
4110,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Lost Spirits Abomination The Sayers of the Law, 54%<review>Aromas of smoked meat, kelp, saline, rubber, and butterscotch pudding make for a sweet and savory first impression. Flavors of burnt sugar, vanilla custard, cooked apple, dark cacao, black pepper, and salty umami carry through on a big, aggressive, hunger-sparking palate. The finish is unsweetened chocolate, ash, and pepper—bold and unapologetic, it responds well to water.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;
Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland, then blended, exported, and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of charred oak treated with Riesling wine."
4111,"<price>24<rating>84<whiskey>Ensign Red, 40%<review>Walk into a pastry shop and inhale the aromas of coconut cake, confectioners’ sugar, lemon cream, almond paste, and vanilla. Then take a sip: coconut custard, slivered almonds, vanilla, and sweet bread dough. The grain whisky is at the forefront here, lending simplicity and insistent sweetness. (Total Wine & More)"
4112,"<price>43<rating>86<whiskey>Glynnevan Cabot Triple Barrelled Canadian Rye, 45%<review>By finishing this blend of two sourced whiskies in its own maritime rum barrels, Authentic Seacoast Distillery gives this classic Canadian whisky a somehow tropical twist. Oily molasses undertones on the nose continue onto a spicy palate, which is syrupy but not slippery, with hints of wet slate, bananas, and heavy fruit. Barrel notes and suggestions of dry oak restrain an initially lush mouthfeel. (Nova Scotia only) $55 CAD"
4113,"<price>165<rating>89<whiskey>Single Cask Nation (distilled at Tormore) 21 year old, 49%<review>This was distilled in February 1996, matured in a second-fill bourbon barrel, and bottled in April 2017. The nose yields nectarines, vanilla ice cream, fudge, and milk chocolate. Smooth and rounded on the palate, with ripe apples, toffee, walnuts, and ultimately, a hint of lemon, plus black pepper. Nutty and subtly spicy in the lengthy finish. (156 bottles)"
4114,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Dewar’s 18 year old The Vintage, 40%<review>Vanilla laced with spice, fondant icing, grapefruit peel, and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth, grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla, yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish."
4115,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>Belle Meade Cask Strength Reserve (Batch No. 5), 56.8%<review>Swirls with the smells of a county fair—candy apples, peanuts, caramel, spiced cookies, and old barn boards, redolent with maturity and complexity. More childhood favorites appear on the palate: cinnamon Red Hots, grape soda, blackberry candy, chocolate-covered caramels, candy apple, and roasted corn, with lush oak rounding out into a peppery finish of cherry cola and roasted pecans. Given the barrel proof, this takes water well. Nelson’s Green Brier Distillery bottles the Belle Meade line of bourbons, sourced from MGP Distillery. Each batch of Cask Strength Reserve averages around 1,000 bottles; ABV varies between 55% and 60%. Number 10 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
4116,"<price>57<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich 10 year old, 46%<review>The first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. Lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks, and quite fresh, with a maturity resembling a 12 year old, rather than 10. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable, with creamy vanilla, honeycomb, banana bread, bright lemon, melon (honeydew, cantaloupe), tangerine, candied ginger, and delicate brine. With all the Bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade, we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious Laddie with open arms."
4117,"<price>4350<rating>93<whiskey>The Last Drop 56 year old, 47.2%<review>This release from independent bottler The Last Drop has a captivating aroma of dark toffee, cinnamon, Brazil nut, star anise, polished oak, vanilla seed, crème de cassis, and a wisp of smoke that shows more charred stave as time goes on. Peach and baked orange precede an early peak of spice and smoke, then sit back and swim in the soothing mélange of chocolate brownie, Whoppers, stewed apple, vanilla pod, oak, sultana, and plum jam. (732 bottles) Collectibles"
4118,"<price>1215<rating>90<whiskey>Deanston 40 year old, 45.6%<review>This veteran expression from Deanston Distillery was matured in refill bourbon casks before spending no fewer than 10 years in oloroso sherry butts. Rose petals, fresh pineapple, clotted cream, cinnamon, and dusty oak on the enticing nose. Unctuous in the mouth, with apple pie, cinnamon, hazelnuts, and ginger. Drying slowly to pleasing fruity, tannic notes. Extremely long finish, with a persistent citric tang. (Less than 500 bottles globally)"
4119,"<price>60<rating>79<whiskey>Coppersea Green Malt Barley, 48%<review>Another “green malt” whiskey from Coppersea, a method they found in an old Scottish text for making whiskey from unkilned malt. This is much more vegetal than the rye (reviewed in Summer 2014); rank grass aroma, with a sweetness behind it, without the lovely complexity of the rye. Bitter and stemmy; hot and sweet as it closes. I much prefer the rye."
4120,"<price>37<rating>89<whiskey>Smokey Joe Islay Malt, 46%<review>Like sniffing fine soil running through your fingers, with creamy milk chocolate, baked fruit, mild spices, and pungent, acrid smoke that catches the back of the throat. Baked apple, pear, sultana, and cocoa, but then there’s the smoke: an inferno of caustic, thick peat smoke and astringent pepper, the dark recesses of the mouth beginning to blacken. It’s like throwing a punch in slow motion. Try it. (Total Wine exclusive)"
4121,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Glenlivet Nadurra Triumph 1991, 48%<review>Richly textured with mouth-coating malt that is balanced by an array of lively fruit (fresh peach, nectarine, tangerine, pears in honey, and delicately caramelized pineapple). Creamy caramel, crème brûlée, anise, and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity, as does its gently spicy, pleasingly dry finish. Two years older than the standard 16 year old Nadurra (which I like for its vibrancy and freshness). This new Triumph 1991 is richer and more textured, with more caramelized sugars, riper barley, and greater fruit impact. More mouth-coating too. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
4122,"<price>160<rating>89<whiskey>Blackadder 27 years old (distilled at Bowmore), 50.5%<review>Amber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore whiskies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. Good, lengthy finish. 
Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Availability: only 244 bottles total."
4123,"<price>320<rating>93<whiskey>Midleton Dair Ghaelach Knockrath Forest (Tree 7), 56.5%<review>Vanilla, white pear, meringue, caramel, and lots more toasted oak flavors with nutmeg, clove, and pepper. This is fruity and sweet with orange, pomegranate, and caramel, then a wild, crazy rush of spices. It has a bold and generous nature, moving from lime zest to grapefruit, with dry oak to finish."
4124,"<price>53<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Moray Fired Oak 10 year old, 40%<review>To create Fired Oak, Glen Moray spirit has been matured in bourbon casks for almost a decade, before a 10 month finish in heavily charred virgin American oak casks. Canned pineapple, honey, and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of lemon. An initial citric zest on the palate, then soft toffee, newly sawn timber, cloves, and cinnamon. Licorice, lively spices, and slightly smoky oak in the medium-length finish. £40"
4125,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Breaker Bourbon, 45%<review>This bourbon is a blend of whiskeys aged a minimum of 5 years, with part of that time spent in California's Central Coastal hills. Breaker leads with a strong oak nose supported by cinnamon and caramel. On the palate, the maritime impact is there: it’s softer and less oaky, with a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and a touch of clove. Breaker is a very restrained and understated bourbon, but that’s also what makes it so damn likable. Sourced whiskey."
4126,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Murray McDavid 2010 Peatside 6 year old, 46%<review>The nose is pleasant, with fresh strawberry, spicy smoke, cookie dough, allspice, and glacé cherry, but the palate fails to shine or excite. This has been finished in port and Pedro Ximénez casks, giving the whisky a subtle rose hue, but it needs more body. There are flavors of biscuit, mandarin, vanilla, and redcurrant. It meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory, then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness. (2,266 bottles for U.S.)"
4127,"<price>101<rating>90<whiskey>Kornog Sant Erwan 2016, 50%<review>Every May, Jean Donnay searches for an exceptional single cask to bottle in honor of the patron saint of Brittany. This fresh bourbon barrel was an inspired pick. Summer honey, creamed coconut, honeysuckle blossom, vanilla panna cotta, and an attractive turf-rich peat note leap from the glass. Tart and juicy, with tangerine imbued with peat, its journey takes on a delicious malty and chocolate character, arriving at a delectable final plateau of nutmeg. He’s found superb balance this year. €95"
4128,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Tipperary Boutique Selection Watershed, 47%<review>Fresh and approachable, with lemon curd, green apples, almond, and caramelized brown sugar. Sweet lemon and honey, icing sugar, and little twists of orange peel, then as it relaxes, nougat, nuttiness, Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal flavors, and more creaminess. The finish keeps a grip on the front of the mouth. This sip of Tipp will do me just fine until the family-run distillery is built at Ballindoney Farm."
4129,"<price>142<rating>83<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 26 year old 1988, 46.9%<review>A light golden dram from a refill hoggie, redolent of fragrant honey, custard slices, orange water, perfumed soaps, and fresh spring blossom. Vanilla, dried peel, and shortbread petticoat tails on the palate, that develops with spun sugar flavors. The whole concoction is anchored by a little oak, but the cask has been gentle. The finish is mouth-drawing, but settles down like a well-sucked butterscotch. Mellow and serene. (305 bottles) £91"
4130,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Grand Macnish Sherry Cask 15 year old, 40%<review>Naming your blend “Sherry Cask” retains an air of ambiguity to it. Theoretically, it could be the maturation or finishing vessel for all or some of the constituents. The whisky is light-bodied and the sweet sherry is evident, though a nip of bitterness interrupts. Smoother on the palate than the 12 year old, there’s strawberry, raspberry, and background spice, with a blackberry note late in the finish. Overall, there’s less flavor development, but it’s an old-school kind of blend."
4131,"<price>127<rating>90<whiskey>Mortlach Special Strength, 49%<review>This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. Dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml"
4132,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Tenjaku Blended Japanese Whisky, 40%<review>This blend is made in Fuefuki, west of Tokyo, and seems custom-built for great Highballs. The nose presents fresh pear, baked pastry, straw, and slightly smoky roasted spices: coriander seed, peppercorn, and aniseed ball. It lacks body initially, with sweet orange, fruit syrups, and ginger root spiciness, but then it restores your faith with flavors of tropical fruits, vanilla, and orange cake, and a hot ‘n’ spicy peppery finish."
4133,"<price>50<rating>90<whiskey>Forty Creek Confederation Oak Reserve (Lot 1867-F), 40%<review>Each batch is a little bit different, this one leaning to sweet orchard fruits, nutty barley, and hot spicy rye. Butterscotch and vanilla on the nose translate well onto the palate. Brisk peppery spice underlies developing layers, adding another dimension of complexity to an already broad range of flavors. Hints of oak tannins on the finish remind us this was finished in Canadian wood."
4134,"<price>80<rating>75<whiskey>Edradour Bordeaux Finish, 11 year old, 55.8%<review>Citrus peel, light maple syrup, and almonds, with emerging grape and vanilla. Somewhat elegant in nature, but the flavors do not especially complement each other. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
4135,"<price>90<rating>90<whiskey>Four Roses 12 year old Limited Edition Single Barrel (2011 Release), 50.9%<review>Very floral and fragrant. Gently sweet, too: apple tart laced with cinnamon, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup.  Well-defined oak and crisp, dry spice (cinnamon, anise, cocoa, nutmeg) balance the sweetness. An interesting whiskey: big in some ways, yet elegant in others"
4136,"<price>85<rating>86<whiskey>Old Pulteney Dunnet Head, 46%<review>Dunnet Head replaces Duncansby Head and consists of 80 percent sherry cask-matured whisky and 20 percent aged in bourbon wood. It is non-chill filtered. Soft caramel on the nose, plus a hint of fresh ginger and meadow hay. Sweet, spicy sherry and a heathery note on the nicely textured palate, with suggestions of citrus and salt. Medium in length, with lingering soft spices in the finish; ginger and cinnamon at the close. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4137,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Glenmorangie Bacalta, 46%<review>The 8th Private Edition release. This one is finished in sun-baked casks which previously contained Malmsey Madeira. A predominantly sweet and fruity whisky, with caramel, honeyed almonds, peaches in syrup, and orange scone. Soft, soothing finish. Delicious!"
4138,"<price>20<rating>68<whiskey>Freedom Moonshine Apple Pie Rye, 20%<review>The aromas from the base rye moonshine complement the apple much better here than in Freedom’s other flavored offerings. Baked apple mixes with cinnamon and is supported by a bread undertone. The apple note comes off as just a little too artificial. Like the other Freedom Moonshine products, the entry is too soft and flat. The biggest problem here clearly is the proof. There’s just not enough structure to do anything with this moonshine: mix, ice, or otherwise enjoy."
4139,"<price>59<rating>90<whiskey>Big Peat Christmas (2020 Edition), 53.1%<review>
This is a spicy prospect, with pepper, lemon bonbons, and dense peat smoke, though the toffee and sweet lemon are well-balanced against the smoke. Sweet lemon meringue pie, candied peel, and a twin assault of smoke and clove-led spices on the palate, though the sweetness mounts a fight back. Great crescendo of flavor as Big Peat tries to show he is the perfect house guest for the holidays. (900 bottles for U.S.)"
4140,"<price>225<rating>94<whiskey>Scotch Malt Whisky Society Hunting Hound on Holiday 4.180 24 year old 1989, 51.3%<review>From the nose you can tell this is a special whisky, with old, dark, lacquered wood, dusty cigar box, and sea salt combined with dark sweet cherry and a hint of rancio. On the palate it gets even better, with lush, dark cherry perfectly balanced and integrated with oak spice, salt, and peat smoke. There’s clear rancio in the center of it all that's utterly delicious. This stunner finishes with a long, slightly spicy, and entirely lovely finish. (Park Avenue Liquor only)"
4141,"<price>144<rating>81<whiskey>Chichibu The First distilled 2008 (bottled 2011), 61.8%<review>Ichiro Akuto, whose family previously owned the now demolished Hanyu distillery, and have five centuries of experience in sake production, opened his boutique distillery outside the town of Chichibu just over three years ago. This is the first official release of whisky (rather than new make) and it’s delicious. Lightly scented with touches of lemongrass, fennel pollen, sweet pear, and cookie dough, it has lovely balance and weight. Water allows it to spread over the tongue. One to watch. £90"
4142,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Fukano 2017 Edition, 42.8%<review>Japanese rice whiskies enjoy a cult following for their delicate flavors. This Fukano stands out with its ethereal fruity delights, the result of meticulous vigilance to preserve the spirit’s subtle nature. It brings a supple nose of lychee, ripe peaches, Smarties, watermelon, allspice, and white pepper. A light, slightly syrupy texture is underscored by watermelon and raspberry as it unwraps peach, nectarines, rhubarb, and custard candy, fruit Life Savers, stewed fruits, red berries, and light citrus.

4143,"<price>119<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie Ealanta Private Edition, 46%<review>Ealanta is the fourth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series, and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from Missouri for nineteen years. The result is a nose of American cream soda, milk chocolate, fudge, pineapple, and honey; spicy and creamy. Silky smooth in the mouth, with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal, with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. Long in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, aniseed, and an enduring spicy creaminess."
4144,"<price>145<rating>87<whiskey>Auchentoshan Silveroak 1990, 50.9%<review>This is the second batch of Silveroak 1990 from Auchentoshan, and it has benefited from an extra year of maturation in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. The 22 year old is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets. Notably floral on the nose, with fudge, banana, ginger, and attractive oak. On the palate it delivers vanilla, apricots, apples, more ginger, and oak. The finish is long and spicy, with dark coffee notes and a hint of menthol. Greater complexity than its predecessor."
4145,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Rye (2015 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 64.96%<review>Distilled in 2008, this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection. The boldest and spiciest too! A blast of mint, clove, and cinnamon leads the spice charge, with fig, dates, caramel-coated nuts, vanilla, and candied fruit. Well-integrated flavors, and a smart balance of youth and maturity."
4146,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Rye, 63.45%<review>One of the best Handy offerings yet. Very vibrant with dynamic spice (firm mint, warming cinnamon, allspice, hint of clove) and lush fruit (citrus, orchard fruit, golden raisin, brandy, and teasing coconut), all tamed by a bed of soothing caramel and honey. It’s not easy for a whiskey to come across as excitingly youthful, yet nicely matured. It’s a difficult balance to achieve, but this whiskey pulls it off. Editor's Choice"
4147,"<price>46<rating>76<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Organic 6 Grain Whiskey, 45%<review>Youth and rawness offer the first impression, with fresh-cut oak and grains leading the way. The raw grains develop into cooked-oat notes followed by rye toast, tobacco, oak, smoke, and an unwanted bitterness that lingers. The short finish offers a hint of caramel and citrus. Price is per 375 ml."
4148,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Bunnahabhain Ceobanach, 46.3%<review>This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement, none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46"
4149,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Clynelish, 14 year old, 46%<review>It’s good to see an official distillery bottling of Clynelish in the U.S. This one is very true to the Clynelish style: fresh, appetizing, and very drinkable. Notes of brine, fruit (lemon-lime), and vanilla-accented malt, are the foundation of this whisky. Delicate seaweed, peat, exotic pepper and a hint of citrus rind bitterness entertain the palate throughout, all the way to its appetizingly briny, seaweed-tinged finish. Perhaps the definitive aperitif whisky. 
"
4150,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Westland American Oak Single Malt, 46%<review>Floral and spice, including orange blossom and clove, this pours berry fruit on the palate before the chocolate malt balls set in. Seamless, nicely done, and certainly moreish, as the clean, drying finish gives way to biscuit, brioche, and pain au chocolat."
4151,"<price>115<rating>85<whiskey>Glen Garioch Single Cask #990 1998, 56.1%<review>A 15 year malt selected by the Loch & K(e)y Society. Hard apple cider leads the nose and is backed by honeyed malt and cinnamon-baked pear. The entry is lush caramel apple, but quickly transitions as the sheer power and spice of the mid-palate comes crashing in with oak, ginger, and pine. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with lingering heat. This is the kind of big, bold, dry whisky that American whiskey drinkers might enjoy. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
4152,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>House of Hazelwood 18 year old, 40%<review>The style and class of the youngest was inspired by the classic elegance of Paris in the 1920s. Comprising Kininvie and Girvan married in tuns of Portuguese oak, this is pure, creamy goodness bathing in lemon meringue pie, vanilla tablet, and fresh oak shavings. A buttery-soft texture, the back of the palate kicks off with honey explosions, nougat, and toffee, backed with a distinct oakiness to remind you that it’s got much more to offer than just vanilla playfulness. £50 Travel Retail exclusive"
4153,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Corsair Hopmonster, 46%<review>Well-named: hops aroma comes flying right out of the glass — green pine and light peppermint — along with hot, sweet booze, but it’s a very clean scent, not feinty or heavy. The whiskey itself is quite light, not overbearing, and sweet with more pine and mint, along with a very pure malt character and a light touch of oaky vanilla. This is IPA booze, a rain-pure version, and more barrel could ruin it. Great gateway whiskey for a beer geek."
4154,"<price>815<rating>92<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2017 Edition, 46.8%<review>Closer to the heart of JW than its predecessors, Mastery of Oak follows a methodically complicated maturation and blending regime. American oak characteristics, singed cedar spills, damson jam, stewed apple, and rhubarb laced with peppery spice, nutmeg, and clove. A dichotomy of flavors: toffee apple and rhubarb become piquant, verging on sour, with a parallel strand of honey and Caramac. Short finish of the last vestiges of fruit and spice. (5,588 bottles, U.S. Travel Retail)"
4155,"<price>140<rating>80<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Dailuaine) 1996, 57.5%<review>Like being stuck inside the Dailuaine dark grains plant: all Marmite (yeast extract spread), deglazed roasting pan, and a cereal note. In other words, the distillery character is the major contributor. Some light nuttiness, but overall this is Dailuaine in funky guise. Becomes more, errr…agricultural with water. Robust and peppery on the tongue. A nice example, albeit without massive complexity."
4156,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>Wiser’s Small Batch, 43.4%<review>With Small Batch, Wiser’s offers a taste of the quality of its more expensive Legacy to those with a limited whisky budget. This is big whisky at a very affordable price. Cinnamon, cloves, and candied ginger temper glowing hot pepper, while oak caramels and vanilla bolster sweet dark fruit. The earthiness of rye intersects with the fragrance of river plants and wet slate. Red cedar and fresh sawdust round out a clean, expressive palate. Lots of weight. C$33"
4157,"<price>6542<rating>87<whiskey>The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1978 37 year old (Cask #2708), 50.2%<review>After the 68’s quiet nature, we reach Balvenie in fully mature, robust character—well, as robust as Balvenie ever gets. That means more cask-derived notes of vanilla ice, butterscotch, crème brûlée, and a jag of citrus bringing you to your senses. There’s squidgy caramel toffee and the honey is now fixed in the comb adding that distinct waxiness of old, gently matured whisky. The biggest and sweetest of the series. Excellent."
4158,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Grand Macnish 12 year old, 40%<review>With a bottle shape that makes you want to go bowling, this blend has admirable balance between the fruit and the smoke on the nose. The bonfire smoke is matched with aromas of tarte tartin, pecan nut, red apple, and sultana. Smooth and molten in the mouth, it has more weight and body than its older brother. There is citrus, apples, and the late arrival of baked spices, cookie dough, and mint chocolate on the finish."
4159,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>Four Roses Small Batch Bourbon, 45%<review>A soft, delicate bourbon -- especially when compared to its single barrel siblings here. Subtle notes of candied fruit and creamy sweet notes (vanilla, coconut, light toffee, and caramel corn) are nicely interwoven. Some integrated, gently-dried spice dances throughout and lingers on the finish. An easy-to-embrace bourbon with nice balance."
4160,"<price>99<rating>89<whiskey>Glenmorangie Spìos, 46%<review>The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop. Initially fruity on the palate, with ripe banana, then slightly earthy, with nutty spice and cocoa powder. Zesty spices in the finish, drinking chocolate, and youthful oak."
4161,"<price>90<rating>80<whiskey>Inchmurrin Madeira Wood Finish, 46%<review>Surprisingly the most reticent nose of the three Inchmurrins. Mild orchard fruit, apple blossom, cocoa powder, and a hint of nutmeg. Initially, red grapes and almonds on the palate, with the fruit then darkening to raisins and developing oak. The finish is long, spicy, dry, and oaky, with persistent background fruitiness trying to break through."
4162,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Girvan Patent Still Proof Strength, 57.1%<review>Apples squeezed in a cider press, sherbet Dib Dabs, and cinnamon sticks comprise the nose of this west coast grain whisky. It’s lip-tingling at cask strength; the lemon and molten honey tussling with the effervescence of the Dib Dabs before golden syrup pours over the tongue. It’s like crunching through a packet of powdery Love Hearts erupting in the mouth. Water encourages peach fondant French fancies flavors, with a slightly pushy fruit skin note at the finish. £75"
4163,"<price>32<rating>88<whiskey>Black Ridge, 45%<review>Rich aroma of vanilla and corn, crimped and spiced with oak. Authoritative strength, full and solid; sharp oak and dry mint, with vanilla and cornbread arriving toward the finish, which is the only jarring note. There's too much woody bite at the close. Still, very much a sipping whiskey; don't put anything but a bit of water or a single cube of ice in this. By far, the best of the Total Wine store brands I've received. Sourced whiskey. 
"
4164,"<price>22<rating>90<whiskey>Dewar’s 8 year old Caribbean Smooth Rum Cask-Finished, 40%<review>A delicious dram with a sunny disposition, this drums out aromas of butter biscuits, raisins, vanilla sugar, cane honey, and abundant tropical fruit notes of guava and papaya. It’s a light and nimble blend that weaves through white chocolate, biscuit notes, chewy granola bar, apricot, and mandarin. Spices rattle around a fruit core on the finish. Rum powerhouse Bacardi acquired Dewar’s in 1998; they should have done this years ago. Best Values"
4165,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, 13 year old, 1993 Vintage, 48%<review>The same vintage as last year’s Birthday Bourbon but aged one year longer. Last year’s version was quite intense with a lot of wood influence. What does one more year in wood do to the whisky? Surprisingly, the oak spice seems less dominant, and the flavors are more balanced. Still, this is still a serious bourbon drinker’s bourbon. Piquant, dried spice notes of vanilla, cocoa, mint, and cinnamon are tamed by layers of maple syrup, caramel, and toffee. Every once in a while some fruits try to get recognized. A powerful, after dinner bourbon. 
"
4166,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength (Batch B), 57.2%<review>A bold and expressive single pot still with a nose of fudge, vanilla, plummy sherry notes, bramble, aromatic spices, and dried orange peel. Sweet sherry, nutty, with a slow build-up of spice to a concentrated peak of clove and peppercorns; then there’s red apple, caramel, and vanilla as the spices keep going into the dry finish. This one has a lot to say. (252 bottles)"
4167,"<price>40<rating>94<whiskey>Knob Creek Single Barrel, 9 year old, 60%<review>This new single barrel expression of Knob Creek tastes very similar to the original “small batch” Knob Creek (when brought down to the same alcohol level). If anything, it’s slightly drier, more elegant, not as heavy on the palate, and more sophisticated — but I am reaching here. The similarity is a good thing, because I really enjoy the original expression. Keeping in mind that no two barrels are exactly alike, your decision to purchase the single barrel might just come down to whether you want to pay a little more for a higher strength version, and whether knowing that it might taste a little different than the standard small batch bottling excites you. This is a stylish, big, broad-shouldered bourbon with a thick, sweet foundation (nutty toffee, pot still rum, maple syrup) peppered with spice (cinnamon, but also vanilla and evergreen) and dried fruit. Dry, warming, resinous finish. (Incidentally, I would rate the small batch within a point or two, and the tasting notes would be very similar.)"
4168,"<price>113<rating>91<whiskey>Cragganmore 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 58.4%<review>Matured in refill American oak casks that previously held peated whisky, this 2006 distillate presents a nose of cider, heather, ginger, malt, hints of nutmeg, and peat. Ripe red apples on the palate, with honey, vanilla fudge, and a faint background wisp of smoke. Relatively long in the finish, with that light smoke persisting alongside black pepper, oak, and now unripe apples. £85"
4169,"<price>1230<rating>90<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection: Glenlivet Decades 1963, 40.6%<review>A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750"
4170,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1999 Vintage (Barrel #1), 43.3%<review>This might the most drinkable Evan Williams Single Barrel vintage ever produced. Its most noticeable personality trait is sweetness (gentle, not cloying), with notes of caramel corn, vanilla custard, candied fruit, and subtle macaroon. Spearmint, cinnamon, nutmeg, and charcoal provide some zest. Soft and clean on the finish, with gentle oak resin. A smooth, easy ride from beginning to end."
4171,"<price>35<rating>82<whiskey>Dunkel, 45%<review>Label says “Dunkel,” release says “Dunkelweizen,” two very different beers. Mostly strong sawn oak on the nose, with some clove (so maybe Dunkelweizen is closer). Springy, spicy, and a bit oily on the tongue; German gingerbread on the finish. (375 ml.)"
4172,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 9 year old Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Spring 2020 Edition), 50%<review>Grain takes pride of place here, with kettle corn, honey peanuts, and corn muffin on the nose, as well as milk chocolate, licorice root, blueberry jam, cinnamon, allspice, and brown sugar. More sweet grain and nuts on the palate, along with blueberry, fresh ginger, cinnamon, and a hint of mint. Add some water to lift the veil on the more subtle flavors. The rounded finish continues with nutty sweetness, milk chocolate, and well-integrated oak. Excellent balance."
4173,"<price>180<rating>88<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Lagavulin) 1979, 46%<review>Straw gold color. Peat smoke, damp earth, seaweed, balanced by a maple syrup sweetness on the nose and palate. Full-bodied and firm in body. Flavors are pleasantly mature and nicely integrated."
4174,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>1792 Port Finish Bourbon, 44.45%<review>The port finish is very evident but not overpowering. A fruit basket on the palate, with caramel apple, currants (red and black), bramble, apricot, toasted coconut, vanilla wafer, and anise. Rich and velvety in texture, with a long, gently sweet finish."
4175,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Penderyn Madeira Finish Single Malt, 46%<review>This nugget of Welsh gold has a nose of candied orange and lemon slices, toasted spices, herb garden, light vanilla, and the oils of finely shredded peel. On the palate, there’s toffee and orange cake, an array of tropical fruits with papaya and passion fruit sweetness, and a good thrust of pepper and clove, leaving just a hint of grated chocolate and cask char in a dry finish."
4176,"<price>130<rating>92<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection 2017 11 year old, 66%<review>A wonderful beginning of floral, fruit, leather, and oak notes; the start to a truly sensational whiskey. Its round caramel meets florals, stone fruit, honeysuckle, and dried apricot, with hints of dark chocolate, pear, and raw almonds not far behind. But this whiskey is about the spice, from pepper to baking spices; they wander the palate and walk you down a long and lovely finish with a hint of cinnamon apple."
4177,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Miyagikyo Single Malt, 45%<review>One for no age statement naysayers. An eloquent expression of sweet osmanthus, baked lemon, yuzu, violin resin, rich malts, and bonfire aromas on a favorite woolen jumper. It glides across the tongue with sweet barley sugar, but attests to greater depths; grapefruit, spicy ginger, and mandarin developing milk chocolate-coated, candied lemon flavors. A firm finish: green cardamom spices slowly releasing their grip on the front of the palate, leaving clingy vanilla. Unbound by an age statement, it’s a beautiful offering."
4178,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Benromach 10 year old, 43%<review>The first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners. I love the interplay here between the malt, sherry, and smoke, with all getting a chance to shine. A rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation, deep caramel, rhum agricole, an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate, along with grassy/hay notes, honeysuckle, subtle spice (cinnamon, anise), and lingering earthy smoke. A vast improvement from the “Origins” release last year. I would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak, bottling at 46%, and not chill-filtering it. Still, this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. Well done!"
4179,"<price>65<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%<review>This new recipe Monster brings aromas of waxed lemon and firm peat smoke layered with charcoal, iodine, Band-Aids, custard creams, and blowtorched peaks of lemon meringue pie. Vanilla, fudge, and white chocolate on the palate quickly succumb to a dustbowl of aromatic peat smoke bristling with spices. Lemon bonbons and honeydew leave hints of cocoa to finish. This type of monster you do want to find under your bed. "
4180,"<price>400<rating>90<whiskey>Balvenie Tun 1509 (Batch 6), 50.4%<review>The sixth batch in this highly regarded series comprises whisky aged in five refill sherry butts, seven DoubleWood refill sherry butts, and nine bourbon barrels. The nose is soft and inviting, with honey, pineapple, vanilla, caramel, and ginger. The palate is rounded, rich, and sweet, with honey, vanilla, apples, and pears. Tangy citrus fruit, star anise, and oak in the lengthy finish."
4181,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 023), 53.89%<review>This is heaped with toasty oak, notes of wood shavings, and nutty-sweet butter pecan ice cream. There’s a touch of herbal antiseptic and tarragon, but it’s kept in check, letting the caramel sweetness and baked marshmallow permeate the palate. Water unleashes dark cherry and candied peanuts. A really well-balanced whiskey, with sweetness, spice, and fruit working in harmony."
4182,"<price>150<rating>84<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Rosebank) 1992, 10 year old, 46%<review>Pale gold color. Aromatic, floral, herbal aromas (a veritable potpourri), with soft background vanilla malt notes and a hint of lemon. Light and soft in body. Soft, malty vanilla notes on the palate with interwoven notes of herbs, subtle dried fruit, and delicate wood resins. Gently dry finish. 
"
4183,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Wild Scotsman (distilled at Ben Nevis), 13 year old, 1992 vintage, cask #693<review>Very robust and chewy-this whisky has plenty of gusto-with notes of toffee, vanilla cream, bitter chocolate, powdered cocoa, and almond fig cake. Background citrus (especially on the nose), tobacco, and polished leather. Nice depth for such a young whisky, and very exciting. 
"
4184,"<price>180<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan 1861 Replica, 42.7%<review>Antique amber color. Aromas of toffee and malt, with interwoven dried fruit, flowers, and spices-a real potpourri. Rich, lush body. Rich flavors of toffee, wood resin spices, and citrus, finishing with notes of malt, toffee, and a hint of leather and smoke."
4185,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey>Tomintoul 12 year old Kedem Port Cask-Finished, 40%<review>The latest addition to the Tomintoul range, this is exclusive to the U.S., and is finished in port-style wine casks from Kedem Winery in New York. Sweet on the nose, with slightly spicy red wine notes, followed by strawberries and cream. The palate is smooth and creamy, with red cherries, cinnamon, and dark chocolate. Spicy in the finish, with ginger cookies and cherry brandy-filled liqueur chocolates. (12,000 bottles)"
4186,"<price>160<rating>88<whiskey>Black Bull 21 year old, 50%<review>Thick orange peels, grapefruit, lime zest, and Starburst taffy candies keep the nose of this premium expression within the purview of the Black Bull character. Layers of vanilla custard, mellow fruit, and ginger snaps quench an initial rush of sharp citrus. Sponge cake creaminess abounds though the spices nibble at the edges, leaving a long, sweet, citrus finish. Water nips the more acidic elements while leaving the citrus flavors intact."
4187,"<price>1000<rating>93<whiskey>Kentucky Owl Dry State, 50%<review>
A blend of straight bourbons 12 to 17 years old created by Kentucky Owl co-founder Dixon Dedman for the 100th anniversary of Prohibition. The nose is fragrant and gentle, with confectioners’ sugar, vanilla custard, nougat, marzipan, strawberry jam, leather, and light spice. Caramel and raisin bread coat the palate, accented by cinnamon, toasted almond, chocolate, chicory, and savory spice. A lengthy finish of chocolate and espresso, ending with a burst of spice."
4188,"<price>22<rating>84<whiskey>Sir Edward’s 12 year old Blended Whisky, 40%<review>A very different whisky to its unaged namesake, and most unlike any of the other blends tasted for this issue. That’s no bad thing.
This is less sweet than most blends, with tobacco leaf and ashtray to the fore, and a dusty, grainy note with a touch of oak, grape skin, and sweet heather. That said, not a lot of evidence of the 12 years in cask."
4189,"<price>120<rating>86<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular Range (distilled at Auchroisk) 18 year old, 48.8%<review>Here is Auchroisk at its more lifted and clean. A whiff of cooking lentils (a lovely smell) alongside lime and cottage cheese (again nice), it gives the impression of a healthy salad. The palate is sweet and quite buttery, with minimal attention from oak; instead it’s all very spring-like, with good mid-palate sweetness. Water dries it slightly, but also extends the palate. Quite lovely."
4190,"<price>177<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Grant Five Decades, 46%<review>Created by Dennis Malcolm to celebrate his half century at Glen Grant, this uses casks
from each of his five decades. Pale it may be, but this is no dainty little
thing. There’s lots of buttery oak before classic Glen Grant lift and energy
emerge: green apple, fruit blossom, William pear, and yellow fruits; lemon
butter icing and nettles with water. The palate is vibrant and energetic, but
holds to the middle of the tongue. A suitably celebratory dram.
Congratulations! £115"
4191,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Tomatin Oloroso Sherry 1995, 46%<review>This rested in bourbon barrels for almost 18 years until May 2013 when it was transferred to oloroso sherry hogsheads for a prolonged period of finishing. Big, waxy, warm leather notes on the nose, then dried fruit and machine oil. The palate is smooth, with cinnamon, cloves, sherry-soaked raisins, and dates. Spicy leather, plain chocolate, and slightly tannic oak in the very lengthy finish (1,800 bottles) £100"
4192,"<price>30<rating>82<whiskey>Lombard Speyside, 8 year old, 43%<review>Quite fragrant and fairly sweet (but not cloyingly so), rich with nutty toffee, nougat, and bright summer fruits. Clean, gently sweet finish. Well rounded, nicely matured for its age and, at $30, a good value these days. A versatile whisky to keep in the drinks cabinet; it’s enjoyable enough sipping neat or with a splash of water, but (at this price) you won’t cringe if your guests drink it on the rocks or use it as a mixer. "
4193,"<price>233<rating>88<whiskey>New Zealand<review>Rugby union fans will recognize the name and spot that 1987 was the last time the New Zealand All Blacks won the world cup. Bottled for this year's tournament, it's 24 year old whisky from the demolished Wilson distillery in Dunedin, and it's a rarity — very good New Zealand malt. It's not unlike the Shackleton — big lemon and smoke notes, a pear and apricot heart, lots of oaky spice, and a delicious aniseed rancio conclusion. $NZ 299"
4194,"<price>31<rating>86<whiskey>J.P. Wiser's Triple Barrel, 40%<review>Drinkers with a refined palate will enjoy the breadth and complexity of this whisky, the session drinker, its velvety smoothness. Barrel notes, from toasted vanilla to caramelized sugar and spicy cloves, give way to pickle-sour rye and bitter citrus pith. Searing peppers and ginger keep it exciting as dark fruits and black cherries fade to lime pith and peel. A long, glowing finish. (Australia only) $43 AUD"
4195,"<price>59<rating>93<whiskey>High Coast Dálvve Sherry Influence, 48%<review>This punchy U.S. debut is a smokier affair than their recent output, with aromas of campfire embers, cigar smoke, vanilla custard, bread-and-butter pudding, and cooked red gooseberry; this is calming, aromatic smoke associated with good times. Sipping reveals flavors of fresh raspberry, cinnamon, nutmeg, and chocolate, before a wave of smoke and caramel toffee. The tandem partnership of smoke and sherry is phenomenally good."
4196,"<price>75<rating>80<whiskey>Springbank 1997 vintage 10 year old (Cask #97/613), 58.2%<review>Aged in a re-charred sherry butt. Sweet, but not cloying, with plenty of fruit throughout. Toffee, vanilla fudge, roasted chestnuts, and nougat, enhanced by glazed peaches, burnt pineapple, dark cherry pits, and subtle anise. Gripping charred oak tannins emerge mid-palate and continue on the finish detracting from an otherwise very pleasant experience. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)"
4197,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>Easy Rider 4 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 40%<review>A simple and enjoyable whiskey with pleasant sweetness and fresh oak sawdust on the somewhat tight nose. While light-bodied on the palate, there is a nice oiliness to the texture, as flavors of toasted marshmallow, fresh citrus, and gentle cedar give way to a finish with some clove spice. (39,756 bottles)"
4198,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Gooderham & Worts Little Trinity 17 year old, 45%<review>The standard Gooderham & Worts blends corn, wheat, barley, and rye whiskies. This special edition forgoes the barley but not the flavor. A lovely hard toffee start slides into a wealth of cereal notes: barley sugars, Cream of Wheat, and oatmeal. Lovely soft caramels send a smooth sweetness gliding over the palate. Little Trinity exemplifies luxurious mouthfeel as much as it does breadth of flavor."
4199,"<price>77<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Grant 15 year old Batch Strength, 50%<review>Described by its distillers as “the most intensified expression” of Glen Grant, this was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is fresh and floral, with rose petals, Turkish delight, and cinnamon. Supple on the palate, clean and fruity, with developing soft toffee, pear drops, ginger, and a floral carryover from the nose. The finish is medium in length, with slightly astringent oak."
4200,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>New York Honey Whiskey, 40%<review>Finger Lakes Distilling rye whiskey infused with Catskill Mountains honey. The nose is grassy, oily rye whiskey, and the honey’s there mostly as a rounder, richer character enhancer. It’s much more present in the mouth, merging very nicely indeed with the rye. There’s authentic, delicious honey flavor here, and it’s balanced beautifully as the rye keeps it from being sticky or oversweet. An excellent and interesting flavored whiskey; up there with the best examples of the category."
4201,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Tipperary Boutique Knockmealdowns 10 year old, 47%<review>Cinnamon, dusty cocoa, rich toffee, and sultana on the nose. The mouthfeel is leaner, with more cocoa and savory ham notes, sweet popcorn, cinnamon, and thin slivers of chocolate, all shot through with sweet stewed fruits. Water brings out a soft chocolate brownie before a lengthy finish."
4202,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Widow Jane 10 year old Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch #137), 45.5%<review>Floral on the nose, with notes of orange blossom, as well as cinnamon, caramel, coffee cake, and cola. The palate is smooth and balanced, featuring pound cake, chocolate frosting, pepper, Almond Joy, and lemon iced tea. The finish has excellent length, and reprises the tropical notes. Water brings out vanilla custard and cinnamon. Light, complex, and balanced, with great integration of flavors; perfect for the warmer months."
4203,"<price>25899<rating>92<whiskey>Lagavulin Prima & Ultima 28 year old 1991, 50.1%<review>Sweet peat smoke and heather on the nose, with light ginger and smoked fish drizzled
with lemon. Oily and rounded on the palate, with more sweet peat, lemon, and sea
salt. Very long in the slightly waxy finish, with peat and licorice. Price is for entire
Prima & Ultima Collection, of which this whisky is a part. (1,013 bottles) £20,000"
4204,"<price>28<rating>89<whiskey>The Sexton, 40%<review>One of the most striking-looking new releases around, this bone-jangling, sepulchral, triple-distilled whiskey was once entombed in oloroso sherry butts. A nose of baked apple and sultana, rolled marzipan, sesame seeds, and roasted spices. Smooth tasting, with dark fleshy fruits, mixed peel, chocolate, walnut; the taut spicy middle section dies back to baked oranges. A dignified finish, with chocolate and nutmeg at the death. Ingest in peace."
4205,"<price>55<rating>93<whiskey>Four Roses Small Batch Select Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 52%<review>The limited-edition releases from Four Roses are always top-notch, but this bourbon—a permanently available addition to the lineup—proves itself every bit the equal of its rarer brethren. Made with the distillery’s F yeast strain, among others, it has a perfumed nose, with orange blossom, cedar chest, berries, spearmint, tobacco leaves, sassafras, licorice, and layers of earthy spice. The palate is consistent and deep, with flavors of cherry Coke, cough syrup, orange oil, leathery dark fruit, black pepper, chili flakes, and chocolate, shifting into a minty finish replete with pepper, cinnamon, dark chocolate, cooked berries, and roasted walnuts. Full, rich, and utterly satisfying. Number 3 in the 2019 Top 20"
4206,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>Masterson’s Straight Rye Whiskey Batch #3 10 year old, 45%<review>The third recently released 100% rye whiskey sourced from Canada, with the others being WhistlePig (50%, $70) and Jefferson’s (47%, $40). (The one you purchase might depend on which one you can find, as they are all quite limited.) This one sells at a premium to the other two, but shows polish and is nicely rounded. Layers of sweetness (honeyed fruit, caramel, nutty toffee, maple syrup), toasted oak, cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg, and a dusting of cocoa. Very distinctive!"
4207,"<price>24<rating>79<whiskey>Islay Mist, 8 year old, 40%<review>The nice thing about Islay whiskies is that they often show their true nature better at a younger age. Malty sweet and incredibly herbal (almost gin-like), with emerging tar, smoked seaweed, and olive. Medicinal in nature, with lingering tar and brine on the finish. Fairly straight-forward (what do you expect for 8 years old?) but a pretty decent showing for a whisky this young."
4208,"<price>32<rating>90<whiskey>Knob Creek, 50%<review>Knob was one of the first bourbons I had when I started taking whiskey seriously, and it’s still a kicker. No-nonsense, flint-hard nose: slickly-polished oak furniture, cinnamon stick, cracked rye, wet cornmeal, hard candies. Bang! A lean whiskey that gets in your mouth and explodes with rye spice and cinnamon candy, a sharp wedge that opens you right up. The finish echoes: oak, a dying fire, clean and almost crisp. Emphatic, bright, and swift. Value Pick"
4209,"<price>103<rating>88<whiskey>The Macallan Sienna, 43%<review>When approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66"
4210,"<price>200<rating>84<whiskey>Pappy Van Winkle 23 year old Family Reserve, 47.8%<review>Broodingly thick and syrupy in texture, and quite dry-especially on the finish. Twenty-three years is a long time for bourbon to spend in oak, and this one shows its age. The flavors and complexity of its younger two siblings is evident until mid-palate, but then dwindles slightly as the whisky progresses, replaced by dry, spicy, leathery, sooty-charcoal, tobacco notes."
4211,"<price>47<rating>95<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, 1995 Vintage, “American Oak Chips Seasoned,” 45% <review>Surprisingly light and fresh for a 15 year old whiskey. Crisply spiced, with cinnamon, evergreen, vanilla, anise, and teaberry. Hints of dried fruit, kissed with light honey and a wisp of smoke. Balanced and clean throughout, and very drinkable. An excellent whiskey! Price is per 375ml."
4212,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Garioch 1991, 54.7%<review>Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.) "
4213,"<price>25<rating>83<whiskey>Cask & Crew Blended Rye (Batch 1), 40%<review>A blend of 51% 3 year old Canadian rye and 49% aged American corn whiskey. It has aromas of peanut shell, tea leaf, dill, mint, Popsicle stick, and bags of grain at the general store. The light-bodied palate is redolent of pencil shavings, chamomile, dried Turkish mint, and oaky spice, finishing very quickly."
4214,"<price>36<rating>90<whiskey>Glenlivet French Oak 12 year old, 40%<review>Antique amber color. This whisky maintains the elegance cherished by Glenlivet enthusiasts, but finishing the whisky in limousin oak produces a whisky of deeper wood notes, particularly wood spices (vanilla, sandalwood, perhaps even mint) and floral notes. It’s rich, complex, and dry-especially on the finish."
4215,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Hirsch The Horizon Straight Bourbon (Batch AHH0320), 46%<review>While the nose showcases primarily grain aromas, including cracked corn and peanut shell, it also has notes of white pepper, dark cherries, brown sugar, and Hershey’s chocolate syrup—a harbinger of things to come. The palate is a chocolate lover’s dream, rich and tantalizing without heaviness. There’s also mint, cinnamon, cashew butter, and well-integrated oak; time and water bring out sweet orange. It finishes with milk chocolate, toasted nuts, and lingering cinnamon."
4216,"<price>273<rating>93<whiskey>Ichiro’s Malt The Joker (distilled at Hanyu), 57.7%<review>The final deal of Ichiro Akuto’s Card Series, a vatting of Hanyu from 1985 to 2000. Highly complex, rich, and distinctly resinous. Typical Hanyu boldness, but with balance struck between weightiness, finesse, and intensity. There’s old cobbler’s shop, tack room, light smoke, incense, ink, autumn leaves, and sumac. The palate is sweet to start, then builds in power. Leathery, then praline, damson jam, and fine tannins. Water loosens the tension, allowing yuzu to show. What a way to go out. £220"
4217,"<price>24<rating>86<whiskey>Granndach 12 year old, 40%<review>Sherry cask influence makes itself known through cooked plums, chocolate, dried figs, raisins, hazelnuts, and sugared almonds on the nose. The palate is also sherry-forward and sweet, featuring dried and stewed fruit, hazelnut, almond, dark chocolate, and light gingerbread flavors. There’s a youthful heat, and the finish wraps up with bitter oak and a wisp of chocolate-covered raisin. Despite the low proof, a few drops of water help this hang together more evenly. (Walmart)"
4218,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg Blaaack (Committee Release), 50.7%<review>Ardbeg’s 2020 limited-edition cask-strength Committee Release was matured mainly
in pinot noir red wine casks from New Zealand, a country notable for its sheep, like
Islay. Woodsmoke on the nose, with coal fires, cedar, and canned fruit cocktail in a
mild antiseptic solution. Supple and sweet on the palate, with orchard fruits and an
emerging wave of peppery prickly peat smoke. Long in the sooty finish. Lively, with
chile paste."
4219,"<price>300<rating>87<whiskey>Chivas, 25 year old, 40%<review>Chivas's new entry into the premium blend category. A complex whisky (on the nose and palate) in the same vein as Chivas 18, only deeper, with more caramelized sweetness, darker fruit, and greater emphasis on dried spices and roasted nuts (and perhaps even tobacco). Everything moves along nicely -- and entertainingly -- until the whisky approaches the finish on the palate. Its age begins to show, as spicy oak dryness and suggestions of polished leather begin to dominate through to the finish. An enjoyable whisky, but I prefer the 18 year old to the 25 year old for its impeccable balance."
4220,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Coppersea Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye, 48%<review>A very grain-forward nose, reminiscent of caraway or a fresh pumpernickel loaf. A soft, dusty rye, with hints of peppermint, spearmint, and cinnamon candy and bitter brown sugar. Quite dry, with some bitter oak, dry hay, and fresh-sawn lumber. Dried herbs, grilled pineapple, and lingering pepper on the finish. Made from rye malted by hand and distilled in direct-fired stills, this whiskey is more focused on grain than oak. Empire rye"
4221,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Mackillop’s Choice (distilled at Mortlach), 1989 vintage, 21 year old, 46%<review>Certainly not the best Mortlach I’ve tasted, but it’s a solid effort and at a good price for a 21 year old. Nicely balanced — Lorne Mackillop’s hallmark — and somewhat reserved, too (for a Mortlach), with intriguing lime, kiwi, caramel, floral notes (on the nose), nutty toffee (especially on the palate), soaked barley, and charcoal, with a rather syrupy, mouth-clinging texture toward the finish. Worth a look."
4222,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Torfa, 50%<review>The first peated expression from Glnglassaugh after reopening in 2008, Torfa is made from barley malted to 20 ppm and matured in bourbon barrels. Bonfire smoke, ozone, orchard fruits, malt, and black pepper are present on the nose. Slightly savory on the smooth palate, with sweet peat smoke, honey, dark chocolate, and a very mild maritime note. Ginger, apricot, and more sweet peat in the finish."
4223,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Method & Madness Virgin Spanish Oak-Finished, 46%<review>
Finely nuanced grain whiskey showing the light sweetness of honey on toast and golden syrup, with wood spices, peanut, and oak shavings. Rich mouthfeel with an enduring intensity of flavors of glazed fruits, vanilla, and citrus peel oils, with the new Spanish oak making a significant contribution through oak flavors, wood spices, crunchy oat cookies, and pecans in caramel. Those sweet toffee flavors will keep you coming back for more."
4224,"<price>38<rating>85<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Malted Rye, 43%<review>Sharp, even a bit of a sour edge, and some stemmy grass. Sweet and chewy grain in the mouth, with a nice touch of oily rye bitterness, some hot oak that quirks the tongue a bit, then a finish that melts into creaminess."
4225,"<price>12<rating>80<whiskey>Black Eagle, 40%<review>Quite pale, looks more like scotch. Nose is hot, sweet, a bit minty. Hot in the mouth, thin, sweet, with flashy mint and corn. Finish is fiery, and a tad bitter with wood, especially bitey high in the mouth. Young, rough, and without the raunchy fullness that can justify youthful braggadocio. There are better bourbons for only a dollar or two more. Sourced whiskey."
4226,"<price>850<rating>93<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2016 Edition, 43%<review>Here’s your private audience with the inestimable Mr. Beveridge. After contemplating impeccably selected aged liquids from the big five Distillers Company Limited (DCL) grain distilleries, he’s ready. Three vattings representing cask character, distillery character, and Highland single malt were combined in the final blend. Fresh layers of lemon and honey mingle with wood smoke. A seductive soft and creamy palate, saturated with fudge and delicate vanilla fuse together in a study of honeyed perfection. A fine indulgence. The best yet. (8,888 bottles)"
4227,"<price>206<rating>91<whiskey>Mars Komagatake Tsunuki Aging 2019, 56%<review>
Distilled at Mars Shinshu, but matured in the Mars Tsunuki aging cellar, this charms with fresh fruity notes of raspberry, apple, and pear, with banana loaf, baking spices, lemon zest, and seasoned oak. The opening flavors of vanilla fudge and warm fruits are submersed by a vigorous peppery incursion, though there’s pear, chocolate, malt, and vanilla pod flavors once that settles. I recommend experimenting to pinpoint your preferred dilution."
4228,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Tyrconnell 16 year old, 46%<review>Most Irish whiskey consumed in the U.S. is blended, and Ireland’s single pot still whiskeys enjoy a cult following. However, Irish single malts, including Tyrconnell 16 year old, are often unfairly overshadowed by their Scottish neighbors. This limited-edition whiskey, made entirely with Irish barley, is double distilled in pot stills like most scotch, then aged in bourbon barrels. Tyrconnell is named for a racehorse, but this whiskey is slow and steady: it’s soft and gentle, yet full-flavored, with warming vanilla, graham cracker, and citrus notes, and rounded spice. Though it may not be as brash as some scotch malts, this thoroughbred is able to go the distance. Number 16 in the 2017 Top 20 "
4229,"<price>900<rating>90<whiskey>GlenDronach Kingsman Edition 1991, 48.2%<review>A nose of bold sherry, worn leather, figs, malt, white pepper, and ginger. Ultimately, a mildly savory note. Full-bodied on the palate, with overripe damsons and more ginger; spicy sherry and dried fruits develop. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent prickly spices, black coffee, and fragrant oak. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
4230,"<price>35<rating>85<whiskey>Big Bottom Bourbon (finished in Zinfandel casks), 45.5%<review>Sourced whiskey, selected then finished by Big Bottom in Zin casks at their Oregon warehouse. Ruby glint to the whiskey, and a big, sweet, hot nose with a wine-side fruity slant to it. Wine’s more apparent
on the palate; there’s a bit of oak bite and red wine tang heating up the bourbon, which is broad, without obvious corn. The corn appears in the finish, which is firm and gripping. The Zinfandel finish is well-played here."
4231,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Bruichladdich) 1986, 15 year old, 46%<review>Bright gold color. Fresh, appetizing aroma of vanilla malt, honey, brine, and subtle tropical fruit. Light to medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Delicious, fresh, subtly complex flavors of vanilla malt, sea salt, subtle tropical fruit, and fresh herbs, finishing dry and lightly spicy. Since the owners of Murray McDavid also control the Bruichladdich distillery, one would expect a good bottling. This is a good one indeed, and very exciting to drink. It is nicely matured, fresh, and deliciously appetizing-almost mouth-watering."
4232,"<price>17<rating>82<whiskey>Label 5 Classic Black, 40%<review>This is the foundation stone of the whole Label 5 range and it’s a solid, reputable blend that works neat, with a rock of ice, or in cocktails. The digestive biscuits, dark walnut toffee, and fruit salad aromas concede to a rather inauspicious palate of burnt orange, malt biscuits, charred oak, and ground ginger. It’s lively through to its malt and spice conclusion."
4233,"<price>82<rating>90<whiskey>Glen Scotia Victoriana, 51.5%<review>This was matured in a combination of first-fill and refill bourbon casks before 70% was finished in deeply charred casks and 30% in first-fill Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Char is apparent on the nose, along with pineapple, wood polish, blackcurrants, and a sprinkling of sea salt. Oily on the palate, with dark berry fruits, sherry, crème brûlée, and oak. The finish is spicy, with charred maritime oak."
4234,"<price>1000<rating>85<whiskey>Bowmore 37 year old 1968 vintage, 43.4%<review>Every once in a while you get whisky where the palate is completely different than the nose. This is one of those whiskies. Aged in bourbon casks and 37 years old, its aroma expresses tropical fruits (similar to other older Bowmores), with papaya, lemon, mango, strawberry, coconut, and banana. This is balanced by vanilla, crème brûlée, honey, and just a wisp of smoke. Bowmore’s Islay roots are more expressive on the palate, which starts off sweet and slightly oily, quickly evolving to tropical fruit, damp oak, and then leafy smoke through to the finish. The sweetness emerges again towards the finish, with subtle brine and seaweed. (120 bottles for the U.S.) 
"
4235,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Mackillop's Choice 14 year old 1989 vintage (distilled at Macallan), 58.2%<review>This expression is atypical for a Macallan whisky-the standard Macallan line is aged in sherry casks, while this one is aged in a bourbon cask. Absent the sherry, this isn’t as sweet or rich. Rather, it’s more delicate and gentle. The whisky is very clean and creamy, with lovely floral notes (lavender, heather, rose), intertwined with spices (especially vanilla), and fruit (baked apple, pineapple, coconut). Delicate, pleasing finish. One of the better non-sherried whiskies distilled at Macallan. (Bottled exclusively for retailer Wine on the 9.)"
4236,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Tomatin Decades, 46%<review>This bottling celebrates distillery manager Douglas Campbell’s 50 years of service at Tomatin, and includes casks from 1967, 1976, 1984, and 1990, along with a peated Tomatin from 2005. The nose is initially slightly musty, with faint peat smoke, sweetening to mild vanilla, with new leather and peaches in time. Full-bodied, relatively dry on the palate, with the European oak casks in the ascendancy here. Raisins, dark chocolate, and licorice. Medium to long in the finish, drying, with spicy oak. "
4237,"<price>56<rating>92<whiskey>New Riff Kentucky Straight Single Barrel Rye (No. 15-5356), 58.2%<review>This presents a pleasant nose of fresh-baked muffins, honey-dipped apples, powdered sugar, raisin bread, baking spice, and cooked black cherries. Big and spicy, but smooth on the palate, with flavors of dark fruit and bitter chocolate, grape jam, blackcurrants, herbs, cola, and dark berries. The finish offers richness and length, with vanilla notes, spice, and freshly baked apple pie. This is a big, solid whiskey, beautifully structured, and carries its proof superbly."
4238,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Ranger Creek .36, 48%<review>That’s “.36” as in ’36 caliber,’ the first of this Texas distiller’s Small Caliber Series of Texas bourbon whiskeys. Sharpish on the nose with some hot alcohol, cinnamon, and oak, warmed by burnt sugar and vanilla. A kick of hot oak spice on the tongue, a flush of hot, dry corn, and flashes of mint and vanilla, then a long, spicy finish with more dry mint. One of the better young bourbons — only 8 months — I’ve had. Price is per 375 ml."
4239,"<price>550<rating>89<whiskey>Auchentoshan 1979 Oloroso Sherry Matured, 50.5%<review>The latest release in Auchentoshan’s 1970s Vintage Series is this expression, distilled on October 22, 1979 and matured in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for 32 years. Just 1,000 bottles are available (12 bottles for the U.S.). Sweet on the nose, with furniture polish, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and a faint whiff of old leather. Big tropical fruit notes open the palate, soon turning to smoky blackcurrants, tea, and rich fruit loaf. The finish is spicy, featuring black pepper, tobacco, dark berries, and plain chocolate."
4240,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>Ballantine’s 17 year old Signature Distillery Editions – Scapa, 43%<review>As you raise the glass to your nose, this has refreshment written all over it. The fragrance of an early morning visit to a florist, zesty orange notes, honey, peach pits, a hint of salt, and the faintest trace of smoke. It’s silky smooth, glistening with honey, a firm edge of orange, vanilla tablet, barley sugar, powdered ginger, all elevated by the grains supporting the Scapa. A smooth, feather-light finish of sparkling light spices and creaminess. A joy to behold."
4241,"<price>69<rating>86<whiskey>Kinahan’s Single Malt 10 year old, 46%<review>200 years ago, Kinahan’s was the favorite tipple of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The small batch single malt has blackcurrant jellies, cinnamon sticks, dry oak spices, and baked raisins on the nose. An unctuous, succulent palate follows, with rich baked goods, roasted fruits, baked orange, cherry cola, black pepper, and chili flakes. Rounded, weighty, sweet, and rolling, this just laps up the water. Dark, oily finish with bitter chocolate. A single malt you can really get behind."
4242,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Century Reserve Lot 15/25, 40%<review>Sweet citrus fruits, floral overtones, and assertive peppery spices interlace a generous framework of silky oak tannins. Charred oak and pencil shavings hint at new oak, while the frosty crispness of dry autumn leaves confirms that at least some of this whisky has spent decades in reused barrels. Touches of almond skins and peach pits cleanse the late palate. Otherwise regal and elegant, this whisky is just a touch woody.  C$30 "
4243,"<price>180<rating>88<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Rimfrost, 53.2%<review>This is the whisky equivalent of Metallica playing country songs. You can feel the power of the malt, you know it can kick out hard if it wants to. But it's all wrapped up in Kentucky finery, the sweet bourbon candy and vanilla notes offsetting the salt and pepper, and some mint leaf and berry fruits to send it on its way. It's not an entirely comfortable pairing, but by far the best of this bunch. SEK 1195"
4244,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Highland Park Ambassador's Choice 10 year old, 46%<review>Originally exclusive to the Swedish market, this expression was selected by Highland Park’s Danish brand ambassador Martin Markvardsen. Matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% oloroso sherry casks. Waxy and malty on the early nose, with fresh earth, damp moss, vanilla, and honey. Gentle peat on the palate, more earthy notes; herbal, with lime and salt. The finish is quite short, showing apricots, slight peatiness, allspice."
4245,"<price>62<rating>87<whiskey>Douglas Laing Scallywag Cask Strength (batch 2), 54.1%<review>Rich marmalade, gingersnaps, dried tropical fruits, vanilla pods, and cinnamon bark abound on this limited edition, top dog whisky from Douglas Laing & Co, which includes Mortlach, Macallan, and Glenrothes. The satsuma peel acidity settles quickly to show off its tricks of green apple, spices, hazelnut, Maltesers, and ginger. Late development brings out plain chocolate squares, maltiness, and intense coffee notes. Water picks out chocolate orange truffles. Coffee cups and chocolate biscuits to finish. My tail is wagging for more. (4,800 bottles) £50"
4246,"<price>170<rating>87<whiskey>Heartwood Vat Out of Hell, 67.4%<review>You don’t want to argue with this, sport, or it’ll deck you. Look at the strength, for a starter. But this is Australian whisky going off into a whole new direction, and not taking prisoners on the way. It’s
Lark whisky mixed with another Tasmanian one so you get the big clove and nutmeg, apple core, and fermenting fruit notes, but with honey and peat in the mix. Love it, loathe it, but you can’t ignore it. A$190"
4247,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Old Potrero Single Malt Straight Rye, 48.5%<review>Made with 100% malted rye. A nose of candied orange, cherry, green banana, and melon, along with sultanas, prunes, berries, and nuts. The palate starts orangey and sweet, followed by licorice, espresso, bitter chocolate, cashew, molasses, burnt sugar, and spice. Water unveils roasted peanuts, marshmallow char, more chocolate, and coffee beans. The finish is balanced oak, charred almonds, more coffee beans, tropical melon, and orange. Pleasurably crunchy, with intriguing overlays of bitter chocolate, espresso, and nuttiness."
4248,"<price>135<rating>85<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Release 2015), 56.8%<review>As pale as you'd expect, this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes."
4249,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich The Organic 2010, 50%<review>Distilled exclusively with organic barley grown the previous year by Mid Coul Farms near Inverness, this 8 year old was aged in bourbon barrels. Barley, salted butter, peach, malt, and vanilla on the nose, plus cocoa powder. Quite piercing citrus fruits on the smooth palate, with more vanilla, fudge, overripe banana, and milk chocolate. Spicy oak and a suggestion of brine in the finish. (18,000 bottles)"
4250,"<price>120<rating>77<whiskey>Vintage Rye, 23 year old, 47%<review>Very mature and quite rich on the nose with thick toffee, molasses, maple syrup, suggestions of Pedro Ximinez sherry, deep sappy oak notes and background spices. Similar on palate entry, too-a mouthful of rich, chewy whiskey-but the whiskey then unfortunately turns very dry, with oak and leather notes that dominate. Save some $$ and get the more balanced 21 year old. 
"
4251,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Bushmills 16 year old, 40%<review>The most northerly of Northern Ireland’s distilleries, Bushmills ages this spirit in bourbon and oloroso casks before finishing in port wine casks. The sweet notes of fat, ripe blueberries, plum flesh, and dusty, dry warehouses sketch out the nose. It lands on the tongue dry but piquant, then the fruit swarms all over it; blueberry, black currant, and apple, with hazelnut, chocolate pralines, black pepper, and spice. This was once the pick of the range, but the port influence seems feistier than older bottlings and I miss how smooth this used to taste."
4252,"<price>46<rating>89<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label Islay Origin, 42%<review>The smoky black peat, toasted spice, lemon peel, toffee, swept autumn leaves, and dried fruits on the nose give this expression greater affinity to regular Black Label than the rest of the range. Lagavulin and Caol Ila, among other Islay single malts, are included in this blend. The palate begins with a smooth array of caramel, smoke, and spice, transitioning through darker toffee notes to thick treacle, toasted hazelnut, and peppercorn, with brief flashes of fruitiness on the finish."
4253,"<price>18<rating>83<whiskey>Red Stag Black Cherry, 40%<review>Smells like sweet, dead-ripe cherries, mashed up in bourbon with some brown sugar and just a dust of cinnamon. It's sweet, a bit thick, but 80 proof warming, and the bourbon — the Beam cinnamon note comes out clearer now — is dominant over the cherries here. The finish sees more cinnamon, even a hint of barrel oak, and manages to dry out a bit."
4254,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>M&H Elements Peated Single Malt, 46%<review>
The longer you leave this, the smokier it gets; earthy peat, heavy smoke, hints of bacon fat and steaming asphalt, with blossom honey, vanilla fudge, and lemonade. Dense flavors of honey, vanilla, caramel, sweet satsuma, Jelly Tots, and lime Fruit Pastilles, with mild ginger, pepper, and clove, as smoke builds in the throat. Molten caramel and lemon peel finish, scorched by peat smoke. A magnificent use of Islay casks."
4255,"<price>959<rating>95<whiskey>Carsebridge 48 year old, 43.2%<review>Sure, the oldest of this year’s Diageo Special Releases manifests the brown-and-orange world of 1970 incarnate, but it does so in glorious fashion. Golden and warm, dessert-like, with bread-and-butter pudding, spun sugar, plenty of oak character, lavender honey, golden puff pastry, perfumery scents, and the first fruits plucked from the orangerie. Quite simply the grooviest thing to come out of Alloa this year. (1,000 bottles)"
4256,"<price>150<rating>81<whiskey>Crown Royal XR, 40%<review>The newest offering from Crown Royal. Drier and more spice, with less of the creaminess of its siblings. I enjoy the subtle, dry complexity on the nose and the promise on the first part of the palate. But the whisky quickly turns quite dry on the latter part, with the oak playing the dominant role. XR contains older whiskies (including some from the old Waterloo distillery), so this is a rare whisky indeed, but it is difficult to improve on the profound effort of Crown Royal Special Reserve."
4257,"<price>65<rating>80<whiskey>Signatory 'Unchillfiltered' (distilled at Edradour), 10 year, 1992 Vintage, 46%<review>Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose. Chewy and syrupy on the palate, with layers of sweetness (toffee, caramel, fudge), roasted almonds, and raisins. A drying, resinous spice finish saves the sweetness from being too dominant. Call me sentimental, but I just remembered the old Campbell Distillers 10 year old bottling which expressed so much more finesse, and was cleaner and not as heavy and cluttered. 
"
4258,"<price>110<rating>92<whiskey>Jameson 18 year old, 40%<review>Unmistakably Jameson on the nose, this is a belter of a whiskey: honey, apple, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, and sublime pot still spiciness. This offers sweet toffee and caramel, bursting with spices, just a hint of sherry, Brazil nut, vanilla, creamy oak, and a caressing mouthfeel. A triumph that exemplifies the glories of pot still blending, and its sherry influence makes for a rich ending."
4259,"<price>101<rating>82<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Macallan) 21 year old, 51.5%<review>Full gold. A solid middle-weight Macallan with some putty/Play-Doh, and even after this length of time, a certain youthful airiness. This slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. When neat, the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes, cereal, oiled jackets. Water improves things, releasing an aroma akin to Chenin Blanc, then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69"
4260,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Ohishi Tokubetsu Reserve, 40.5%<review>This is a nuanced delicacy, so tread lightly. It offers a nose of rich apple, oloroso sherry, cranberry, pepper, fennel, star anise, and a touch of milk chocolate. The sherry casks are at play: dark ruby fruits, peppery spice, and cinnamon. The mouthfeel holds steady, with Cola Cubes, stewed blackberry, and apple peels as the spices fall out, ending with cocoa-dusted dried fruits. (1,479 bottles)"
4261,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Arran 14 Year Old, 46%<review>This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt."
4262,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>King of Kentucky 14 year old, 62.5%<review>Simply beautiful. It’s so complex, with notes of molasses, apple butter, toffee, salt water taffy, hazelnut, burnt brown sugar, crème brûlée, caramel flan, butterscotch, crystallized ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, fenugreek, roasted almonds, and marshmallow. With a drop of water, another complex layer forms with cotton candy and burnt pie crust. In both cases, it finishes extremely long."
4263,"<price>91<rating>80<whiskey>Stauning Young Rye June 2013, 51.2%<review>It's the sheer chutzpah of these young whisky producers that I adore. They don't care. They're skate punks crashing through the whisky suburbs, flipping cartwheels and turning the world upside down. This isn't great, truth be told, but what nerve to try making a rye! And while it's hard to tell with this most difficult of grains, I reckon this will come off. Hickory, licorice, and spice are in place. Now we need balance. Watch this space. 495 Krone/500 ml"
4264,"<price>92<rating>82<whiskey>Stalk and Barrel Cask 12, 63.2%<review>Still Waters distillery’s owners invited customers to select their next single cask release. Noting the soft cereal notes, stewed apples and raisins, and hot spices in an oily body, they recommended this one. A fruity nose with barrel tones and icing sugar blossoms in the glass while the hot, spicy palate shows hints of licorice, cloves, and vanilla. A good dash of water mollifies a drying tendency without dampening the flavor or creaminess. (Distillery only) C$100"
4265,"<price>125<rating>88<whiskey>Kilchoman Red Wine Cask Matured, 50%<review>Distilled in 2012, this was aged in casks sourced from the Douro Valley in Portugal. Quite reticent on the early nose, with developing strawberries, vanilla custard, new oak, and subtle smoke. The palate offers smoky red wine notes, with ashy peat, spices, and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. Sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices."
4266,"<price>110<rating>88<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2003 Vintage, 40%<review>Named for the distillery of the same name, and where many other well-know Irish blends are produced (including Jameson, Powers, Paddy, and Tullamore Dew). This is the distillery’s ultra-premium blend offering. The whiskey is somewhat shy and bashful in personality (when compared to its pure pot still siblings like Redbreast and the quite rare Jameson 15 year old) and really takes some patience to appreciate its subtle beauty. Sweet notes of honeyed malt and vanilla up front, with a hint of marshmallow and summer fruits. The palate eventually dries out nicely and deepens, evolving into a medley of subtle spice. Very drinkable. 
"
4267,"<price>35<rating>76<whiskey>MacNaMara Blended, 40%<review>This amber-colored blend from the Gaelic Whisky Company has sweet barley notes and gentle spice aromas. The caramels prop up the dominant flavor of cold-pressed orange oil squeezed from the peel. A crescendo of peppery spice marks the late phase and distinguishes the swallow, before a finish of tangy citrus peel with a touch of clove. Perfectly straightforward blend but limited in scope, like a linear dot-to-dot connecting barley, orange peel, and spice."
4268,"<price>130<rating>83<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 54.4%<review>Typically pale and slightly broader than in previous years, with a little more fleshiness that rubs alongside squid ink and white pepper. Huge smoke mingles with the sharp tang of brine and a touch of bran. Water brings out lanolin. There’s little oak getting in the way of the distillery character here and while water settles the waves, it just doesn’t have the extra dimension that elevates the decent to the great. It does make a great highball tho’. (31,428 bottles)"
4269,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfiddich 21 year old Gran Reserva Caribbean Rum Finish, 40%<review>Soothing and seamless on the nose and palate with chewy toffee, molasses, nougat, almond butter, vanilla fudge, cinnamon spice, and nutmeg, along with gentle tobacco notes emerging later on the palate. A pleasing dry finish offsets the sweeter notes. A delicious whisky from beginning to end."
4270,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>Springbank Green 12 year old, 46%<review>This bourbon-cask matured 12 year old was distilled using organic barley. 9,000 bottles released globally. Pears and pineapple in brine on the early nose. Peanut brittle, licorice, and subtle peat. Sweet and intensely fruity on the viscous palate, with developing nuttiness, vanilla, spice, and peat smoke. The finish is medium in length, with sweet fruit, more licorice, and sea salt."
4271,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Cathead Old Soul Blended Straight Bourbon (Batch 1), 45%<review>Cinnamon babka, powdered donuts, pecan-studded coffee cake: Call this breakfast whiskey. The nose is sweet, light, and nutty—a beignet with sugary chicory coffee. Sturdy and spiced on the palate, it has flavors of cinnamon, allspice, pepper, stone fruit, cherry pie, roasted pecans, and bracing oak, along with garden herbs. The finish is medium-length, with milk chocolate, black pepper, and roasted nuts."
4272,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>Compass Box The Circle (2019 Release), 46%<review>Rosey Mitchell, of Three Sheets cocktail bar in London and winner of the Compass Box bartender competition, collaborated on this whisky with Compass Box whisky maker Jill Boyd. Apple strudel, well-toasted malted bread, red apple, and hints of peat smoke: this pushes in lots of different directions. Light fudge, a well of active spices, orange, and peppercorn with smoked citrus peel on the dry finish. Convoluted and discombobulating. (6,151 bottles)"
4273,"<price>95<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Merchant’s Mahogany Chest (distilled at Glen Scotia) 1991, 46%<review>The latest single cask expression of 1991 Glen Scotia from Wemyss Malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt, which yielded 807 bottles. The nose provides sherry and cigar boxes, cherries, sultanas, raisins, orange peel, plum pudding, and finally warm leather. Full bodied, with sherry on the palate, plus brine, dried fruit, bitter coffee, and polished old, dark oak. Medium to long in the fruity finish, with salt, plain chocolate, and wood polish notes. £105"
4274,"<price>30<rating>83<whiskey>Chattanooga 1816 Reserve, 45%<review>Shy nose: some cornbread and spicy candy. Whooshes into the mouth, though, with a lively sweet and spicy rush followed by herbal notes: woodruff, fresh marjoram, meadow grass. The finish becomes drier, finally showing a bit of oak, then drying to a powdery, medicinal astringency. Almost more like a tonic than a whiskey. Sourced whiskey."
4275,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Ohishi Sherry Cask, 42.3%<review>This has the warming comfort of cask strength rice pudding, with just enough rice character peeking through the sherry. Marzipan, sultana, fig, and toasted spice. Nutty amontillado notes load up on dried fruits, including apricot, mango, and apples pricked with cloves. The late phase includes black cherry, old leather, cola-flavored candy, and burnt fruitcake. A quick fizzle of spice and dried fig turns slightly savory."
4276,"<price>190<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old (batch 5), 46.6%<review>Here’s one in the eye for people who grumble about high prices for age statement whisky. Sherry aromas, good-quality plain chocolate, clove-studded oranges, coffee beans, and fat sultanas. Thick, gloopy texture with lashings of sherry, mouth-drawing tannins, a pleasant buzz of wood spices, peppery chocolate, and coffee dregs. It emerges from a savory middle section to a burnt orange salvation, followed by a hot, oaky finish. £148"
4277,"<price>72<rating>89<whiskey>Talisker Dark Storm, 45.8%<review>Described as the smokiest whisky produced at Talisker, Dark Storm is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets, and maturation has taken place in deeply charred casks. Rich, fruity spices on the nose, quite citric, with brine and aromatic smoke. The smoke elbows its way to the fore in time. Full, sweet, fruity flavors on the palate, some vanilla, then smoke, licorice, and spice hit home. A classic Talisker smoke and chili finish, but cranked up a notch or two! £45/1 liter"
4278,"<price>260<rating>89<whiskey>Tomintoul 21 year old, 40%<review>Released in 2017 to replace the well-regarded 27 year old, this Tomintoul presents a nose of malt and gentle spice, with lemon drizzle cake. Medium-bodied on the palate, very sweet, with brittle toffee, honey, sultanas, wood spice, and black tea with sugar. Vanilla, licorice, allspice, and subtle oak in the finish."
4279,"<price>750<rating>93<whiskey>The Dalmore 1978, 46%<review>This 1978 vintage release from The Dalmore has been ‘finished’ for two years in Matusalem sherry casks from Gonzalez Byass, following 29 years in American white oak. Just 477 bottles are available. Freshly-ground coffee, marzipan, dark berries, and rich sherry on the smooth nose, with milk chocolate and Jaffa oranges. Smokier with water. Citrus fruits and more milk chocolate on the rich, full palate, plus roasted almonds. Long and juicy in the finish, with aniseed and fruit pastilles."
4280,"<price>45<rating>85<whiskey>Cardhu 12 year old, 45%<review>The decline in the Spanish market has resulted in Cardhu becoming more widely available, which is A Good Thing as far as I am concerned. This is a grassy malt, which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). Intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note, the palate confounds expectations, having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through, adding lift. "
4281,"<price>85<rating>85<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Highland Park) 1989 vintage 17 year old, 46%<review>Aged initially in a refill sherry cask, and then in port casks. Layers of lush fruit (red raspberry, strawberry, currant, rhubarb, and ripe peach) with underlying toffee and pot still rum adding body and texture. Peat and brine peek through intermittently, particularly on the finish. The whisky is heavy on the fruit, but it is clean and not cloying. A very soothing whisky."
4282,"<price>40<rating>94<whiskey>Old Ezra 7 year old Barrel Strength, 58.5%<review>Old Ezra’s owner, Luxco, historically has played the role of whiskey négoçiant, sourcing liquid from third-party distillers. In 2018, the company opened its own distillery in Bardstown, Ky., where it’s now laying down whiskey. While we wait for it to mature, we’ll happily savor the sourced version. This is Ezra Brooks’ first ever barrel-proof bourbon, and it’s a beauty. A spice storm of cinnamon, clove, ginger, and roasted pecan greets the palate, easing into sweet notes of melted caramel, chocolate, macaroons, marzipan, and crème brûlée. Earthy hints of sandalwood and tobacco complete the finish, making this everything a great bourbon should be. Number 7 in the 2019 Top 20 "
4283,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Gerston (batch 2/1), 46%<review>A pale primrose of a dram. Waxed lemon, salted butter pats, white peach, honey, and the wood smoke from green stems. A sip brings Highland toffee, honey, chocolate fudge, rich tart fruits, with dried apple, raisin, mixed peel, and a late appearance of malt, pepper, and smoke. It wraps up with a glossy, clingy finish, but it’s short. Experimenting with water nudges peanut brittle, pralines, and fudge to the surface. Overall, a very decent drop."
4284,"<price>58<rating>84<whiskey>Dalwhinnie Winter’s Gold, 43%<review>Distilled between October and March, matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38"
4285,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Maker’s Mark 2020 Limited Release Stave Profile SE4 x PR5 Kentucky Straight, 55.4%<review>
The second in Maker’s wood finishing series benefits from the addition of virgin toasted American oak (PR5) and virgin French oak (SE4) staves. The nose is chewy and sweet with caramel, manuka honey, milk chocolate, and wintergreen. The wood influence is right out in front, with plenty of toasty oak and cedar pencil sprinkled with sweet vanilla and caramelized sugars. The lively palate serves up candied nuts and heaps of taffy-like vanilla sweetness, coupled with some mature varnish."
4286,"<price>33<rating>83<whiskey>Kirkland Signature Highland 18 year old Sherry Cask Finish, 40%<review>An 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. But this sherry-finished Kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. Initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose, developing a warm leatheriness, with sherry, figs, melon skin, and caramel. Silky on the palate, with milk chocolate, emerging hazelnuts, sweet sherry, and honey. The finish is medium in length, with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes."
4287,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>Daftmill 12 year old (Summer 2006 Batch), 46%<review>Pure, clean malt shines throughout this whisky, the first Daftmill bottling for sale in the U.S. Shortbread, candle wax, Golden Delicious apple, rose garden, apricot, ginger, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is biscuity and sweet, with vanilla, shortbread cookies, candied pistachios, and crushed almonds; lemon and orange peel and lively rose oil perk things up once water is added. Tobacco, cinnamon, and toasted almonds and hazelnuts fade like a whisper on the gentle, soft finish. (1,260 bottles)"
4288,"<price>157<rating>82<whiskey>Master of Malt Speyside Single Malt 30 year old, 40%<review>Master of Malt is an online whisky retailer, branching out with its own bottlings. This, from an unnamed distillery, is lightly honeyed with some quince, apricot, and yellow plum, while there’s a mix of vanillin and dry bracken/grass behind. Light, clean, and balanced, the palate is refined and relaxed with Demerara-like sweetness and a finish of honey-coated nuts. I wanted more oomph on the palate, which might have come at 43% or 46%. £100"
4289,"<price>400<rating>85<whiskey>WhistlePig 18 year old Double Malt Straight Rye (2019 Release), 46%<review>The age is readily apparent on the nose, which offers notes of chamomile tea, spice cabinet, antique store, grape jam, candied orange, and balanced oak. The palate is spicy, with bright citrus flavors, orange peel, pepper, and tingly spice. Water brings out guava, lemon iced tea, and mocha. The finish offers loads of spice, with drying oak tannin and more orange peel, contrasting with a hint of vanilla sweetness. (10,000 bottles)"
4290,"<price>447<rating>74<whiskey>Hirsch Small Batch Reserve, 28 year old, 43.4%<review>Deep on the nose and heavy on the palate. Enjoyably perfumed aromas and an entertaining palate, with both showing a complex array of chewy toffee, cinnamon, candied fruit, roasted nuts, dusty cocoa, and tobacco. But a very tactile leather and oak resin component dominates mid-palate through to the finish, spoiling the party. It’s past its prime.
"
4291,"<price>99<rating>94<whiskey>Sazerac 18 year old Kentucky Straight (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2020), 45%<review>
Pure panache: roasted cinnamon, allspice berries, baking chocolate, dried cherries, grape jelly, and polished oak on the nose; with time, aromas of nougat and almond. More chewy dried cherries and grape fruit leather on the palate, along with zippy cinnamon, paprika, black pepper, and a hint of mint. Dark chocolate, tobacco, and plenty of oak add support, especially after water is added. More dark fruit and dark chocolate on the finish, as well as persistent oak that swerves, pleasantly, into leather."
4292,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye, 59.8%<review>This limited-edition rye from Knob Creek beat the odds to rise to number two by flexing its muscle to impress tasters from both the U.S. and the UK. Superlatives were in good supply: intense, massively chewy, huge, very bold, aggressive. This 9 year old, unfiltered, cask-strength bottling simply presents heaps of flavor for a fair price. Caramel-drizzled flan, charred marshmallow, and honey-roasted peanut aromas lead to mouth-filling flavors of tropical fruits, citrus oil, and peach nectar. Lemony bright with cinnamon and peppery spice galore, it’s surprisingly drinkable at proof, but water really unpacks the flavors. Number 2 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
4293,"<price>65<rating>87<whiskey>Wigle Deep Cut Rye (Batch #5), 56%<review>“Local heirloom rye grains” are distilled (less than half a mile from the Monongahela River) in a copper alembic, aged 14 months, bottled at cask strength. Has a beautiful ruddy glow. Clean, focused nose of fresh rye grain, spicy-sweet with a nip of bitter oil in the back. Not a barn-burner, even at 56%, but brimful with rye spice, rye oiliness, and rye mint, and not over-oaked, either, as the finish closes evenly. A bit direct, but very nicely done!"
4294,"<price>30<rating>92<whiskey>Alberta Premium Dark Horse, 45%<review>For six decades, Alberta Premium has been one of Canada’s favorite economy-brand mixers. Floral, herbal, and fruity, with charcoal and wet slate, this new addition to the lineup is clearly meant for connoisseurs. While the original is made entirely from rye grain, Dark Horse beefs up the flavor and body with a dollop of corn whisky and a sherry finish, creating a vanilla-rich symphony of pepper, hot ginger, pickle juice, and crisp, clean oak. C$30"
4295,"<price>1400<rating>92<whiskey>Chieftain’s (distilled at Springbank) 40 year old, 54%<review>Aged in a first-fill sherry butt. Soft sherry notes, gentle toffee, golden raisin, green tea with honey, a peppering of spice (cinnamon, red and black licorice, candied ginger, hint of coconut macaroon and brine) and undertones of juicy oak (especially on the finish). Tame, somewhat seductive, and well-rounded. Not overly oaked, and I’m not finding any off notes. A lovely whisky, but not quite as dynamic as the “classic” Springbanks I’ve tasted from the 60s."
4296,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Sazerac Rye 18 year old, 45%<review>This Sazerac 18 year old is now a distinctly separate whiskey, after several years of releasing whiskey that had been stored in stainless steel to prevent further aging. It doesn’t have as much of the rye zing as previous releases, which may disappoint those hoping for a repeat performance. Still, the new release is richer and sweeter, which I find attractive. Toffee and molasses, yielding to clove, mint, and cinnamon. Polished leather on the finish cuts through the sweetness. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016."
4297,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Bainbridge Battle Point Two Islands Islay Cask Finished Wheat, 43%<review>This wheat whiskey from Bainbridge Island in Washington State is finished 8 to12 months in barrels that previously held Islay Scotch whisky for 10 to 12 years. The nose offers cedar, beach bonfire smoke, and kelp, along with roasted pineapple, apples, and pepper. There’s more smoke, sea, and salinity on the palate, as well as meatier flavors of grilled sausage and leather, and the finish shows sweeter notes of caramel, walnut, and chocolate."
4298,"<price>150<rating>93<whiskey>Compass Box Flaming Heart 2015 Edition 15th Anniversary, 48.9%<review>Without dredging up all the brouhaha over the particulars of the component malts, this exemplary whisky has a balance you could rest on a pinhead. Earthy peats, discarded fish boxes, and crisp bacon rind combine in a smokiness you can really get into, while there is honey sweetness, macadamia nuts, and a bouquet of early summer flowers. It dances upon the tongue, sweet with toasted spices, anchored by dark citrus, and with a telling waxiness to the mouthfeel. Get some."
4299,"<price>92<rating>87<whiskey>Mars Maltage Cosmo, 43%<review>A fusion of Japanese and Scotch whisky from the owners of the Mars Shinshu Distillery, who have recently opened a second distillery named Tsunuki. Dates, treacle, red cabbage, and maitake mushroom add intrigue. Light-textured, sweet and juicy, with burnished orange, toffee apple, dark caramel, but some lackluster spices. The texture becomes fatter with dilution, as damson flavors emerge. Finish of bonfire toffee, flat cola, raisins, and spice. £75"
4300,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Benromach 15 year old, 43%<review>This spent 9 years in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks, then 6 years in first-fill European oak oloroso casks. Sherry is to the fore on the nose, with apple pie, honey, vanilla, black pepper, and ultimately pipe tobacco. A viscous and rich palate, with more apple pie and vanilla, while the sherry is drier, with new leather and woodsmoke. Salted caramel and spicy oak on the finish."
4301,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Lost Prophet 22 year old, 45%<review>The fourth release (and best so far) in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series. This bourbon was distilled at what was then called the George T. Stagg distillery (now Buffalo Trace) and spent the last several years maturing at Stitzel-Weller. It’s nicely balanced and not over-oaked, with spice (clove, cinnamon), oak resin, and leather, along with sweet notes (honeyed fruit, soft vanilla, coconut custard) and a nice creamy texture. Better than most 20-plus year old bourbons on the market."
4302,"<price>61<rating>81<whiskey>Woodstone Creek Whiskey Barrel Bierschnaaps, 47%<review>Woodstone’s using a local brewer’s beer as the basis for this one. Intriguing nose: grainy, sweet, but also a bit green/herbaceous. That's quite tasty! The malt comes through broad and sweet, the herbal character floats over the top and perks up the taste buds, almost like a digestif. The finish is tinged with honey and herbs, but dries up nicely. Smooth for the proof, too."
4303,"<price>580<rating>93<whiskey>Springbank 35 year old, 46%<review>Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices, I also found notes of roasted nuts, coconuts, orange marmalade, anise, and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture, with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish."
4304,"<price>70<rating>95<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 68.1%<review>The traditionally gentle demeanor of this wheated bourbon is jazzed up with some lovely complex spice (mostly coming from the oak). Sweet notes of maple syrup, silky caramel, blackberry jam, and blueberry are peppered with notes of allspice spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Soft leather on the finish. Great balance. A lovely whiskey! Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release."
4305,"<price>79<rating>90<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Straight Barley Whiskey, 50%<review>Straight, 100% unmalted barley whiskey. This must be a first in modern times. The huge nose gushes unusual aromas of fresh-turned earth, wet corn cobs, sour green apples, anise, cilantro, and dill. An herbal nose becomes an herbal palate bathed in soft crème brûlée and hot, peppery spices. Earthy notes turn pleasantly musty, like damp straw. Finishes long on Scottish porridge. Like all Masterson’s, this barley whiskey is from Alberta Distillers. And yes, Canadian whiskey with an “e.”"
4306,"<price>190<rating>88<whiskey>Octomore 10.1, 59.8%<review>Distilled in 2013 from Scottish barley, this 107 ppm 5 year old was matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. Quite elemental on the nose, with brine, rock pool, and cigarette ash aromas, plus ginger and an ultimate hint of nougat. Peaches on the palate, with lively spices, roasted nuts, oak, and dark peat. The finish features licorice, overt peat, and black pepper. (42,000 bottles)"
4307,"<price>51<rating>91<whiskey>Kilchoman 2007, 46%<review>The first thing I wrote was, “classic Kilchoman.” Then I paused…because it’s true. Though still young, here’s a distillery that has established its own character. In this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery, a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed, touched with churned butter, driftwood, and fresh-kilned peat. On the tongue, there’s samphire, peat, sweet barley, and an herbal kick. This is Kilchoman coming of age, assured and confident."
4308,"<price>17<rating>83<whiskey>Watkins Select, 40%<review>Nose of sweet cinnamon candy, wintergreen, and wet wood. Wintergreen and hot/sweet cinnamon carry through on the palate, with light vanilla and some pleasant oak around the edges. Happy shiny whiskey, but you realize what’s missing when you get to the finish…and there isn’t one. Incredibly quick on the finish, and pretty simple throughout. It’s like summer love: fun, but shallow and over quickly. Sourced whiskey."
4309,"<price>250<rating>91<whiskey>Teeling 21 year old Single Malt, 57.5%<review>Whoosh! Jack Teeling’s first golden arrow is this weird and wacky whiskey. Have you ever heard Jane's Addiction? This is to conventional whiskey what that band was to conventional rock. Finished in Sauternes casks, it's like nothing you've tasted from Ireland. All the Irish characteristics are there, but they're bent and twisted and put together in a new and exhilarating order. I wasn't sure at first. Now I'm begging for a refill just to make sure it all really happened."
4310,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Green Label 15 year old, 43%<review>A staple in the liquor cabinet, this hearty, malty dram conveys peppery smoke, kippers, dry spices, pencil shavings, a biscuit-like cereal note, and more pungent peat smoke as the glass warms up. Among others, this comprises Talisker, Linkwood, Cragganmore, and Caol Ila malts. Fruit follows smoke, with vanilla, pastry desserts, and peppercorn spices, becoming creamier with shredded peel, apple cobbler, and a warming finish of orange peel and forward spices."
4311,"<price>180<rating>84<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Strathclyde) 26 year old 1988 (cask #62016), 55.1%<review>An uncommon 26 year Lowland single grain whisky made from wheat and aged in refill bourbon casks. Oak is quite present on the nose, but it's not alone: there's also bright citrus, pine, and white cake. The opening is softer with vanilla and apricot, but it's only a brief respite before a very spicy mid-palate focused around oak and white pepper. There is a fair amount of fire from the alcohol, which drives a very spicy and dry finish. (U.S. only)"
4312,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead’s (distilled at Braes of Glenlivet) 16 year old, 56.9%<review>I have a soft spot for the Braes: not only a forgotten part of Speyside, but the only distillery whose roof I’ve stood on. Anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer."
4313,"<price>699<rating>92<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Pedro Ximénez Cask, 55.6%<review>Damson jam, herbal undertones, banana leaf, scallions, and clean, fresh oak notes. Burst of red fruit; raspberry, strawberry, rosehip, and sherry with lips tingling from the PX spices, citrus enters the fray, then chewy butter toffees. Wonderful complexity and flavor trajectory, it rounds off on a strawberry note. It is great to find a heavyweight whisky that is perfectly approachable at cask strength. The finish stays juicy, with vibrant spices. (502 bottles)"
4314,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Benjamin Prichard’s Rye, 40%<review>An unabashedly spicy rye nose backed by cinnamon, marzipan, Bartlett pear, and oak. The rye spice is right there on the palate and immediately joined by cinnamon, clove, black pepper, solid oak, and a lingering pear note on the fringe. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with a hint of black licorice candy. Pritchard’s rye is a perfect example of how you can have strong spice without a lot of fire, and create balance without adding a lot of sweetness."
4315,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac (2013 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 64.2%<review>The youthful, testosterone-laden member of the Antique Collection family. Bold and spicy with cinnamon and clove, but softened and balanced by thick toffee, vanilla, and honeyed orchard fruit. Lush and mouth-coating. An exercise in extremes: bold, muscular spice, along with soothing sweeter notes. While its older sibling, Sazerac 18 year old, expresses a classic “older rye” low-risk profile, Handy pushes the envelope in many directions."
4316,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Distillery Select 'Craiglodge' (distilled at Loch Lomond), Cask #329, 13 year old, 45%<review>I’ve known Loch Lomond has been making some peated expressions, and it’s nice to finally see (and taste) some product being bottled with this whisky and its sibling Croftengea, reviewed below. This is my choice of the two, with greater (and more richly textured) flavors to accompany the peat. The smoke is balanced (and tamed) nicely by sweet notes of creamy vanilla, honey, gristy malt, hay, and subtle fruit and spice. The finish remains balanced and lingers with a smoky, lightly salty tang. Fresh and youthful, yet still nicely matured at 13 years old, and a nice alternative to smoky Islay whiskies.

4317,"<price>1087<rating>89<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Massandra Connection 41 year old Sherry Wood Finish, 44.5%<review>The Massandra winery, which supplies casks for Glenglassaugh’s Massandra Connection bottlings, is the oldest in Crimea, and reputedly produced Tsar Alexander III’s favorite wines. The 1973 distillation, which has been finished in sherry casks, has a nose of sultanas, cinnamon, sweet grass, and herbal notes in the background. Bung cloth, char, and finally damp undergrowth. Complex aromatic progression. Mouth-coating, with sweet, spicy tropical fruit notes and oloroso. Slowly drying, with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645"
4318,"<price>28<rating>85<whiskey>Kinsey Rye, 43%<review>Bright grainy rye in the nose, bitter and green, with contrasting streak of sweet cola. Quite balanced in the mouth; the rye is more savory and saves the bitter spark for the finish, the sweetness less obvious, the body neither featherweight nor heavy. That’s really not bad at all. Sourced whiskey."
4319,"<price>120<rating>89<whiskey>Poit Dhubh 21 year old Blended Malt, 43%<review>Pronounced “Pot Doo,” this is without doubt a rugged coastal and/or island whisky, but on a mild and temperate day. Salt, spice, and peat are all to the fore, but it’s a gentle giant of a whisky, with some citrus drizzle and a light honeycomb heart. The main wood influence seems to soften the delivery so that the punch it packs won’t floor you. Beautifully put together, though."
4320,"<price>50<rating>80<whiskey>Spirit Works Four Grain Straight Bourbon (Batch 001), 45%<review>From Spirit Works Distillery in Sonoma County, California, pot distilled from a blend
of two bourbon formulas that feature 60% corn with wheat, rye, and barley, aged a
minimum of 4 years. Herbs, black pepper, and caramelized sugar on the nose, with
lots of minerality. The palate has notes brown sugar, fennel, bitter chocolate, almond
oil, and white pepper, followed by a finish of wild herbs and tart spices. (1,020

"
4321,"<price>55<rating>86<whiskey>Tomatin 14 year old Port Wood Finish, 46%<review>This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes, which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose, with soft fruit notes, honey, and toffee, turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate, with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity."
4322,"<price>23<rating>86<whiskey>Bushmills Original, 40%<review>Who wouldn’t love this? Aromas of vanilla, malt, cream, cake batter, mashed banana, and heady florals, with a hint of dark fruit and dry spice. There is concordance between the nose and palate; the taste is sweet and honeyed, with orange, lemon and lime zest, and well-integrated spices, then becomes creamier, with custard, banana loaf, a little dark peel, and marmalade. Honey and citrus round things off nicely."
4323,"<price>115<rating>87<whiskey>Glen Scotia Victoriana, 51.5%<review>The most expensive of Glen Scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. Soft and sweet on the nose, with peaches, fudge, and a hint of oak. Full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate, with wood spices, vanilla, and blackberries. Smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish."
4324,"<price>262<rating>88<whiskey>The Pearls of Scotland (distilled at North of Scotland) 1971, 43.3%<review>The North of Scotland distillery (formerly Strathmore distillery) was a neighbor of Cambus and operated from 1957-1980 in Clackmannanshire. Bottlings are few and far between. This one is quite forward. Apple peelings, baked apricot, cinnamon, nutmeg, sherry notes with oak wood, beef stock, and adhesives. It tastes sweet, vibrant, and juicy with red berry fruits, rosewater, strawberry cream soda, cherryade, and cough linctus. A slightly bitter finish punctures the juiciness. (310 bottles for UK, Europe, Scandinavia, and Japan) £165"
4325,"<price>29<rating>84<whiskey>Isle of Skye, 8 year old, 43%<review>What a surprise! Really thick and malty for a blend (there’s a high malt content here for sure), and also nicely mature for 8 years old. Great balance too, with the island aggressiveness tamed by a rich, malty elegance. Delicious honey, toasted oak, firm peat, dark chocolate, and glazed citrus meld nicely with the malt, leading to a honeyed, lightly-peppered finish. Very enjoyable."
4326,"<price>824<rating>89<whiskey>Glenury Royal 40 year old, 59.4%<review>A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011, this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven, which closed in 1985. Just 1,500 bottles are available, and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin, malt, nutmeg, and wood polish on the nose, with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth, slightly oily, and notably fruity, with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525"
4327,"<price>146<rating>80<whiskey>Hanyu 7 of Spades 1990 Cognac cask, 53.8%<review>Aged exclusively in cognac casks, here is Hanyu again showing its thick, earth-rooted solidity, even to the extent of some rootier elements showing. That said, on the nose, some water brings out jasmine, frangipani, and mace, with a light buttery note. It’s very spicy on the tongue: nutmeg mixed with bitter roots, but as with the Ace of Clubs, water just increases dryness. A bit too rigid for me. ¥14,000	"
4328,"<price>150<rating>85<whiskey>Murray McDavid 'Mission' (distilled at Dallas Dhu) 1979, 46%<review>Bright gold/straw color. Lively aroma of honey-drenched fruit (pineapple, red currant, citrus) with a rich malty foundation. Subtle floral notes in the background. Medium in body, but thick, almost mouth-coating in texture (a classic Dallas Dhu signature). Clean flavors on the palate-honey, interwoven fruit, vanilla, with a dry ""polished oak"" finish. 
"
4329,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>The Dalmore Gran Reserva, 40%<review>Aged exclusively in first-fill casks (60% of it sherry cask), and its oak intensity shows. Sweet, but with a steady dose of dried spice, oak resin, and teasing tobacco to back it up. Silky texture and lush, with fallen orchard fruit, tangerine, chocolate-covered orange, and lemon meringue. A firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. Sort of like The Dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids."
4330,"<price>430<rating>92<whiskey>Bruichladdich 25 year old Black Art 1994 (Edition 07.1), 48.4%<review>The nose reveals blackcurrant, damsons, black pepper, dark sherry, coconut, and nougat. Very smooth on the palate, quite full, with early oak, then leather, tropical fruits, honey, and resin notes from old component whiskies. A long finish, with mango, raisin, hazelnut, and lots of spice. Complex and intriguing. (12,000 bottles)"
4331,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Rock Town Arkansas Rye Batch #1, 46%<review>Bitter, oily, medicinally minty rye in the nose, and a pleasant undercurrent of oaky vanilla. Brisk, hot rye mixes furiously with wood notes, pear and berry esters, and a light grainy sweetness; a madly busy whiskey that’s quite fun on the palate. The finish is minty and grassy, wrapped in oak, but somewhat quick. Interesting, and delicious."
4332,"<price>27<rating>79<whiskey>Coyote Ugly, 40%<review>Slightly medicinal/mineral edge to a nose full of caramel. Hot in the mouth, slick and sweet, but with some currant and quince floating around; there’s more than a bit of youthful whiteness here. The finish stays hot and prickles the tongue a bit. A bold Canadian, with some flaws, but interesting nonetheless. "
4333,"<price>300<rating>94<whiskey>Laphroaig PX, I Love You 2005 Vintage Cask (No. 3), 54.4%<review>A single Pedro Ximénez hogshead yielded this whisky, which might be characterized as dramatic. Raisin, fig, grape skins, furniture polish, menthol tobacco, toasted wood, asphalt, and medicinal iodine on the nose. Chewy, robust, and rich on the palate, the peat keeps the cask’s sweetness in check, as raisin, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, fruit leather, hefty spice, roasted nuts, and oak vie with iodine, saline, and ash. Pepper slides into oak and tobacco on the finish, with dark-skinned fruit and menthol lingering. (Julio's Liquors exclusive; 288 bottles)"
4334,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Maker’s 46 Straight Bourbon, 47%<review>Aromas of cooked cherries and plums, caramel, cocoa powder, tiramisu, toasted tobacco leaves, cut grass, and pulled taffy create a heady first impression. In the mouth, it’s silky and somewhat light, with notes of peanut, walnut shell, cherry cough drops, cinnamon, black pepper, and cigar wrapper. The finish is short and leathery, with espresso, cocoa powder, and bitter almond."
4335,"<price>225<rating>88<whiskey>Inish Turk Beg Eternal Voyage, 44%<review>Meaning ‘the island of the small boar’, Inish Turk Beg is an island off the coast of Ireland. Its latest launch is a super premium whiskey, and it’s lovely. It’s 10 year old Cooley malt matured in casks that previously contained Irish poteen, matured on the island and brought down to bottling strength with island rainwater. The result is a rich green and yellow fruit melee punctuated with zippy spices and zingy wood notes. Expensive, but very lovable. "
4336,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Forty Creek Heritage Limited Edition 2017, 40%<review>A fan favorite now in its 11th year, the 2017 edition, Heritage, maintains the grain-forward, fruity Forty Creek house style, adding a buttery slipperiness, honeycomb, citrus peels, kumquats, marzipan, and blazing rye spices. Nutty and oily, but clean and spicy, with a never-ending finish. (under 16,500 bottles)"
4337,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Corsair Rasputin, 43%<review>Distilled from imperial stout and “vapor infused” with hops, this is a bold example of Darek Bell’s “Alt Whiskeys.” Piney hops, hot toffee, and chocolate notes fill the nose. It’s a long ride on the palate: brisk spice first, then hops and hot malt, a mealy undercurrent that pulls you from a cocoa start to a hot and sweet finish, with a burnt note on the very end. Busy, but consistent."
4338,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>Glenmorangie 1981 Sauternes Wood Finish, 46%<review>Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Golden honey Aroma: Lush and mouthwatering. Notes of honey, peaches in syrup, golden raisins, coconut, vanilla, and background resinous oak. Palate: Creamy and velvety in texture. Honey and fruit up front, with some oak notes, wood resins and vanilla mid-palate, becoming sweet again with a soothing finish."
4339,"<price>26<rating>87<whiskey>John L. Sullivan, 40%<review>Drink to the Boston Strong Boy, the last bare-knuckle boxing heavyweight champion of the world. The nose is bright: apple, pear, vanilla pod, lime zest, orange peel, puffy marshmallow, and light toffee. As the gloves come off, the palate rolls with the punches of malt, apple, vanilla, and spearmint, parrying jabs of brown sugar, caramel, and stroopwafels. It’s light on its feet and delivers nutty, spicy finishing moves."
4340,"<price>52<rating>86<whiskey>Super Nikka Revival, 43%<review>Masataka Taketsuru first blended Super Nikka in 1962 in tribute to his late Scottish wife Rita, and this limited edition pursues the flavors of the original. A dry nose of whole almond, honeycomb, woody herbal twigs, star anise, five-spice powder, and cut and dried peats. Lyle’s Golden Syrup flavors, baked apple, and raspberry coulis with a beautifully balanced, spicy accompaniment, incorporating lemongrass stalks and coconut flakes. Spicy fireworks, herbal remnants, and a slight peatiness make for a complete whisky. €49"
4341,"<price>65<rating>86<whiskey>G. Rozelieures Smoky Collection, 46%<review>A much darker dram, with smoke from log fires, chocolate, toasted oak, crispy bacon, and dark toffee, but this really drills home the smoke, which dominates over the other characteristics. Toffee, malt, dark cherry, smoking oak, cinnamon, and pepper, but tasting is a rather linear experience. Some redeeming qualities, but it lacks the focus of the rest of the range. Finish of banana loaf and singed fruitcake."
4342,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Miyagikyo Apple Brandy Barrel-Finished, 47%<review>
It’s the 100th anniversary of the marriage of Masataka and Rita Taketsuru, and there’s plenty to celebrate, with sweet red apples and soft pear on the nose, plus festive spices, peppercorn, cinnamon stick, warmed apple slices, apricot, lemon zest, and lightly charred oak. Creamy, with cooked fruit dipped in sweet syrup, vanilla, toffee apple, and honey, with just a prickle of spices swimming against the weight of the fruit."
4343,"<price>40<rating>86<whiskey>Sons of Erin, 46%<review>Zested lemon, pine-scented floor cleaner, and quite a grassy proposition with white peach, dried flowers, perfumed soaps, and orange pith. It has a slightly soapy mouthfeel with lavender, lemon curd, vanilla, and clove and pepper, the spices ramping up the intensity the longer it’s held in the mouth. Clove and bitter lemon on the finish: takes you from whimsy to wildness in seconds."
4344,"<price>49<rating>83<whiskey>Cedar Ridge Single Malt Whiskey (Barrel No. 2), 40%<review>Barrel 2 was aged in 15-gallon bourbon refills, then finished in a Cedar Ridge rum barrel; interesting to see an American distiller walk away from “straight whiskey” with used (small!) cooperage. Aromas of sawdust, toffee, melon and just-ripe apricot, dry cocoa, and warm cereal fight a bit with alcohol heat. Rum and fruit float over malt and vanilla in the mouth, and the wood rounds and dries. Oak and faint allspice in the finish. Needs some more taming; great start."
4345,"<price>350<rating>94<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare Port Ellen Edition, 43.8%<review>This uninhibited, tempestuous expression of Blue Label highlights the artistry of the blender through the judicious use of closed distillery malts and grains. Coastal notes of sea spray, lemon, dirty peat smoke, cookies and cream, After Eight mints, caramel, and dry-roasted spice aromas. Combining lemon bonbon, waxy orange, cookie dough, fondant icing, and chocolate, with tobacco smoke, hints of peppermint, and grapefruit notes, this flagrantly outclasses the Brora variant."
4346,"<price>75<rating>89<whiskey> Port Askaig 110° Proof, 55%<review>A U.S.-exclusive variant of this popular Islay single malt. Lemon juice and warm granite on the nose, backed by sweet heather, ginger, and developing Jaffa orange, medicinal peat, and charcuterie. Mouth-coating and initially sweet, before darker berry notes emerge. Savory, saline, and smoky. Medium-length in the finish, with lingering peat smoke and spicy oak."
4347,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Wild Turkey Master’s Keep, 43.4%<review>A very pricy (for Wild Turkey) 17 year old whiskey honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell. Nose is hot for the proof, with oak, dried barrel drool, warm dried corn, tobacco barn, and teaberry. Entry is not hot; rather, a thread of sweet syrup spreads out into thoroughly integrated corn and oak. Finish slides into drier oak. A fascinating journey through bourbon flavors, this is both lighter and more complex than expected. I still prefer younger Wild Turkey, but…"
4348,"<price>85<rating>88<whiskey>Barrell 9 year old Bourbon (Batch 008), 66.4%<review>There’s a lot going on here: rich caramel, soft vanilla, gingerbread cookies straight from the oven, cinnamon, marzipan, honey, and peach. Then it’s a dance of the caramel/vanilla-combo richness with brown sugar, butter, and toffee. The thing is, you need to appreciate barrel strength whiskey to capture its essence, as the beasty alcohol overpowers. Even barrel strength lovers will find a splash of water opens it up, giving more caramel, walnut, and whoopie pie. Long caramel finish."
4349,"<price>42<rating>86<whiskey>John Myer New York  Straight Bourbon Single Barrel, 45%<review>Crafted from estate-farmed organic grain and aged for 2 years. The flavors are impressively seamless, with nice complexity and everything neatly in its place. Fresh oak is well integrated with notes of orange rind, rosewater, sweet corn, and red fruits. The slick, buttery palate sizzles with peppery spice—cinnamon hearts candies and ginger. Robust in flavor, while showing impressive craftsmanship and polish. 375ml"
4350,"<price>200<rating>94<whiskey>Knappogue Castle 21 year old, 46%<review>A limited-release vatting of triple distilled, bourbon cask-matured spirit distilled in 1994 and 1996. This immersive and intense whiskey has waves of honey and fruit sweetness, floral and herbal notes, melting butter on fruit scones, macaroon bar, vanilla pod, candied grapefruit peel, and faint wood spices. Sharp orange, kumquat, and lime flavors mingle with honey, vanilla fudge, and barley sugar. Spices peak and retreat ahead of a sweet finish."
4351,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Clynelish Reserve, 51.2%<review>At cask strength this Clynelish represents House Tyrell. Split green wood followed by marshmallows on the floral nose; increasingly sweet, with a hint of cloves. The palate immediately offers classic Clynelish waxiness, with tropical fruits, honey, and subtle smoke. Licorice, black pepper, and citrus fruits in the medium to long finish."
4352,"<price>188<rating>90<whiskey>Glenrothes Minister’s Reserve, 43%<review>The oldest of a new three-strong range from Glenrothes called the Manse Brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. Serious and lightly meaty, the savory characters come at you, mixing gun smoke with cypress, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and dunnage warehouse. The headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. Moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. Keep this neat. Classic Rothes. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €140"
4353,"<price>49<rating>85<whiskey>Glenturret 10 year old, 40%<review>This 10 year old expression from the Perthshire distillery of Glenturret has replaced the 12 year old. Glenturret is at the heart of The Famous Grouse blend, and the distillery was re-branded as ‘The Famous Grouse Experience’ in 2002. Nutty and slightly oily on the nose, with barley and citrus fruits. Sweet and honeyed on the full, fruity palate, with a balancing note of oak. Medium length in the sweet finish. £31 (Not available in the U.S.)"
4354,"<price>18<rating>82<whiskey>W.L. Weller Special Reserve, 45%<review>Once a 7 year old product, W.L. Weller Special Reserve no longer carries an age statement, but the wheated bourbon still brings caramel-forward joy and hints of watermelon and fresh-baked bread. Enjoy the short bursts of crème brulee, praline, honey, Jolly Rancher watermelon candy, and a hint of nutmeg, because it’s not there long. You can see the potential."
4355,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection “New Cask” 46.2%<review>A set of two 100% rye whiskeys, triple distilled in copper pot stills, with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask, while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.
Dark in color and deep on the palate. Plenty of weight, too. A base of caramel, with warming cinnamon, persistent mint, brandy-soaked apple, tobacco, polished leather, and oak grip on the finish."
4356,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (2008 release), 47%<review>A very hearty Birthday Bourbon. Richly textured with lush sweet notes of jammy berried fruit, coconut cream pie, and apple crisp, married with firm dry notes of fresh mint, warming cinnamon, and vanilla. Dry, polished leather finish. The oak-influenced dryness on the finish lingers longer than I would like, and the flavors aren’t integrated as well as last year’s version (which is understandable, given that last year’s release was Malt Advocate magazine’s American Whiskey of the Year). This is certainly an entertaining whisky. Save it for after dinner, though.
"
4357,"<price>18<rating>85<whiskey>Jim Beam Repeal Batch, 43%<review>A delicate nose of golden raisin, Cracker Jack peanuts, pleasing citrus, and hints of clove.

4358,"<price>240<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan Royal Wedding, 46.8%<review>Rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton was this extremely limited (1,000 bottles) release from The Macallan. The nose is a mélange of rich fruits, marzipan, and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals. The palate isn’t overly grippy, with more orange peel, almond, and characteristic oiliness. A malty/nutty smooth finish makes this a great one. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)"
4359,"<price>46<rating>88<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label Lowlands Origin, 42%<review>This Glenkinchie malt and Cameronbridge grain blend highlights the vanilla character of Black Label with a nose of green apple, dry grasses, vanilla toffee, peach pit, and banana custard, with subtle hints of oak and spice. The mouthfeel is light with green apple and candied lemon, growing fruitier with boiled candies and a hint of creaminess, all held in check by the spice. Grassy finish with a hefty backdraft of spice."
4360,"<price>125<rating>82<whiskey>Glen Grant 170th Anniversary, 48%<review>Four years ago Glen Grant was in a sorry state, its beautiful gardens in need of some love and attention, its malts neglected and seemingly unloved. Then Campari bought it and we have heard very little more since. That’s until now. With a new visitor center, the gardens in full bloom, and the owners determined to make it a major player, things are looking up. This limited edition 170th anniversary bottling is made up of vintages stretching back to the 70s. They include a couple of sherry butts and some peated spirit. The result is a rich malt with some buttery toffee notes at first, distinctive lemon and green apple notes, and a touch of aniseed. Midway through, it sets off in a more feisty direction, with some peat, sharp spice, and green banana skin. Beguiling and unusual, it’s a statement of intent from an iconic distillery — watch this space. (Selected specialist outlets, excluding the U.S.) "

A powerful palate offers bonfire smoke, iodine, grilled sausage, and black pepper, with lemon oil, bitter chocolate, and light earthiness. The finish has some salinity, as well as more bonfire smoke and bitter espresso. Assertive but balanced, well-structured and smooth. A dynamic whisky that’s an iron fist in a velvet glove.

The taste exemplifies smoothness. The indulgent palate comprises dark cooked fruits, coffee, malty cocoa, sticky toffee pudding, fudge, and a fine line of orange. Roll it around the mouth: the integrated aged grains enable these select malts to achieve their full flavor potential. An exceptionally long finish has remnants of that toffee pudding and a well-sucked aniseed ball. Treat yourself."

It’s intensely spiced and herbaceous on the palate: clove-studded orange, chai, sandalwood, pouch tobacco, and more coriander and aniseed. With water, milk chocolate, almonds, and hazelnuts emerge. The finish is oaky, with hints of tobacco and persistent spice, especially coriander. Compelling. (300 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"

Rich strands of citrus, mint, and raisins mingle, building in intensity to greater spiciness at the swallow, where ginger and burnt sugar emerges. Undiluted, there is a hot, spicy, slightly acrid finish dominated by the ginger. Water adds melon, mandarin, and apple and manages to keep the ginger in check. £40"

Plunge into a pool of honey, orange, mango, vanilla, and sugary-sweet candy, shot through with little darts of spice. The finish is relatively short, with sweet pastries and light pepper, but I think ewe will like this."
4366,"<price>15<rating>72<whiskey>Texas Spirit, 40%<review>Maple syrup and gelatin capsules in a veterinarian’s office. Texas Spirit is WB Liquors’ (Costco) house brand and so, available in one size only: extra-large. A simple mixing whisky, it is sweet, floral, watery, and loaded with vanilla and caramel. Extra hot pepper throws it a bit out of balance, though it would likely go well with Coke. A young, unassuming whisky not to savor, but to session. Price is per 1.75 liter."
4367,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Bearface Triple Oak, 42.5%<review>Master blender Andres Faustinelli began with 7 year old Canadian whisky which he finished, first in tight-grained French oak wine barrels and then in air-dried virgin Hungarian oak. This wonderfully mouth-filling, fairly complex dram begins dry and closed, developing caramel, char, exotic woods and spices, berries, red grapes, luscious red wine, glowing heat, pulling tannins, and sandalwood, with butterscotch-like vanillas, luscious dry fruits, and a rich, rye-like, spicy texture."
4368,"<price>64<rating>87<whiskey>Bastille 1789 Single Malt, 43%<review>The Daucourt family from Angoulême in the Cognac region produces their single malt using French spring barley. It is aged in a variety of casks: Limousin oak, cherrywood, and acacia. The signature tangerine note is there, along with vanilla fudge and sweet, spiced dried apricots. Warming, preserved-orange notes and honey make for a buttery smooth dram with a growing spiciness, as you would expect from the French oak. A tongue-tingling spicy finish. Vive la révolution!"
4369,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Rogue Rolling Thunder Stouted Whiskey, 48.5%<review>Partial maturation in barrels that held Rogue’s Rolling Thunder imperial stout lends this whiskey aromas of hops, dry coffee grounds, cocoa powder, and vegetal earthiness; there’s also mesquite barbecue chips, vanilla, and amaretto. More beer-forward flavors on the palate, along with spice and chocolate, some dry nuttiness, and citrus oil. It’s consistent from start to finish, ending with piney hops, oily citrus, drying oak, white pepper, and roasted nuts."
4370,"<price>600<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney 25 year old, 46%<review>This 2017 release spent 22 years in bourbon casks before a final 3 years in oloroso sherry Spanish oak butts. Bright fruits on the nose: orange, lemon, and lime, with vanilla, soft toffee, and plain chocolate. Supple and silky on the palate, with sweet orange notes, more vanilla, and cocoa powder. Cocoa, nutmeg, dry sherry, and wood spices in the lengthy finish. (450 bottles)"
4371,"<price>84<rating>88<whiskey>Glen Moray Madeira Cask Project, 46.3%<review>Apricots and candle wax aromas on the early nose, with honey, caramel, and a hint of
cinnamon. Supple on the palate, with juicy peaches, ripe banana, malt, licorice, and
wood spices. The finish is long, with aniseed, spicy oak, dark chocolate, and black
pepper. (1,468 bottles) £65"
4372,"<price>26<rating>83<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Blue Label Blend, 40%<review>This mingling of Still Waters’ own mature corn, rye, and malt whiskies with undisclosed, sourced base whisky is sweeter and punchier than the Stalk & Barrel White Label blend it replaces. Clear malt notes, soft caramels, apple juice, and mild sweet flowers on the nose. The palate shows oak caramels, vanilla, and some mild white pepper. Becomes very zesty in the mouth, with a long, peppery, pulling finish. A pleasing but fairly simple whisky, more for mixing than sipping. C$33"
4373,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2020 Release), 55.7%<review>
This year’s barrel-strength release, comprised of several aged bourbons, offers bakery shop notes on the nose, along with vanillin, fragrant orange, soft spice, new leather, and drying tannins. The mouthfeel is soft and viscous, with emerging flavors of candied orange slices, allspice, black pepper, and scents of aged oak. The finish is notably smooth, as sweeter notes of tiramisu and cola are deftly balanced with an overlay of spice and dusty oak."
4374,"<price>22<rating>86<whiskey>Jacob’s Ghost White Whiskey, 40%<review>This was barrel-aged for a year, then “brightened” to white clarity; just the slightest hint of amber remains. But the aging has taken away the shouty greenness of new make; the nose is clean, a light blend of corn and woodsy vanilla. Sweet flavors bubble on the tongue: coconut, circus peanuts, peanut butter fudge, vanilla, jellybeans. The finish lingers in corn and rye. There’s more than meets the eye here, and it’s priced for impulsive experimentation."
4375,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Bowmore 10 year old Tempest (Batch 3), 55.6%<review>As cask strength examples of young Bowmore — sold at a very keen price — the small-batch Tempest range is already picking up a cult following. This third release does not disappoint in the smoke department, while the nose also shows some orange zest aromas. That said, it is a little restrained, showing its youth with a pea pod-like character on the palate, while its fruits are emerging but aren’t fully ripened. More of a strong breeze than a tempest. "
4376,"<price>38<rating>85<whiskey>Penelope Four Grain Straight Bourbon, 40%<review>Notes of red fruit, blueberry, dried cherries, Grape Nuts, lemon oil, and an herbal spiciness on the nose, balanced against an influence of drying oak. The palate is smooth and light, with cinnamon, milk chocolate, peanut shells, green pepper, and oak tannins. The finish is sweet and offers a tropical note of sweet orange and lemon. This whiskey is light, but the four-grain mashbill creates an intriguing non-traditional profile."
4377,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>BenRiach 16 year old, 46%<review>In the same genre as BenRiach 12 year old, but more concentrated, with additional notes of resinous oak, light toffee, and soft caramelized pear."
4378,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>Horse Soldier Barrel Strength, 55.5%<review>This bourbon is named for the Special Forces horsemen, known as the horse soldiers, who served in Afghanistan. The nose starts earthy and herbal, with notes of leather, licorice, and light smokiness. Drying oak on the palate, with bitter orange and herbal notes, roasted walnuts, and burnt cinnamon and brown sugar. A finish of orange, bitter chocolate, and espresso beans. Water coaxes out raspberry and honey blossom."
4379,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Jacob's Pardon 15 year old Single Barrel American Whiskey (No. 37), 69.75%<review>

Distilled above 80% ABV from 99% corn and aged in used barrels, this qualifies as light whiskey. Expressive nose of butterscotch, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut cream, candied pecan, and maple syrup on hot pancakes. Gripped by its proof from the first sip, you may find your mouth puckering from tannins and tingling with heat, but the sweet flavors of dark caramel, maple syrup, and candied nuts offer softening balance. Generous watering is highly recommended; you won’t miss a single flavor, but your tongue will recover more quickly from the high-octane ABV. (106 bottles)"
4380,"<price>385<rating>88<whiskey>Bladnoch Talia 25 year old, 49.2%<review>The revival of Bladnoch Distillery in southwest Scotland continues, with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the NAS Samsara (reviewed winter 2016). Talia has been finished in new American oak casks. Sweet and floral on the nose, with violets, Jaffa orange, and fragrant fresh oak. Medium to full-bodied, with rich fruit notes, praline, malt, and finally, raisins and prunes. Dark oak in the long, mouth-drying finish."
4381,"<price>63<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Blair Athol) 12 year old, 46%<review>This 12 year old example of Diageo’s Perthshire single malt has been matured in a sherry butt and features milk chocolate, malt, and digestive biscuits on the nose; becoming fruitier, notably with lemon curd. The palate is rich, sweet, and spicy, with barley, honey, and white grapes. Vanilla and spicy orange marmalade in the medium-length finish. £40"
4382,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>High West Son of Bourye (Batch #2), 46%<review>A blend of straight bourbon and rye whiskeys. A younger-tasting expression when compared to High West’s original Bourye. Pleasant enough to drink neat or with a splash of water, but that certainly wouldn’t be my first choice. Sweet foundation (caramel, vanilla custard, candy corn), along with honeyed fruit, macadamia, cinnamon, nutmeg, and soft mint. Comes across as a bit confused at times, and the flavors aren’t always well defined."
4383,"<price>79<rating>90<whiskey>Canadian Rockies 21 year old (Batch 002), 40%<review>A symphony of delicate exotic fruits in light syrup. The silky mouthfeel bolsters flourishes of sourish kumquats and tangerines, while a delicate oaky foundation supports bursts of hot peppery spices. Sweet Christmas spices harmonize gently with creamy vanilla. Persimmon, mild pears, sweet lemon, sandalwood, and hints of incense each take their turn. The sweet citrus finish is a fitting finale to a subtle yet complex and seamlessly integrated dram that carefully balances heat with fruit. (Taiwan only) NT$2,500"
4384,"<price>15000<rating>93<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1954 (distilled at Glenlivet), 41%<review>The nose yields baked apples, cherry blossom, marzipan, then blackcurrant cordial and a hint of coal smoke.

4385,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel, 45%<review>An elegant bourbon, and very drinkable too! Its flavors are clean and tight, with bright fruit (nectarine, tangerine,
pineapple), soft coconut, honeyed vanilla, cotton candy, and subtle gin botanicals. Polished leather and a hint of dark chocolate on the finish. Great anytime. (Exclusive to Capital City Package.)"
4386,"<price>41<rating>81<whiskey>Hudson Maple Cask Rye, 46%<review>Rye whiskey aged in casks used to age maple syrup. As penetrating an aroma as maple is, it’s very subtle here. The nose is rye whiskey—spicy, oily, bitter/minty—with just the barest hint of maple. The maple peeps up mid-palate for a sweet turn and lingers into the finish. I need to be convinced of the attraction; the maple and rye jar a bit when jammed together. And the price—$82 for 750 ml—seems crazy. Price is per 375 ml."
4387,"<price>50<rating>76<whiskey>St. Augustine Florida Double Cask Bourbon, 46.9%<review>Aged in a combination of 25-gallon and 53-gallon barrels, Florida’s first bourbon since Prohibition is 16 to 28 months of age. The honor of being first comes with compromises—a youthful, spirited profile, with clear distillate lurking just beneath the heavy surface oak, dried fruit, and cocoa notes. Slightly hot, earthy, and leathery, with Robusta coffee and oak astringency on the finish."
4388,"<price>55<rating>91<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (2013 Edition) 12 year old, 49%<review>A delicious base of creamy vanilla and rich caramel, complemented by tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe mango), golden raisin, and raspberry preserve, and jazzed up with spice (cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg). Polished oak on the finish. The flavors are nicely integrated. My favorite of the last several annual releases."

The nose offers light notes of dried figs and fragrant herbs, as well as a distinct back note of earthiness. Nutty, oily, and somewhat dry on the palate, with spice and restraining oak tannins leading to a finish that’s also dry but with flavors of vanilla and light nuttiness. (14,000 bottles)"
4390,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Fukano 10 year old Rice Whisky, 40.2%<review>Ice cream cone, vanilla, and white chocolate, with a twist of orange peel. The new and refill American and European oak casks give this a soft, milky comforting nose. The medium-weight palate includes light fudge, vanilla, and green fruits with spices on the fringes and a glowing orange core developing over time. A sweet, creamy finish with a hint of spice. This will win you over with its effortless charm. (1,800 bottles)"

The amontillado gives a more rounded feel and greater profundity to the single malt. Peaches, apricots, almonds, and soft ginger on the nose, Smooth and balanced on the palate, gently spiced and nutty, with cherries, caramel, discreet sherry, and vanilla. The medium-length finish features vanilla and lingering, spicy Jaffa oranges, drying slowly to oak. £63"

The out-turn was 280 bottles. Mellow on the nose, with fresh oranges and apples, developing toffee, and violets. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with dark chocolate, pepper, and discreet tannins. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. £400"
4393,"<price>135<rating>96<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts 13 year old 2002 (cask #20021), 54.2%<review>This 13 year old malt from central Ireland is an uncommon foray into the Irish whiskey space for the Exclusive Malts Collection. Pure malt is the focus of the nose which supports that malt with tart green apple. On the palate this whiskey is a stunning mix of lush, sweet honey, salt, malt, green apple, and ginger spice. The balance and integration are nothing short of perfect. A long malty finish caps off one of the best Irish whiskeys I’ve had. (U.S. only)"
4394,"<price>62<rating>77<whiskey>Master of Malt Reference Series I, 47.5%<review>A predominantly young blended malt heads up the first of the Reference Series, designed as an educational tool to help attune your palate. It’s a light, floral array, with waxed lemons, oatcakes, and peppermint. Mouthfeel is thin with little structure, heavy on the barley, with hints of boiled fruit candies. Sipped neat, it’s drying, with doughy notes and dried apple. Water fails to enliven the experience, other than showing late lemon and icing sugar. Memorize it, and move up. £37"

It’s a rugged, untamed, and robust part of the country, so you’d expect similar in the whisky. This is anything but. It is has a sweet, fairy dust, fruit sherbet nose; a sweet pear, cinnamon apple Danish palate; and only late on does a sharp hit of pepper appear. This only enhances the experience. €55 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
4396,"<price>200<rating>91<whiskey>Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2018 Release), 62%<review>This begins with a big scoop of banana pudding, or maybe it’s banana cream pie, since there is a lively dusting of cinnamon and nutmeg. Pretty floral notes, sweet Jordan almonds, and apple candies are well integrated with oak. What it lacks in deep complexity it makes up for with vibrancy, joie de vivre, and sheer drinking pleasure that revels in a satisfyingly long finish."
4397,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Little Book Chapter 2 “Noe Simple Task,” 59.4%<review>The sophomore effort from eighth-generation Beam distiller Freddie Noe cements his place as an innovator and a talent. For this release, Noe blended 8 year old Kentucky straight rye, 13 year old Canadian rye, and 40 year old 100% Canadian corn whisky. Uncut and unfiltered, it pours rich, floral, and fruit forward, with flavors of marmalade, grilled pineapple, guava, and gummy bears. The bright, fruity sweetness is balanced with ruby-red grapefruit and the elder whisky’s rich leather, drying oak, allspice, and dark cocoa. A fascinating and flavorful ride.

Very clean too! But what impresses me most is its maturity for its age. It’s pretty mellow for a two year old 100% straight rye whiskey. (Available only at the distillery.)"
4399,"<price>155<rating>89<whiskey>Ledaig 19 year old, 51%<review>Some of the first peated spirit produced in the late 1990s at Tobermory Distillery has gone into this bottling, which has been finished in marsala wine casks. The nose yields earthy malt, new leather, printer’s ink, and a final fragrant note. Big, bright flavors of orchard fruits and sweet peat on the palate, plus black pepper and dessert wine. Ashy peat, burnt oak, and lingering pepperiness in the finish."
4400,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>The Glenrothes, 1998 vintage, 43%<review>One thing I enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. This 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994, and while that one was elegant and bright in personality, this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. It shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. Still, if I had to choose between the 1994 and 1998, my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability."
4401,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s 150th Anniversary, 50%<review>There’s a lot going on here, and it starts in an unusual place—corn, specifically corn husk, followed by caramel, vanilla, oak, banana, pineapple, crème brûlée, vanilla, a hint of cedar, cherrywood, sautéed porcini mushroom, and cinnamon. Over a mouth coating texture, the velvety structure drips down the jawline, offering butterscotch, paprika, nutmeg, baked apple pie, bread pudding, caramel chew, roasted walnuts, and baking spice, which lingers over a long finish. Must-have Tennessee whiskey. Price is per liter."
4402,"<price>110<rating>92<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Glenlivet) 1987 vintage 22 year old, 46%<review>Whiskies distilled at Glenlivet might be easy to find throughout the world, but this is a good thing. Take this one from Duncan Taylor—it’s delicious! It’s elegantly complex, with a tropical accent (coconut, pineapple), strawberries with whipped cream, and caramel-dipped apple. The sweetness is never heavy or cloying, and it’s balanced by lovely dried spice throughout (vanilla, ginger, soft mint, nutmeg), and especially towards the finish. Nicely done!"
4403,"<price>117<rating>90<whiskey>Talisker Distillery Exclusive (2019 Release), 48%<review>Initial maturation of this expression took place in refill casks, followed by heavily charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak puncheons. The nose is relatively light, fruit-forward, slightly floral, spicy, and mildly ashy. Citrus fruits and sweet peat smoke on the palate, with fruit and oak spices. Orchard fruits in the finish, with just a hint of classic Talisker pepper. (6,000 bottles; distillery only) (£95)"
4404,"<price>950<rating>87<whiskey>Springbank 40 year old, 46%<review>Antique gold color. Mature aromas of creamy vanilla, thick coconut, oak, and a hint of mint. The classic Springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. Medium body and oily in texture. Flavors deliver what the aroma promises, with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish."
4405,"<price>194<rating>87<whiskey>Adelphi Limerick Selection Slaney Malt 23 year old, 59.0%<review>This dark, ruby colored dram rouses the senses with its nose of poached pears, raspberry coulis, cherry blossom, marshmallow, menthol, and chocolate-dipped cherry. It has a rich, throbbing fruitiness in an oily, slick texture backed by cola cubes, Tunes lozenges, and cherryade. It peters out, leaving the palate numbed with faded fruit juiciness. Distilled back in 1991 and matured in refill bourbon cask #8585, this is special occasion stuff. (134 bottles) £134"
4406,"<price>250<rating>94<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #3), 50.3%<review>A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex, dynamic whisky, loaded with lush, layered ripe fruit (red berries, tropical fruit, honeyed apricot, raisin), toffee, oak resin, polished leather, and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove). Long, warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.)"
4407,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>Mars Iwai Tradition, 40%<review>Prunes, barbecue seasonings, and hoisin sauce, sweetened by rich caramel; soak up the heady aromatics. Gloopy texture on the palate explodes into life with burnt orange, dried mango, and banoffee pie, spiraling down to black licorice, burnt oak, and Brazil nut. The name acknowledges Kiichiro Iwai’s role in ushering in whisky making for Hombo Shuzo in the 1960s, drawing on the notes diligently recorded by Masataka Taketsuru in Scotland."
4408,"<price>93<rating>91<whiskey>Kornog, 57.1%<review>Donnay also makes a peated variant. Again, the distillery’s ability to mix the heavy (in this case smoke) with the lifted is demonstrated. Think sage and rosemary, mixed with nuts and a really salty tingle that brings to mind eating samphire while the smoke wreathes the palate. Make no mistake, this is one important new whisky. £60"
4409,"<price>90<rating>87<whiskey>Four Roses 12 year old 120th Anniversary (Barrel 7-1l), 55.4%<review>Very creamy and gently sweet with a slightly oily texture. Notes of vanilla, toasted coconut, caramel, tropical fruit, honey-glazed almond, cocoa, and dusty corn. Well-balanced and soothing. A very easy-drinking whiskey. (Reviewer’s note: these are single barrel bottlings, and they will vary from one barrel to the next.)

4410,"<price>35<rating>81<whiskey>Benromach Traditional, 40%<review>Gordon & MacPhail purchased the Benromach distillery from United Distillers and reopened the distillery in 1998. They installed new stills and are using malt with a recognizable level of peating. This is first official bottling from the whisky that they themselves have made. The whisky is still youthful, but for a whisky of such youth it shows great balance, individuality, and promise. Notes of vanilla cream, honey, and fruit (pineapple, pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke, herbs, and pine. Youthful, vibrant finish. I eagerly look forward to tasting this whisky with a half dozen more years of aging."
4411,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Aberlour A’bunadh Alba Cask Strength (Batch #001), 57.1%<review>The yin to Aberlour A’bunadh’s yang, this cask-strength single malt is matured entirely in bourbon casks rather than sherry. The result is a bracingly pure whisky with deceptive simplicity; its flavors are clean and its structure precise, but it’s far from boring. The nose recalls black-and-white cookies, vanilla-frosted yellow cake, and shortbread with caramel topping, along with honeysuckle, jasmine, and coconut cream. Mouth-coating and full, it has flavors of poached pear, malt balls, nougat, lemon curd, toasted coconut, and hints of spice. Vanilla, chocolate, and nut flavors are almost endless on the finish. Add water, or don’t: this is delicious either way. Number 5 in the 2019 Top 20"
4412,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Glen Breton Ice, 62.2% ABV<review>Aged 10 years in icewine barrels — a Canadian specialty — and like icewine, comes in a tiny bottle. Sweet malt aromas, some grape character, with a brandy-like edge slicing through it. The high proof comes through as evaporative rather than hot, and it’s quite drinkable undiluted: some creaminess even, and some of that sweet icewine intensity to it. A drop of water brings more whisky out: bold, a bit hot. The icewine finishing is an experiment with promise. Price is per 250 ml.  "
4413,"<price>600<rating>93<whiskey>Royal Salute Stone of Destiny, 38 year old, 40%<review>The last new Chivas release was the 25 year old several years back. To be honest, I didn’t like it as much as Chivas 18 year old. Those extra years contributed an additional dry oak influence which I felt was a bit too dominant—especially on the finish. So you can imagine my concerns before tasting this 38 year old whisky. But this new Royal Salute has something to balance the dry oak that the 25 year old didn’t—lush, rich, sweet sherry notes. It’s quite fruity, with toffee apple, date nut cake, fig, molasses, and golden raisin up front, evolving to dried fruit, pencil shavings, tobacco, and polished leather, with subtle cinnamon and cocoa on the finish. My favorite of the entire Chivas line is the 18 year old (which I rated a 95) for its impeccable balance, but this is still a very impressive whisky!"
4414,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>High West American Prairie Bourbon (Barrel #2683), 50.1%<review>Finished 2 years in Quady Black Muscat barrels. Deep amber, ruby hues. Richly sweet, with raspberry preserve, pipe tobacco, dark chocolate, prune, honeysuckle, vanilla, and black tea. Dry leather finish cuts through the sweetness. Unique and peculiar. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)"
4415,"<price>450<rating>93<whiskey>Michter’s 20 year old Bourbon (Barrel #1646), 57.1%<review>A soothing bourbon, with maple syrup, blackberry preserve, polished leather, roasted nuts, marzipan, vanilla toffee, dusty dates, subtle tobacco, and a hint of pedro ximinez sherry. Soft, flavorful finish. The oak is kept in check, with layered sugars and fruit for balance. The price of admission is steep, but this whiskey is very satisfying."
4416,"<price>657<rating>91<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Cambus) 50 year old 1964, 49.2%<review>You really don’t see many of these. Pear drops, stewed apple, strawberry jam, fragrant rhubarb stems, and vanilla pods. Neat, there’s a tacky sweetness of hard candy, with bitter skins of damson and green plum, sloes, and custard creams. Counteract this with water to bring out acetone, cake mix, and sweet bourbon notes of vanilla and creamed coconut. Then it is triumphant. Dry oak and dark vanilla complete one of the longest finishes I’ve savored this year. (111 bottles) £420"
4417,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Gouden Carolus 3 year old, 40%<review>Very mature for its age, and with great personality. It’s a fun, lively whisky, with tropical fruit (banana, peach, coconut), pineapple upside down cake, spring flowers, soft honeyed vanilla, fruit gumdrops, and chamomile tea. Clean, light, and slightly warming finish. Lovely now, but a whisky with great potential!  Price:31 (Sold in a three pack, consisting of new make spirit, 1 year old spirit, and 3 year old whisky: only in Belgium.)€31"

On the palate, this whisky starts out clean and sweet, with notes of vanilla and honey. It then turns dry with spicy, herbal, soft fruity notes, finishing on the dry side."
4419,"<price>49<rating>86<whiskey>Authentic Whisky Alsace Double Fût #2, 40%<review>Meaning double cask, this was designed as an easy-drinking, summer style of Alsatian whisky created from a balanced proportion of two casks finished separately in local Riesling and Gewürztraminer barrels. The nose is light and crisp, with peach, pear, lime zest, grapefruit, gooseberry, and rose-flavored Turkish delight. A sweet, velutinous palate, sufficiently weighted with grapefruit and lime. A little malted barley pokes through the gooseberry. Quite distinctive, which counts in today’s market. €45"

This new Irish blend is named after the razor-nailed, sharp-toothed hoodlum who gained notoriety with the Dead Rabbits fighting gang. The nose comprises whole orange peel, boiled sugar, and dried peach pits. Sherbet, fruit polos, apple, baked almond slice, and digestive biscuit make for a sweet palate. For real street cred, Maggie needs more backbone: the thin mouthfeel needs more weight and structure. The finish is precipitously swift. Rather ordinary, though I wouldn’t tell Maggie to her face."
4421,"<price>73<rating>82<whiskey>Glenturret Triple Wood, 46%<review>Matured in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry butts, refill American oak hogsheads, and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is initially savory, with salted caramels, oak, vanilla, and toffee. Medium-bodied, with brittle toffee and spicy fruit on the creamy palate, where more savory notes emerge. A hint of bourbon in the softly spiced, herbal finish, which darkens to black coffee. £47"
4422,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Sierra Norte Single Barrel Black, 45%<review>A deeper corn note than White, the Oaxacan black corn retains a firm nugget of sweetness, aromas of banana skins and dusty earth. To sip, it’s creamy, cool, and refreshing, with light mandarin flavors, gingerbread, corn fritters, vanilla, and peppery heat from the French oak cask. The finish has gentle warmth, with root ginger and kernels of roasted corn. Distinctive and highly promising."
4423,"<price>200<rating>92<whiskey>Sweetens Cove 13 year old Tennessee Straight (Batch 1), 51.09%<review>Created by master blender Marianne Eaves for a group led by former NFL star Peyton Manning and tennis great Andy Roddick. Aromas of breakfast cereal, bananas, dried strawberries, leather, and integrated oak on the nose, and a smooth palate of Grape Nuts, allspice, bitter chocolate, pipe tobacco, and earthiness. The finish offers powdered sugar, cracked pepper, and baking spice. Future releases of Sweetens Cove are planned—very good news indeed. (14,000 bottles)"
4424,"<price>47<rating>80<whiskey>Bainbridge Battle Point organic wheat whiskey, 43% <review>A small-barrel aged whiskey. The nose is sweet and fairly simple: cotton candy, wintergreen, faint menthol, and some heat. It’s hot in the mouth, too. The mint/wintergreen gives way to light caramel and sweet fudge; it’s even a bit sticky. There’s a need for more depth to balance the sweetness, and some more age to mellow the heat. More rough-edged than ‘big distiller’ whiskey at this point.  "
4425,"<price>105<rating>79<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 18 year old Rare Auld 1993 (distilled at Aberlour), 54.4%<review>Shy is the word. Pale in color, again suggestive of little cask interaction. There’s a little hint of white currant and light cereal, delicate and fragile — more fragile than the Balmenach — with a little touch of white chocolate. As it opens, out comes violet. The mouth is tense, as if everything is still baled up, even after all this time. Very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn’t shake loose. Simply not enough cask. £67"
4426,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>BenRiach 10 year old, 43%<review>This new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. It has a gentle, sweet, honeycomb nose, with some banana, a little malt, and lemon freshness. The palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced, with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. Good price as well. Lovely."
4427,"<price>85<rating>91<whiskey>Rampur PX Sherry Finish, 45%<review>Blender Anup Barik follows up his No. 5 whisky of our Top 20 of 2017 by deploying a Pedro Ximénez sherry-butt finish to the same winning formula. Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups, tiffin, honeydew, cherry, cinnamon, nutmeg, and hints of vanilla. A mouth-clinging concoction of swirling honeys and caramel, kumquat, redcurrant, banoffee pie, chocolate ganache, and cinnamon, with emerging pepper and clove, highlighting the blender’s enhancement of flavor by the finishing vessel."
4428,"<price>80<rating>85<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at North British) 25 year old, 57.5%<review>Green grapes, fresh apple, caramel, wood spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, and digestive biscuits show the freshness of this quarter-century dram. Before the alcohol grips, sweet corn flavors and acidic-citrus fruitiness present themselves (a North British characteristic). A pleasurable, thick-textured taste of cookie dough, lime, lemon, orange Jell-o, and oak spices. A sparkling citrus finish dances on the tip of the tongue. Water discharges the taste of artificial sweeteners, so buck up and take it as it comes. (K&L Wines Exclusive)"
4429,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Distiller’s Select Straight (Batch 0037), 45.2%<review>The loveliest qualities of wheat grain are present in this delicate whiskey. It starts off with banana-nut muffin, orange Creamsicle, toasted wood, lemongrass, and bubble gum on the nose. The palate has a simplicity that’s well-executed: orange oil, toasted Popsicle stick, roasted nuts, and a full complement of oak spices. It finishes clean and satisfying, with chocolate, cinnamon, white pepper, and pecans. The definition of easy-drinking. Best Values"
4430,"<price>950<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut 10 year old Greedy Angels Peated Rum Cask-Finished Single Malt (2019 Release), 57.1%<review>The smoke on the nose is comfortingly thick and peaty, layered over cooked peaches in syrup, mango, and hints of ripening strawberry, becoming almost gum-like, with a back wall of oak and mild dry spices. On the palate, intense fruitiness assails the senses, with bitter plain chocolate, spices, and smoke. Be kind and add a generous dash of water, or prepare your taste buds for a pummeling from the cask-strength alcohol. (900 bottles, 150 for U.S.)"
4431,"<price>99<rating>88<whiskey>The Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2002 Vintage), 48.3%<review>This expression dates from 2002, when Balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. Matured in American oak casks, the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey, vanilla, and ripe red apples. On the palate, the soft smoke is well integrated with vanilla, more honey, ginger, and overripe pears. Ashy peat, citrus fruits, cinnamon, and tangy oak in the finish. An elegant peated whisky."
4432,"<price>48<rating>84<whiskey>Auchentoshan 12 year old, 40%<review>Similar to the Classic in its tropical fruit and honeyed vanilla, but with more depth, emerging nuts, and dried spice. Thicker too—with a slightly oily texture. A noticeable improvement from the Classic. This 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. It’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new whiskies."
4433,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Green Spot Chateau Montelena, 46%<review>From Calistoga, California to County Cork, this zinfandel-finished whiskey has bramble, damson jam, red apple, and glacé cherry, with cake mix, flaked almonds, and a steel-tipped edge of spice. Red apple, lemon peel, pithy orange, and crunchy red apple, teasing spice, with just a suggestion of mint mingled into the dry, spicy finish. First Saint-Julien, then Napa; where will Green Spot take our taste buds next?"
4434,"<price>3600<rating>89<whiskey>The Dalmore 1991 20 year old, 57.9%<review>After initial maturation in American white oak, this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old Lepanto brandy cask from Gonzales Byass in May 2003, ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in August 2009. Caramel and white chocolate on the nose, malt, fudge, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then burnt treacle and hot brandy. Malt, sweet spice, almonds, bananas, and fudge on the palate. Spicy fruits in the lengthy Armagnac-like finish. Cask number 1; 233 bottles."
4435,"<price>250<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Tamdhu), Cask # 7313, 34 year old, 1969 vintage, 40.2%<review>A whisky that defies its age. It is remarkably clean and fresh, with no suggestion of excessive oak. Fragrant aroma, with notes of vanilla, coconut, honeyed malt, cereal grain, and linseed. Similar follow through on the palate, with a texture that is soft, lightly oily, and soothing. Clean finish. One of the best Tamdhu whiskies I’ve tasted. 
"
4436,"<price>9500<rating>91<whiskey>The Coronation (distilled at Glenfarclas) 1953, 51.1%<review>Only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. Amazingly, the nose is not dominated by wood, but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed, tropical fruit, blonde tobacco, cedar, and chanterelle mushroom. This elegantly faded, sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned, mossy, clean, and slowly drying. A classic example of oxidation, not woodiness, allowing freshness to be retained. Amazing. (The Whisky Exchange exclusive.) £6,000"
4437,"<price>180<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Supernova (2019 Release), 53.8%<review>This is the fifth release of Ardbeg’s most heavily peated expression. The bold nose yields ashy peat, fish oil, hot lemon juice, black pepper, asphalt, and antiseptic cream. Oily and voluptuous on the sweet palate, with orchard fruits, honey, seaweed, and lots of moist peat. The finish is lengthy and very smoky, with chile, cinnamon, and barbecued meat."
4438,"<price>45<rating>89<whiskey>Daviess County French Oak Cask-Finished Bourbon, 48%<review>This evokes walking into a cabin deep in the woods, surrounded by fresh cut oak, as wisps of pine boughs and resin pour in on the wind, along with earth and warm cocoa. The palate is pleasingly plush, with vanilla sweetness that suggests orange Creamsicle, almond pastry, and plenty of toasty oak. There is also some fresh orange zest and grated ginger, with only a gentle suggestion of spice."
4439,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Caldera Hurricane 5 (Batch 0001), 40%<review>Caldera Distilling of River John, Nova Scotia sits across Northumberland Strait from Green Gables, Prince Edward Island. Its namesake whisky is made in a tiny alembic still from grain grown right on the distillery property, then blended with rye whisky from Alberta. Fruity, with oak caramels, burnt firewood, herbal tones, and glowing peppery spices. Mild vanilla, citrus pith, buttery fudge, and a long warming glow in the chest. (Canada only) C$34"
4440,"<price>52<rating>89<whiskey>Tamdhu 10 year old, 40%<review>A very welcome arrival from new owners Ian MacLeod, this has been aged in sherry
wood. As a result, you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’s
none of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before
some resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. Some of the richness is
lost with water, so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old and
is marked accordingly. Value Pick £34  "
4441,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>The Irishman Cask Strength, 54%<review>Bernard Walsh hand selects the 12 year old whiskey for this bottling, using only first-fill bourbon casks. The rich, tawny color has a nose of caramelizing sugars, gingersnaps, peanut brittle, and stewed fruits of apple and rhubarb. Rich flavors of butterscotch caramels, orange twist, oak, and that ginger intensity which persists with a slight bitterness. There’s a big hit of grapefruit as it reaches its zenith, before it mellows to a dry, nutty conclusion. (2,200 bottles to be released annually)"
4442,"<price>85<rating>82<whiskey>Balcones Texas Single Malt Special Release (Batch 1182/1285), 51.2%<review>Quite dark brown in the glass, and lots of vanilla and fruit — white grapes, pear — in the nose, with a sweet, clean floral character as well; a rich nose. Vibrant with malt and vanilla in the mouth, rather hot without water, and shot through with oakspice, which dominates the finish, though the vanilla struggles through. Water helps the heat in the middle, but not the finish. Texas is pretty darned hot!"
4443,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Elmer T. Lee Single Barrel (90th Birthday Edition), 45%<review>A limited run to commemorate Elmer’s birthday. An elegant, complex whiskey. The flavors are nice and tight. Bright fruit (dried citrus, tangerine, nectarine, hint of pineapple), brittle mint, vanilla, and gin botanicals, soothed by nougat and soft caramel, with subtle -- yet lingering -- dark chocolate, espresso, and dried tobacco on the finish. Great drinkability too!"
4444,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Balblair 12 year old, 46%<review>This was aged in a combination of bourbon and double-fired American oak barrels. Pears on the initially light nose, then malty, with soft spices, figs, and diluted orange juice. Quite full on the palate, showing more pears, vanilla, caramel, honey, and barley sugar. The finish is peppery, with lemon, dark chocolate, and black tea."
4445,"<price>120<rating>91<whiskey>Sam Houston 14 year old Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch MKT-1), 49%<review>Dripping with dark fruit aromas of blackberry, blueberry, raspberry, and black grapes. There’s also dark chocolate, leather, old barn boards, and cedar chest; everything hints at maturity and richness on the palate, which is jammy with dark fruit and shot through with bittersweet chocolate, coffee bean, polished oak, and well-integrated spice. It finishes with more of the same. Give this a few minutes in the glass before sipping, and it will open beautifully. (6,000 bottles)"
4446,"<price>160<rating>92<whiskey>Glenrothes 32 year old, 1972 Vintage, 43%<review>A very richly textured Glenrothes. A heavy, honeyed maltiness provides the foundation of this whisky, with interwoven candied fruit notes (orange, tangerine, sultana), red and black licorice, toffee, and toasted almonds. Dry, spicy, oak notes balance its sweetness and provide depth. What impresses me most about this whisky is how it evolves on the palate and continues evolving through its lengthy finish. 
"
4447,"<price>55<rating>87<whiskey>Glenrothes 12 year old, 40%<review>Light berry fruit notes, with resin, walnuts, and icing sugar on the nose. More confident berry notes on the palate, with a hint of cloves, then developing licorice, dark chocolate, and tangerine. The finish is spicy, with aniseed."
4448,"<price>55<rating>79<whiskey>Stranahan's Colorado Whiskey (Batch 13), 47%<review>Made from 100% malted barley (wash from the adjacent Flying Dog brewery) and aged for a minimum of two years. Surprisingly good for such a young whisky. Layers of sweetness (honey, caramel, toffee), with some nutty/nougat notes, bourbon-like charred oak, and background spice. Some youthful “burn” emerges toward the latter half of the palate -- a little careful aging would smooth out the finish and add depth. Still, a very nice effort."
4449,"<price>40<rating>90<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Double Black, 40%<review>So how brave can you be? Would you take one of the world's most iconic blends and risk messing with it? If you've got a whisky maker as good as Jim Beveridge, then why not? This picks up from the regular JW Black and its signature Caol Ila smoke and peat heart and then adds to it, doing exactly what it says on the tin. But the clever part of this is upping the apple, orange, and fruit content too. Great. "
4450,"<price>600<rating>92<whiskey>Tomintoul Reserve 37 year old, 43%<review>Not what you’d expect from a malt at this age. Instead of oak dominating the nose, it's citrus in focus, with orange marmalade, candied orange, and even orange blossom. On the palate this whisky is light and delicate, leading with the citrus notes from the nose. This symphony of orange is followed with toffee, ginger, oak, and rancio in a combination that's well balanced and integrated. Unique for its age, a definite treat for those who prefer lighter and more delicate whiskies. (U.S. only, 600 bottles)"
4451,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Bone Snapper Rye Batch No. 4, 54%<review>When one imagines the Indiana ryes, this maximizes every note on the nose, warming up with mint, dill, oak, macerated cherries, and a ton of baking spices. There’s a bit of a medicinal palate property in cherry throat lozenge form, followed by oak and chocolate. Its best attribute is an unexpected long finish with a big bite of candied ginger."
4452,"<price>297<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Director’s Cut (distilled at Teaninich) 1982, 47.8%<review>This 30 year old bottling from Teaninich was distilled in December 1982 and matured in a refill butt. Just 201 bottles have been released from cask #9323. The nose is characterized by lemon curd, flat Coca-Cola, and spicy malt. The palate is smooth, sweet and fruity, with vanilla and stem ginger. Autumn berries and more ginger figure in the lengthy, slightly charred finish. £195"
4453,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box The Peat Monster, 46%<review>A fantastically earthy whisky bristling with real, grubby peat: more blazing, bothy peat fire than coastal campfire. Fleeting elements of fudge and smoldering, mellow cigar stubs. A smooth, creamy blend with lemon curd, vanilla sponge, mint, smoked prosciutto, and a dollop of malt. There’s wonderfully smoky, singeing heat at the back of the palate, though it feels like the Islay peat has been pegged back for the 2015 batch. A succulent and smoky finish to warm the soul."
4454,"<price>60<rating>92<whiskey>G. Rozelieures Subtil Collection, 40%<review>Although G. Rozelieures makes several peated whiskies, this is an unpeated single malt, with notes of honey, sherbet, summer flowers, ears of barley, buttery biscuits, and black peppercorn. Matured in French oak, bourbon, and cognac casks; the balance is superb, with honey, icing sugar, vanilla, apple Danish, and spicy oak, leading to caramel and baked apple in custard. The substantial mouthfeel and serene transition of flavors make this heavenly to drink."
4455,"<price>111<rating>85<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Malt Cask (distilled at Highland Park) 15 year old, 50%<review>Unlike ‘house’ bottlings of Highland Park, all of which are aged in sherry casks, this expression in Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. It was distilled in September 1996. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with nougat and peanut butter, plus a slightly herbal note, and finally discreet, sweet peat smoke. Medium-bodied, citric, and spicy, with a little smoke. Smokiness turns to ash in the finish, with citrus fruit and caramel. £70"
4456,"<price>142<rating>88<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Laphroaig) 14 year old, 48.4%<review>Big smoke. Smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It’s a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig, in fact. £91"
4457,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Fukano 12 year old Single Cask No. 275, 41.9%<review>Brown rice, balsamic vinegar, hoisin sauce, spiced rhubarb, white pepper, and clove make this an intriguing and appetizing olfactory experience. The palate is fruitier, with dark citrus, stewed apple, star fruit, taffy candy, and orange Jell-O, drifting to light pepperiness and aniseed. A drying aftertaste homes in on orange peel, with some late spice contributions. Complex flavor combinations make this a great exploratory whisky for seasoned enthusiasts. (440 bottles)"
4458,"<price>130<rating>91<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 19D662), 47.2%<review>Initial fruit aromas play host to a savory medicinal note, like cherry cough drops or Robitussin, hinting of the formidable flavors to come as this dense whiskey unleashes waves of black cherry soda, chewy figs, stone fruits, citrus zest, and a cascade of bright vanilla on the rolling finish."
4459,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>St. George Single Malt (Lot 14), 43%<review>This release is based on a mash done at Sierra Nevada brewery, aged in eight different types of casks (including apple brandy and white wine) running from 4 to 15 years old. Delicate fruit, nuts, and sweet malt combine like perfect pastry in the nose. Add a bit of unsweetened chocolate on the palate, finishing with a lingering reminiscence of every bit of flavor, and you have a beautifully integrated whiskey that is unmistakably St. George. Delightful."
4460,"<price>92<rating>90<whiskey>Adelphi 12 year old 2000 vintage  (distilled at Bowmore), 56.1%<review>There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. A great bottling.  "
4461,"<price>22<rating>77<whiskey>80 Strong Bourbon, 45%<review>Light in body and flavor, but what’s there is well balanced and easy to drink. You’ll find notes of sweet corn, caramel coated nuts, mint, and soft citrus notes. There needs to be more of what’s already there and it needs to be more complex for me to score it in the 80s. The bourbon is designed to compete with the entry level Jack Daniels and, from a quality standpoint, it does. 
"
4462,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Smoking Ember, 40%<review>Big and smoky, but with a rich, balancing, malty underbelly. Tarry rope, leafy bonfire, rooty peat, burnt licorice, smoked seaweed, coal ash, and vanilla-tinged malt, all with emerging brine, subtle Spanish olive, and a hint of ginger. A robust, yet well-rounded, Islay-style whisky with a pleasing oily texture, though I do wish it had a higher strength for a little more attitude."
4463,"<price>325<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Imperial) 1995, 48%<review>Fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. That said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time, some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213"
4464,"<price>263<rating>92<whiskey>The Balvenie Tun 1401 (Batch #2), 50.6%<review>A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown, this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989, all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey, along with macadamia, pistachio, and caramelized fruits. As it opens, it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent. £165"
4465,"<price>200<rating>96<whiskey>Parker's Heritage Collection, 27 year old, 48%<review>Very well-balanced and mellow on the nose and palate.  Sweet notes of mature dark rum, toffee, nougat, and candy corn dovetail with dried apricot, golden raisin, hot cinnamon, soft mint tea, and vanilla.  Polished leather and tobacco leaves on a long, contemplative finish.  This is what ultra-mature bourbon should taste like: all the depth and complexity that comes with this much aging, without all the excessive oak.  The wood is there, but it never crosses the line.  The next closest Heaven Hill bourbon in age is the Evan Williams 23 year old for the export market.  There's no comparison.  The Evan Williams 23 year old is way past its prime.  This Parker's Heritage Collection has it easily beat.  In fact, this Parker's shows less oak and lethargy on the finish than the 129.6 proof expression of last year's inaugural 1996 vintage Parker's Heritage Collection, a whisky less than half its age.  (There were three different expressions, and I thought the other two were outstanding).
Parker Beam chose these whiskeys from the third floor of Warehouse U.  Given that the whiskeys were low in the warehouse, the average summer high temperatures were 6-10 degrees cooler than the top floor; helping to slow the aging process and the oak influence."
4466,"<price>27<rating>84<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Rye, 45%<review>What begins as a banana, oat, and Malt-O-Meal delight turns into honey and potato chips. This is followed by cookie dough, dark cherries, sweet-potato chips, beets, dehydrated pineapple, pine nuts, and oak. Its medium finish offers a mouthful of banana. If you love banana, you’ll love this whiskey."
4467,"<price>557<rating>89<whiskey>Glengoyne 26 year old Single Cask Distilled 1987 (Cask #384), 54.6%<review>This 26 year old single cask Glengoyne was matured in a first-fill European oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. It offers a nose of sultanas, figs, and vanilla, plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. Succulent in the mouth, the palate yields sweet sherry, honey, and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. The finish is lengthy, but dries rapidly, with lively pepper, oak tannins, and a final fatty note. £350"
4468,"<price>40<rating>78<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, (2009 release), 1997 vintage, 48.5%<review>Thick on the nose and palate. Nutty toffee, chewy caramel, milk chocolate, and molasses are quickly superseded on the palate by fiery cinnamon, dried citrus, blackberry, cocoa powder, barrel char, and teasing brisk evergreen. Long, warm, spicy, very dry, assertive finish. I like the nose much better than the palate, as I feel the dry finish overstays its welcome. A big, bold, bully of a Birthday Bourbon. 
"
4469,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Wheat 90, 45%<review>Elegant, subtly complex, and perilously drinkable. Honey tones dovetail nicely with gentle oak spice and bright fruit. My favorite of the bunch. Very lovely! Price is per 375 ml."
4470,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>Belle Meade Cognac Cask, 45.2%<review>This blend of 6 to 8 year old bourbon is finished for 3 to 4 months in casks that aged Cognac for 12 years. There’s fruit, especially dried apricot, pear, passion fruit, grapefruit, and cherry. Then caramel, oak, leather, tobacco, vanilla, and a slight hint of cinnamon. Honestly, there’s a textural brandy-and-bourbon struggle, but beautiful vanilla and nutmeg surface, ensuring it is indeed bourbon. A muted spice comes toward the end with rich caramel. Solid sipper."
4471,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Chambers Bay 5 year old Captain’s Reserve Bottled in Bond Straight Bourbon (Release 1, No. 45), 50%<review>Comforting aromas of fresh-brewed espresso, roasted pecans, warm arepas, chocolate-covered peanuts, Italian hot cocoa, mint chocolate, and hints of black cherry and grape. There’s a rich, tactile boldness on the palate, with flavors of cinnamon, peppermint, black pepper, cigar wrapper, barrel char, and lots of high-quality dark chocolate. The full finish has more dark chocolate, charred oak, spiced coffee bean, and hints of cigar. (450 bottles)"
4472,"<price>30<rating>81<whiskey>Michter's US*1 Small Batch Unblended American Whiskey, 41.7%<review>Layers of sweetness: concentrated vanilla, marshmallow, taffy, white chocolate and caramel. Subtle, underlying fruit. Palate: Again the layers of sweetness, but not to the point of being cloying or unpleasant-underlying notes of oak and minty, resinous spices emerge mid-palate and cut through the sweetness to keep it from dominating too much. Sweet and spicy finish. 
"
4473,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Tumblin’ Dice 11 year old Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>Some whiskies reveal their maturity with just one whiff, and this is one of them, with notes of varnish and mothballs, along with cooked dark fruits—cherries, blackberries, blueberries—sassafras, root beer, and rich spices. More maturity is revealed on the palate, which is tannic but not dry, and viscous, showing off blackberry cobbler, brandied cherries, pecans, roasted peanuts, cracked pepper, and ginger. An excellent, lengthy finish that draws out the fruity, rich spice and practically demands a cigar."
4474,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Laws Whiskey House 6 year old San Luis Valley Bottled in Bond Straight Rye (Batch 1), 50%<review>An unconventional flavor profile with a nose featuring fresh mint and chocolate in abundance, along with secondary notes of candle wax tinged with a bit of alcohol heat. It’s the chocolate that sticks around through the palate, as gentle sweetness is quickly swept up in warming spices and bitter Mexican chocolate, supported by flavors of nutty, honeyed malt. Enjoyable and highly original."
4475,"<price>64<rating>87<whiskey>New Zealand Dunedin Doublewood, 44%<review>What a surprise this is! After a steady run of aged and just about agreeable dusty lemon and paprika malts, this is the youngest release—just 8 years old—from the now-demolished Wilson distillery. At a guess I'd say the original whisky was ordinary, so the Tasmanians who own the stock did what Tasmanians do and finished it in port casks to make it fruity. The blemishes aren't entirely ironed out but the whisky gets away with it—and this is rather good, and at a better strength. Why bottle premium malt at 40% and your 8 year old at 44%? NZ$79"
4476,"<price>14<rating>80<whiskey>Canadian Club Whisky, 40% ABV<review>Pale, almost peach color. Light aromas of caramel, sweet citrus. Tastes of sweet caramel, faint bite of oak on the end. Simple, but clean and pleasant. You’d have to be careful mixing this — it would get lost easily — but it should be nice on the rocks or with seltzer.  "
4477,"<price>44<rating>90<whiskey>Fuji-Sanroku Signature Blend, 50%<review>Fuji-Gotemba Distillery’s talent for grain whisky is evident here, with a nose of waxy green leaves, whole peppercorn, and fleeting glimpses of lemon peel, lime zest, and white peach amid the airy, floral top notes. It has a serene, calming quality to it. Spicy pepper, orange peel, mouth-coating vanilla, creamy toffee, and crunchy apple, with a clean finish, like orange flesh laid out on
hot stones. JPY 5,000"
4478,"<price>80<rating>77<whiskey>Rabbit Hole PX Sherry Cask Finished, 46.5%<review>It’s 68% corn, 18% wheat, and 14% malted barley finished in a sherry barrel. First there’s an assortment of wood, from tree to toasted oak, followed by roasted walnuts, leather, and marshmallow. Grapefruit rind and a bitterness appear, followed by more woody notes and hints of vanilla. It never strikes the desired balance, finishing short with a hint of hazelnut."
4479,"<price>200<rating>89<whiskey>Hochstadter’s Family Reserve 16 year old Straight Rye, 61.9%<review>When bakers knead dough there’s a distinct aroma that drifts upward as the flour and water combine. That doughy goodness is found here, with root vegetable cellar and funky leather notes. Then powerful flavors drive this whiskey home: black licorice, caramel-flavored rice cakes, rye bread, paprika, cumin, and sugar cookies over a richly coating mouthfeel. Its greatest flaw is a shorter than desired medium finish with a hint of toasted pecan."
4480,"<price>119<rating>95<whiskey>Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-2), 55.1%<review>This is mature whiskey at its most refined: a balance of fruits, nuts, sweetness, and restrained oak. The nose has it all: salted, buttered pecans, rock candy, Dr. Pepper, blackberry jam, dried blueberries, caramel corn, tobacco barn, and old leather chair. It’s practically dessert-like in the mouth, with dark chocolate-covered caramel, candied pecans, Goo Goo Clusters, cherry cola, blackberry and blueberry jam, and a kiss of white pepper. The finish stays consistent, a mouthwatering mélange of caramel, chocolate, and nuts. Harmonious, seamless, and silky—you’d never guess the proof."
4481,"<price>14<rating>82<whiskey>Sazerac Rich & Rare Reserve, 40%<review>Sweet Canadian whisky nose, taffy, some vanilla. Taste is fairly rich, with notes of port and light cocoa, leading to a clean finish with a good grip. Not a tremendously deep whisky, but approachable and free of flaws. "
4482,"<price>300<rating>81<whiskey>Signatory 'Craigduff' (distilled at Strathisla), 33 year old, 1973 vintage, 47.5%<review>Strathisla whisky produced from peaty water, to create a different variant of Strathisla. The two dominant characteristics here are ripe fruit (berries, raisin, pineapple, citrus) and wood spices (cinnamon, clove, mint). The sherry cask and 33 years on oak have left their impact. The fruit and honeyed/toffee almond sweetness is to the fore with the dry spices kicking in later. They balance themselves out, but I wonder what this whisky tasted like fifteen years ago before the sherry and oak took the upper hand?

4483,"<price>3500<rating>95<whiskey>Chivas Regal The Icon, 43%<review>A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil, bergamot orange, an array of wood spices, baked apricot, dried strawberry, heather, lavender, honeysuckle, jasmine, and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palate—the strongest being mandarin, it is thick-textured yet agile—accompanied by baked brioche, Ling heather honey, vanilla, and oak, with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending."
4484,"<price>34<rating>87<whiskey>Collingwood Town Collection Double Barreled, 45%<review>The warehouses at Brown-Forman’s Canadian Mist Distillery in Collingwood, Ontario hold some rare beauties, including this one, the result of an experiment using a mashbill rather than processing the individual grains separately. Malty on the nose, with hard candies, Jujubes, and vague sour-mash bread notes. Palate is floral, gently perfumed, with sweet vanilla, mild peppers, barrel tones, and mildly pulling tannins. Long, pleasantly hot, cereal-rich finish. (Canada only) $44 CAD"
4485,"<price>139<rating>88<whiskey>Ballantine’s 21 year old, 40%<review>Baked almond desserts liberally splashed with cream, light caramel, malted milk, and an invading cloud of smoke from newly ignited twigs: a lucky strike from a forest survivalist. On the palate, it is soft and blushing, with marmalade and warm butter, ground ginger, moving to chocolate orange, toffee, and Ovaltine. A whirl of spices and chunky chocolate round off this blend’s finish stylishly. This has all the hallmarks of a perfect nightcap."
4486,"<price>90<rating>95<whiskey>Ardbeg Corryvreckan, 57.1%<review>Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008, Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed, plus dark berries, prickly spices, walnuts, lemon, and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate, with more lively spice, woodsmoke, phenols, and licorice. The finish is lengthy, with peat, sea salt, pepper, and black coffee. Editors’ Choice"
4487,"<price>258<rating>91<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Caol Ila) 1984, 54.7%<review>Clearly Caol Ila; it’s the way that the oily smokiness seems to lean into the nose, bearing with it wet oilskins, a barely smoldering wood fire, light seashore elements (drying crab shells), and very pure fruit, which then opens to classic smoked ham aromas. Retronasally, there’s a touch of green pea pod. The smokiness is more assertive than normal on the tongue, with olive oil, deep fruits, and a pine-scented juniper note. Another belter. (The Whisky Exchange only) £155"
4488,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 8 year old, 46%<review>Age adds a richer, creamier note suggestive of lighter styles of sherry, more fino or manzanilla, perhaps a cream sherry. The fruit note is more rounded, the nutmeg, clove, and pepper deliver a stronger kick. Ripe yellow fruits with melon and apple, not too sweet, followed by a sharper edge of light sherry. By comparison, the younger whisky has more fruit to balance out the nippy spices. (720 bottles)"
4489,"<price>150<rating>94<whiskey>Old Fitzgerald 15 year old Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Fall 2019 Release), 50%<review>A rich aroma dominated by vanilla, pralines, and cola showcases well-integrated wood that smacks of tobacco, candied nuts, and dark chocolate. The palate is similarly rich, full, and sultry-smooth, with no perceptible alcohol heat, just heaps of brown sugar, seductive spice, and fine leather. The maturity and refinement here are lovely to behold—fruit, spice, and earth, draped over crystalline sweetness. Collectibles"
4490,"<price>35<rating>88<whiskey>Legent, 47%<review>A blend of straight bourbon and bourbons finished in red wine and sherry casks. Lovely grain aromas, especially of porridge, along with cinnamon, clove, baked apple, citrus oil, honey-roasted peanuts, spearmint, and milk chocolate. Nuttier grain on the palate, which is led by red fruit, caramel, and lively spices: black pepper, cinnamon, allspice, candied ginger. Citrus oil, walnuts, and a bit of cigar tobacco lead into a nutty, somewhat light finish. The whiskey was distilled by Jim Beam master distiller Fred Noe and blended by Suntory master blender Shinji Fukuyo."
4491,"<price>99<rating>93<whiskey>Glenmorangie A Tale of Cake, 46%<review>
Generous and complex on all fronts: The nose is rich with marzipan, sweet oranges, milk chocolate, pistachio ice cream, and shortbread, while the palate leans more toward savory flavors of toasted nuts, dark chocolate, leathery oak, and a bit of tobacco. But it retains the rich sweetness of its namesake, with marmalade, figs, and warming ginger and nutmeg. Like the best desserts, the lengthy finish leaves one wanting more—and with so much to unpack here, that’s a wonderful thing."
4492,"<price>109<rating>81<whiskey>Wemyss Malts (distilled at Caol Ila) 16 year old 1996, 46%<review>Initially what we have are classic Caol Ila notes: cod liver oil, soft pear-like fruits, and a glimpse of lobster cooked in sea water. It’s not so much smoky as ozonic and, though it seems a little exposed with water, there’s a squeeze of lemon (for the lobster, maybe). On the tongue there’s a light ashy note before the mouth is slowly filled. Any smoke is in check and understated. This is about citric freshness and salt. £70"
4493,"<price>75<rating>84<whiskey>Bruichladdich WMD II, 46%<review>Aged in bourbon casks and then enhanced in Rioja wine casks. A mélange of red berry fruits, firm malt, thick vanilla and spicy oak, along with a hint of grape skin, anise, and orange peel. Gritty, dry finish."
4494,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Wiser’s Very Old/18 Year Old, 40%<review>A nose of hot cereal with a dusting of dry cocoa and oaky vanilla, and hints of figs and sesame oil. The palate yields clean grains — a real crack of rye among them — and oak, dried apricot, unsweetened licorice, and a long finish of warming rich cereal. Strikingly clean and non-cloying for Canadian, sweet but not overdone. Good for mixing, but equally good for sipping; a nice end-of-day dram. (Sold as both Very Old and 18 Year Old.)"
4495,"<price>27<rating>88<whiskey>Flaming Leprechaun Special Reserve, 46%<review>Cinnamon-roasted pecan nuts, cedar sticks, maple cookies, and cracked black pepper make for a parched, dry nose with alluring touches of sweetness and spice. Smucker’s Magic Shell chocolate, warm fruity notes, maltiness, and pepper on the tongue. It’s so succulent, with long spices and cocoa notes concluding a sophisticated experience. Quick, go now, before the stores close."

4497,"<price>33<rating>88<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Blue Label Blend (tweaked), 40%<review>Amping up the original Blue has pushed this blend of own-distilled flavoring and sourced base whiskies deep into sipping territory. Crème brûlée and a soft vanilla nose become Werther’s caramels, until Still Waters’ signature rye spices and white pepper take charge. Add water and it blooms like a flower, dampening the spices and leaving a round, creamy, chocolate-like mouthfeel."
4498,"<price>48<rating>83<whiskey>Milam & Greene Port Wine Cask-Finished Rye, 47%<review>The amber color portends a nose of stewed fruits—apples, prunes, and pears—as well as hazelnut and a hint of oak char. Red berries and cooked fruit on the palate, with overtones of oak tannin. Water brings out flavors of creamy milk chocolate, orange, and peanuts. The finish offers straightforward chocolate notes, and water adds length and depth. Youthful but solid, with flavors that don’t quite come into full balance."
4499,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Puncher’s Chance Kentucky Straight, 45%<review>
Bright and citrusy, this is a big handful of orange gumdrops, mandarin slices in syrup, and curaçao, laced with lemon oil and baking spice. On the palate, there is more fruit—grapefruit and melon—that comes wrapped in soft spices with the alluring flavors of root beer barrels and sassafras leaf. A medium-bodied whiskey that strikes a fine balance."
4500,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Yoichi Single Malt, 45%<review>Yoichi age statements are gone for now, but if the whisky stays this good, I can live with that. Black earthy peat, smoldering fires, a turned-out pocket of briny seashells, whole lime, lemon twist, sugared orange, ground ginger, and licorice. Silky smooth, with light, fruity sweetness developing into tangy Spangles, kiwi, and lime juice. The smoky peat is the weft woven through the fruit structure’s warp. The finish is insanely long: menthol, peat, and leather."
4501,"<price>129<rating>91<whiskey>Kaiyo The Sheri Mizunara Oak Finished (First Edition), 46%<review>Don’t get me wrong, this is delicious, but while the mizunara oak subtleties cannot match the intensity of the sherry influence on the nose, its flavor contribution to this multidimensional whisky is rather wonderful. Strawberry, sherry, fig, prune, and nuts on the nose and palate, enriched with fragrant spices, millionaire’s shortbread, vanilla tablet, base notes of pepper, and a finish of sherry, fig, and spice."
4502,"<price>30<rating>84<whiskey>Rebel Yell Small Batch, 45%<review>“Aged 24 months.” In these debased times, they should be applauded for the correct labeling of this 2 year old. Somewhat hot nose of grass, cinnamon, Pixy Stix powder candy, and oak. Simple, sweet on the palate with a crisping of rye bitterness and oak. Easy-drinking and not overly young. Color me surprised: it’s well-made for inexpensive young rye."

4504,"<price>42<rating>88<whiskey>Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Speyside Blended Malt, 44.2%<review>This great value whisky encapsulates Speyside’s appealing regional character with notes of green apple, airy florals, vanilla fudge, honey, pecan nut, toasted croissant, marzipan, and light dry spices. With its lovely structure and weight, this unwraps apple, golden syrup, tart citrus, banana, and caramel. A smart aperitif choice for a carefree day, this delivers a sweet, light, delicious dram with an active spicy finish. £32"
4505,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Highland Park 15 year old, 43%<review>A new expression due out in March, positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions.

4506,"<price>110<rating>78<whiskey>Longrow Tokaji Wood, 10 year old, 55.6%<review>I have tasted many superb Longrow whiskies in the past 15 years (not to mention some wonderful Tokaji dessert wines). This isn’t one of them. Longrow is an assertive whisky, and I can see the logic of finishing the whisky in an equally big Hungarian wine. The flavors are equal in intensity -- and this is certainly a dynamic whisky -- but they just don’t integrate well. You’ll find notes of waxed fruit, raisin, ripe barley, smoked fig, and toffee. Cloying, waxy finish."
4507,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Port Dundas 18 year old, 43%<review>This is a little darker in color than its younger counterpart (see below), although it is achieved without the complex recipe of different cask maturation that characterized the 2011 Special Releases bottling. Weetabix, hazelnut shells, and the aroma of warm pretzels from a street vendor waft out of the glass. It’s a soft, silky, wheat-flavored whisky that reaches into dark toffee and nutty territory. Imagine a molten toffee crisp, if you like. A nougat and walnut-whip finish. Distinctively different."
4508,"<price>103<rating>85<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2011), 57.5%<review>Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age, this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically, it blazes a seaweed-strewn, zigzag pathway between sea, shore, and land: bog myrtle and samphire, beach bonfire, sea spray, and melon before, with much-needed water, there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea."
4509,"<price>130<rating>85<whiskey>Bowmore 1999 vintage PX Hand-Bottled,  56.1%<review>The mid-priced Fèis Ìle release took Bowmore off into darker than usual territory. The key here was how the cask (PX is, after all, as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. Rather than being a thick, sweet mess, a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit, while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange, and both combine to layer on molasses, leather, and dark chocolate. A success. £100"

A lively, expressive nose greets with sweet notes of corn muffin, grape jelly, cinnamon sugar, maple syrup, cherry candy, and balanced oak. The palate offers rich notes of sweet almond, vanilla ice cream, blackberry tart, dark chocolate, coconut flakes, loads of baking spice, and balanced, rich oak. Excellent length and balance on a finish of dark chocolate, tobacco leaf, espresso, and more spice and oak. Great sipping, with water or without."
4511,"<price>1318<rating>79<whiskey>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1961 (Cask #1325), 47%<review>This is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead, so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. This is Glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient Marsala on the side. The palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. Too much cask for me, but if this is what rocks your boat, go for it! £840"
4512,"<price>137<rating>90<whiskey>Bushmills Port Cask Reserve, 40%<review>Sweet honey daubed on ripe plums, an abundance of barley notes, black cherry, and a smattering of exotic spices. Juicy notes of cherry, plum, peach, and strawberry, with undertones of peppery spice. The flavor fills out with lovely malty notes, Quaker Oats, and vanilla. The port cask has really complemented the Bushmills character, and this second edition in the Steamship collection is the best in the series to date. (£99; Global Travel Retail only)"

The body has heft and purpose, weaving together orange marmalade, corn cakes, root beer, horehound candy, gingerbread spices, and blueberry jam, with well-integrated oak throughout. Unlike other contenders, this hits the perfect proof. (Costco)"
4514,"<price>37<rating>85<whiskey>Bowmore 9 year old, 40%<review>The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30"
4515,"<price>75<rating>86<whiskey>A.D. Laws Origins Bottled in Bond Four Grain Bourbon, 50%<review>Same mashbill as the Laws Four Grain, aged 4 years. Hard, dry corn aromas; no sulfur. Hot, straightforward corn and oak, with active spices. One of the leanest, most austere young bourbons I’ve ever tasted; no compromises, no lush sweetness: savory bourbon. The finish is great: tingling and tasty for a long time after the swallow. Not a bonded for cocktails; sip this."
4516,"<price>85<rating>87<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 13 year old Dimensions Cask Strength 2005 (distilled at Jura), 48.9%<review>Jura has been partial to releasing 13 year old limited editions over the years, so this independent bottling attempts to compete, with grassy notes, orchard fruit, aniseed, peppercorn, lemon pith, and hints of jellied fruits. There is dried banana, mandarin, orange Jell-O, Italian meringue, and a little pepper to taste, with bitter orange on the finish. Perfectly serviceable, but the flavors seem a little stuck on repeat."
4517,"<price>48<rating>86<whiskey>GlenDronach Peated, 46%<review>The first peated GlenDronach release, matured in bourbon barrels before a period in oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. The nose offers dry, earthy peat, then becomes quite perfumed, with vanilla and lime. Light to medium-bodied, with sweeter peat notes on the palate. Creamy, with honey, cinnamon sticks, and green apples. The finish is medium in length, with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close."

Drying autumn leaves on the nose, along with leather, tobacco leaf, ginger snaps, cherries, nutmeg, black tea, vanilla, toasted coconut, and light orange. The mouthfeel is rich, and leads with coconut and unsalted butter, then cinnamon, cloves, red apple, oak, and more orange. Minerality, peppery heat, and tobacco on the finish, as well as dark chocolate and cherry."

Palate: Clean and malty up front, becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age, as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. Dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. Its finish is big and long for a Glenmorangie whisky."
4520,"<price>99<rating>91<whiskey>The Justice 14 year old Barrel-Proof Straight Bourbon, 47.1%<review>The nose is thick with peanut brittle and peanut shells, blackberry cobbler, grape jelly, allspice, dried ginger, and mint and other herbs. Beautifully mature flavors on the palate: cooked plums, raisins, and dark chocolate mingle with integrated oak, with peanuts bringing up the rear. Silky, especially in the finish, which fades almost too quickly to relish dark chocolate-covered cherries, peanuts, and smooth oak. (2,000 bottles)"
4521,"<price>3200<rating>86<whiskey>The Dalmore 1992 aged 19 year old, 53.8%<review>The most youthful bottling in the Constellation series is a 19 year old, which started life in a first-fill bourbon barrel before being transferred into a European oak port pipe in 2002 for a further nine years of maturation. The nose offers a hint of new leather, marzipan, developing caramel, and damsons. Zesty fruit, allspice, and ground ginger on the palate, along with thick-cut orange marmalade. The finish is long, warming, and spicy. Cask number 18; 737 bottles."
4522,"<price>956<rating>86<whiskey>Glenrothes 1979 Editor’s Cask #3828, 52.1%<review>Last year, four whisky editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the European markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600"
4523,"<price>300<rating>91<whiskey>Dalmore 1263 King Alexander III, 40%<review>Six different cask finishes were used for this bottling. Fudge, resin, tropical fruit, Seville oranges, and milk chocolate on the nose. Supple and smooth on the palate; complex, with red berries, orange rind, cream, cinnamon, and ginger. Long in the finish, with nougat, pepper, and dark berry fruits."
4524,"<price>500<rating>90<whiskey>Tomintoul 25 year old, 43%<review>A 2015 addition to the Tomintoul range of single malts carrying age statements, this expression was matured in bourbon casks like the rest of the lineup, but has a slighter higher ABV than most. Toffee, peaches, and newly polished furniture on the nose. Pleasing rounded mouthfeel, with Jaffa orange, honey, malt, black pepper, and developing tannins. The finish yields more malt, lively spices, green apples, black tea, and nutty oak."
4525,"<price>85<rating>88<whiskey>Balblair 1997, 46%<review>Following the initial release of a 1997 vintage Balblair in 2007, a second edition has now been launched, with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. The finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55"
4526,"<price>2000<rating>95<whiskey>The Last Drop, 1960 vintage, 48 year old, 52%<review>A 12 year old blended whisky was created in 1972 consisting of 70 different malt whiskies and 12 grain whiskies.  The blend was then placed in three sherry casks, where it was matured for the next 36 years (highly irregular, to say the least).  The quality of the sherry casks is quite evident, as is the whisky's age.  There's substantial malt content here, too.  These three factors, along with the wide range of malt and grain whiskies, combine to create one of the finest blended Scotch whiskies I have ever tasted.  It's dark, mysterious, and enormously complex, with notes of molasses, fig cake, dried fruit, tobacco, dark chocolate, old pot still rum, and polished leather, finishing with lingering cinnamon and mint.  There's no sign of this whisky getting tired at all.  I am pleased they bottled it at natural strength and didn't water it down to 40% or 43% abv, which could have ruined it.
(Allocation information:  There's a total of 1.347 bottles, of which only 350 are being imported to the U.S.  They are available exclusively at Binny's Beverage Depot (Chicago), Park Avenue Liquors (New York), and Wally's (Los Angeles))."

4528,"<price>43<rating>82<whiskey>Delaware Phoenix Rye Whiskey, 50%<review>Dark, hot brown sugar, sweet peppermint candy. A hot rye burner, but moderate on the palate: the heat's here, but the flavors come through clearly, in waves of mint, sugar, oily clove, and a brittle, sweet finish. This is no lapdog, but neither is it a clumsy, huge puppy; there's real rye character, the rough spots smoothed off by wood. A good young rye."
4529,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Low Gap Blended Whiskey 2 year old, 46%<review>Warm, delicate vapors curl from the glass: dry grain, sweet orange peel, honey candy, but all of it ethereally light. Quick in the mouth, makes other whiskeys seem heavy with wood. Sweet grain is the base of the structure, with a skin of soft citrus candy and custard notes. Wood is mostly present as a lightweight frame, almost like a zeppelin framework containing delicate volumes of flavor. This is craft, charting a new course."
4530,"<price>40<rating>89<whiskey>New Riff Bottled in Bond Bourbon, 50%<review>Fresh and delicate on the nose, with stone fruit—especially peaches—white pepper, orange Creamsicle, and spice. A generous oak backbone provides the foundation for plums, nectarines, black pepper, clove, chamomile tea, and piney cedar that sweeps into a dry oak, cocoa, iced-tea finish. Although a bit hot at times, the balance and array of flavors is an outstanding coup for this young distillery."

Exclusive Malts (distilled at Littlemill) 24 year old, 49.8%<review>The first Lowland single malt bottling to be made available in the U.S. by the Creative Whisky Co., this 24 year old cask strength, single cask bottling from the now-demolished Lowland distillery of Littlemill offers toffee, fresh pineapple, and sultanas on the pleasing nose. Voluptuous in the mouth; mellow, with vanilla, cocoa powder, and soft spice notes. Brazil nuts and old oak in the gingery finish. "
4532,"<price>34<rating>86<whiskey>Glynnevan Double Barrelled Canadian Rye (Batch 2005.001), 43%<review>Distilled in western Canada, then shipped to Guysborough, Nova Scotia, Glynnevan is re-barreled for a final seaside stint. It’s authentic Seacoast Distilling Company-brewed beer prior to distilling into whisky. Brisk, spicy nose, with oak caramels, beeswax, hints of celery, and layers of green fruit. Luscious spicy palate loaded with citrus notes, vanilla beans, and pleasing bitter pith. Earthy, alongside wet slate and sweet spices. (Canada only) C$45"
4533,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Bernheim Original 7 year old Straight Wheat, 45%<review>Wheated bourbon fans will enjoy this wheat whiskey with its distinctly bourbon nose of sweet cornbread and new oak, topped off with mint and pine aromas. It starts soft on the palate, but flavors build nicely as it rolls along, delivering graham cracker, citrus fruit, pecans, and cake batter. It remains really fresh and lovely, as caramel corn and drying cocoa powder emerge on the finish. A well-crafted and easy-drinking alternative to bourbon."
4534,"<price>44<rating>86<whiskey>Kooper Family Whiskey Sweetheart of the Rodeo Straight, 45%<review>
A sweet and fragrant nose, with orange blossom, confectioners’ sugar, coconut, vanilla, almond nougat, and a hint of tart green papaya. Sweetness is borne out by the palate’s milk chocolate and nougat, studded with orange peel, as well as vanilla pudding, brown sugar, raw pecans, and a hint of white pepper. More milk chocolate and vanilla on the short finish. Some winning qualities, though overall this whiskey feels a bit rushed."
4535,"<price>63<rating>86<whiskey>Auchentoshan Heartwood, 43%<review>Auchentoshan has launched a range of travel retail-exclusive bottlings with names relating to oak, including Heartwood, which is matured in a mix of deeply-charred former bourbon and toasted oloroso sherry casks. Soft, medium sherry notes on the nose; stem ginger, cinnamon, parma violets, and clove-studded oranges. The palate features wood polish, old leather, plain chocolate, cloves, and ginger. Dates and spicy orange marmalade on the lengthy finish. €50"
4536,"<price>38<rating>91<whiskey>Savage & Cooke Second Glance American Whiskey, 44%<review>A sourced whiskey of 95% corn, finished in wine barrels from winemaker Dave Phinney. This makes a super first impression, with Bit-O-Honey candy, eucalyptus, black cherry, cinnamon hearts, violet candies, and sandalwood. The flavors pour layered and complex, with clove-studded orange, flickers of rye spice, and pure, crystalline sweetness balanced with lemony lift. Laser-like spice, sweet caramel corn, and more floral notes dance across the long finish."
4537,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Berkshire Mountain Terrapin Finished Bourbon, 43%<review>Another from a series of beer barrel-finished bourbons from this Massachusetts distiller; this one’s from a Terrapin Brewing’s Monk’s Revenge Belgian IPA barrel. Nose is fruity and sweet, with an undertone of linen and old iron. There is the bitter and faintly piney edge of hops in the whiskey, which adds a cutting grip to the finish. Before that, there is spoonbread, oak, and a hint of anise. Interesting components, needs a bit more integration."
4538,"<price>17600<rating>89<whiskey>The Dalmore 1973 38 year old, 48.1%<review>Primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask, then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of Chateau Haut Marbuzet, previously used to hold Cabernet Sauvignon. A final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. Gingerbread, summer berries, and fig rolls on the nose. Fudge and vanilla. Black cherries, raisins, lots of lively spice, and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. Freshly-baked ginger cake in the long, spicy finish. Cask number 10; 223 bottles."
4539,"<price>126<rating>84<whiskey>Limeburners Single Malt M76, 43%<review>Arguably the world’s most improved whisky, Limeburners is unrecognizable from the fledgling releases of a few years back. This is matured in 100-liter American oak barrels and finished in port. It is big and rich in flavor, with oily fruit and floral notes, a trace of young green barley, and menthol, licorice, and spicy cardamom. Australian whisky is a tidal wave starting to swell. It has some way to travel, but when it strikes it'll be huge. A$130"
4540,"<price>64<rating>88<whiskey>Norfolk Malt ‘N’ Rye, 45%<review>St. George’s Distillery master distiller David Fitt makes scrumptious grain whiskies as well as The English whiskies, and this one has a beautiful balance of malt and spiciness, with crisp barley notes, cornbread, rye spice, peppercorn, light honey, green fruits, and some classic grain characteristics. Zested orange, lime, toasted cereal, caramel, and lovely rye notes on show, though the spiciness is a little tame. (1,962 bottles) £48"
4541,"<price>260<rating>93<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 43 year old 1972, 48.2%<review>This grand old Highlander brings warm flapjacks baked with golden syrup, nutmeg, oak spices, toffee brittle, toasted muffin, cinnamon sticks, and beeswax polish. The oat breakfast cereals and caramel beckon in a fruit explosion of mango, burnt orange, raspberry, banana chips, and papaya. Rejoice in that dense, ever-changing satin mouthfeel, with Invergordon’s grain character only more apparent toward the end. Soft spice underplayed on a dry finish. An enchanting find."
4542,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Lombard 'Jewels of Scotland' (distilled at Lochside), 1981 vintage, 50%<review>Lochside closed in 1992 and its whisky will become increasingly difficult to find. Very fragrant and quite fruity, with lemon, raspberry, red currant, and plum on the nose. It starts out clean and fruity on the palate too, with a gentle maltiness, but this is quickly taken over by dominant toffee and caramel. A nice Lochside whisky, which could have been even better with a little less toffee on the finish. 
"
4543,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Mt. Logan 15 year old, 40%<review>Rather than complexity, this all-corn whisky showcases softness and a rich creamy mouthfeel—even if it does meet the Canadian definition of rye whisky. Peppery spices with a keen bite come from the barrel, not grain. Berries and corncobs add depth to fruit cocktail, with sharp spices balancing a lush waxiness. Its syrupy feel evolves into kiwi fruit flavors and tartness on the finish. ($45CAD; Canada only)"
4544,"<price>85<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Aultmore) 6 year old, 53.2%<review>Remarkably rich color, indicative of a first-fill cask. A clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench, Comice pear, and lots of oak. Aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate, with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. The palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. Young certainly, but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. Water makes it more sappy and summery. Not hugely complex, but fun."
4545,"<price>36<rating>94<whiskey>George Dickel Bottled in Bond 13 year old (Distilled in Fall 2005) Tennessee Whiskey, 50%<review>Following Tennessee’s practice of charcoal-filtering the distillate before aging, this whiskey is soft around the edges yet delivers plenty of intensity. The mouthwatering peanut aromas evoke memories of cracking open a school lunchbox while the palate delivers abundant fruit: orange marmalade and caramel apple. Fine bitter-sweet balance suggests burnt sugar, Mexican chocolate, chocolate-covered almonds, and toffee. Indeed, sweet nuts, like French burnt peanuts, candied pralines, and marron glacé, seem to be the common thread here, lending this a consistent chord from initial nose through the drying, pleasantly spiced finish. As recently as 2016, Dickel appeared to be reeling, following the departure of two longtime distillers. In 2018, 33 year old Nicole Austin, a chemical engineering graduate who got her start with New York craft distiller Kings County Distillery, took over as general manager and distiller. Austin set about cherry-picking the warehouses for exceptional barrels, a dramatic change of course from the just-released George Dickel Tabasco Brand Barrel Finish, finished in hot sauce barrels. The result is this 13 year old whiskey, which like all bottled in bond spirits results from one distilling season—here, the fall of 2005. In this way, bottled in bond whiskey is similar to a vintage wine, making this release a limited edition by definition. We relish well-aged, delicious whiskey at a bargain price—and all whiskey lovers have reason to applaud George Dickel on hitting its stride. Number 1 in the 2019 Top 20 "

Caramel, honeycomb candy, See’s molasses chips, peanuts, graham crackers, cola, mature oak, and a little dill on the nose. The palate is chewy, with dried cherries, grape soda, root beer candy, roasted walnuts, dark chocolate, black pepper, ginger, graham cracker, cinnamon cookie, and lush leathery oak. Good development, if you have the patience to linger."
4547,"<price>47<rating>92<whiskey>Buffalo Trace French Oak Barrel Head Aged, 45%<review>Nicely round flavor profile, with complex notes of creamy vanilla, subtle tropical fruit, mocha, fennel seed, and light tobacco.

4548,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Cameronbridge) 25 year old, 53.1%<review>A rich nose of sweet, dark fruit: dates, dried fig, sultana, orange drizzle cake, honey, lemon zest, and taffy. The fruits merge beautifully with the grain to give a tightly integrated and sophisticated nose. The thick, luscious palate drips with dates, burnished orange, pepper, and clove, leading to ginger. Mouth-coating finish of cardamom and bitter spices. (474 bottles)"
4549,"<price>36<rating>90<whiskey>1792 Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Think carnival aromas—the good ones, anyway—meeting the campfire. Cracker Jacks, cinnamon-covered almonds, popcorn, cotton candy, marshmallows melting over graham crackers, and hints of smoldering oak. Next, coconut, caramel, and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee, banana, baked apple, and pumpkin pie appear. Toward the end, hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish."
4550,"<price>165<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich Octomore 08.3, 61.2%<review>One of four Octomore 08 Masterclass releases, this was distilled in 2011 from Islay barley peated to 309 ppm. Fifty-six percent of the spirit was matured in first-fill bourbon casks, while the remainder was aged in European oak wine casks. Barbecue smokiness on the nose, with wet peat and citrus fruitiness. On the palate, earthy peat, full-bodied red wine, and milk chocolate. Peat smoke to the fore in the finish, with ginger and chili. (18,000 bottles)"
4551,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Laphroaig Triple Wood, 48%<review>Initially aged in bourbon barrels before being transferred into quarter casks, and ultimately oloroso sherry butts. The sherry influence adds an additional dimension to the quarter-cask style, hence an oily nose of dates, vanilla, tropical fruits, and bonfire smoke. The palate is drier than might be expected, with Laphroaig iodine, barbecued meats, muted sherry, and peat smoke. The finish comprises dried fruits and lots of oak."
4552,"<price>146<rating>81<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland (distilled at BenRiach) 24 year old, 50.2%<review>Very fresh and quite light in color, suggestive of only light cask conversation. BenRiach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot, even some gooseberry. Very light malty background, and then a whiff of witch hazel. In time, it sweetens into banana and pineapple. The palate is clean, though pretty hot, with that mature BenRiach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. Can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95"

The Prisoner Wine-Barrel Finished Bourbon, 50%<review>Part of Bardstown Bourbon Co.’s Collaboration Series, distilled in Tennessee and aged 9 years, then finished 18 months in French oak barrels that previously held The Prisoner wine. The nose offers raspberry, grape hard candy, bubble gum, and dried orange slices. A palate of chocolate fudge, coconut, cinnamon, and baking spice leads to a finish that’s rich and smooth, with more chocolate and lively fruit. Balanced and with excellent depth; a unified, harmonious whiskey. (10,000 bottles)"
4554,"<price>77<rating>88<whiskey>Kornog Taouarc<review>Of all the releases I've tasted from this distillery, this version is the one that most resembles Glann ar Mor, stepping a big step away from the peat and toward the sort of earthy fruitiness that is typified by Glann ar Mor. There are more exotic fruits here too—kiwi and mango, perhaps—and something reminiscent of green salad. Surprisingly refreshing. €60"
4555,"<price>46<rating>83<whiskey>Copper Fox Rye Whisky, 45%<review>A 2:1 blend of rye and “hand-malted barley” lightly smoked with fruitwood, aged with apple and oak wood chips in used bourbon barrels, finished in another used bourbon barrel, aged 12 months total. Was it worth it? A good rye smell, with fruit notes; quite appealing. Relatively smooth, and the smoke comes through quickly, with sweet pepper spice and vanilla. Not overly complex, but well-made and pleasant."
4556,"<price>45<rating>88<whiskey>Santis Alpstein IV Edition, 48%<review>Whisky Advocate is moving out into the unknown, turning over the rocks and discovering beautiful and unfamiliar creatures like this one. In tiny distilleries in Switzerland, Sweden, and, er, Swansea, they're throwing the rule book up in the air and creating new whiskies based on how it falls. This has spent four years in a beer barrel and then a year in a port cask, and it's fabulous. Think licorice, aniseed, and cherry-flavored soda. Then add cream, fruit…and yowza! €35"
4557,"<price>96<rating>85<whiskey>Traditional Ben Nevis, 46%<review>An attempt to replicate the spirit produced at Ben Nevis in 1882. The malt is peated to around 30 ppm, and a first edition of 700 bottles with no age statement has been released. Initial starch on the nose, then buttery smoked haddock, a hint of chili, sherry, and gentle wood smoke. Full-bodied, spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and peat. Stewed fruit and lingering spicy cigarette ash in the finish. £60"
4558,"<price>41<rating>88<whiskey>Black Grouse Alpha Edition, 40%<review>Arguably the most successful of the Famous Grouse extensions (well, the competition includes Snow Grouse, for Pete's sake!), the Black Grouse brought ever-popular peat into the mix, a move that was followed by a peatier version of Johnnie Walker Black Label. The label says this is richer and peatier, and it is. But this scores most for a chicory/coffee and liquid licorice undercarpet that makes it very palatable indeed. Neat over ice.

4559,"<price>488<rating>92<whiskey>Port Ellen 32 year old (11th release) Special Releases 2011, 53.9%<review>Port Ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. To us, therefore, it’s Islay’s most austere malt, yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. Here, finally, is an example of that. Yes, there’s some wet slate and briny smoke, but it’s balanced by citrus, waxy fruits, and a central sweetness adding complexity. It might have taken a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait. (Editor's Choice)   "

Big whisky with no dominant notes, but enticing suggestions of pine pitch, butterscotch, barley sugars, freshwater plants, sandalwood, cream, brisk peppery spices, sweetish baking spices, clean wood with vague tannins, and gorgeous orange bitters late in the finish. Apricots, hard peaches, and echoes of raspberries throughout."
4561,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila 'Unpeated Style,' 10 year old (2009 Release), 65.8%<review>Caol Ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders, but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. Here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what Caol Ila tastes like without the smoke. Good viscosity and rather sweet, showing thick, honeyed vanilla, gobs of fruit (lemon drops, lime tart, ripe Bartlett pear, kiwi), mint jelly, and cut grass. Its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies, and Caol Ila does just the opposite. This is an interesting diversion, but I am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this Caol Ila.

On the palate, raspberries smoked over a peat fire, then served with cream, plus a slight meatiness. Citrus fruit, char, white pepper, and cocoa powder in the finish."
4563,"<price>40<rating>89<whiskey>Balcones Texas Rye, 50%<review>The nose has a bright note of lime, as well as dried herbs including coriander, parsley, and dill. Bonfire smoke and charred oak are in the mix, along with rich caramel. The palate blends sweet vanilla and toffee with smoked wood, apples, peanut shells, and a peppery spice embellishing the background. The finish is dark chocolate, espresso, peanut brittle, and more charred oak, along with a lingering, pleasant cigar aftertaste."
4564,"<price>68<rating>87<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Toffee Glaze 1997 (distilled at Clynelish), 46%<review>The latest Wemyss single cask release of Clynelish from the distillery at Brora in Sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. Freshly-sliced green apples on the nose, slightly peppery, with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. Relatively full-bodied, with lots of soft fruit, principally Jaffa oranges, and sweet spice. Spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying, medium-length finish. £75"
4565,"<price>60<rating>84<whiskey>Two James Spirits Catcher’s Rye, 49.4%<review>Cereal grains, flour-dusted breadboard, fresh cut hay, horehound lozenge, and apple pie. The appearance of Fig Newtons cookie and toasted rye bread flavors nicely complements green peppercorn spice and an herb garden edge, with good length to the salted-caramel and sweet maple finish. Pot distilled from 100% Michigan rye and aged in full-sized barrels. It’s just a touch green, but drinking nicely and totally on track. More patience will pay dividends."
4566,"<price>1900<rating>84<whiskey>Tullibardine Custodians’ Release 1970, 40.5%<review>The second release in the Custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. This 46 year old is presented at cask strength. The early nose offers herbal and menthol notes, old resin, citrus fruits, then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. The palate is quite thin, with more citrus fruits, almonds, and developing wood notes. The finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying, with a touch of black pepper."
4567,"<price>25<rating>88<whiskey>Crown Royal Maple Finished, 40%<review>With a rich nose like warm maple syrup, it’s hard to miss that this is a flavored whisky. But the maple smells real, like breakfast in a Vermont diner. It’s also good that it’s not sickly sweet and thick; the mouthfeel is like good Crown with maple flavor, not a big wad of syrup. So if you like flavored whiskies, bring on the Canadian cocktails and ice cream: this is the good stuff."
4568,"<price>34<rating>81<whiskey>Michter's US*1 Single Barrel Rye, 42.4%<review>Youthful in nature, and fairly straight-forward. Fresh, minty spice notes accompany some candied citrus fruit and some light toffee. What’s there is pleasing enough. I just wish there was more there (in both flavor and depth)."
4569,"<price>78<rating>84<whiskey>Glenglassaugh Evolution, 57.2%<review>Following on from Revival, Glenglassaugh has released 6,000 bottles of Evolution, an expression also made after the distillery’s reopening in 2008. It has been matured in first-fill George Dickel barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peaches and gingerbread on the nose, with brittle toffee, icing sugar, and vanilla. Luscious soft fruits dipped in caramel figure on the palate, with coconut and background stem ginger. The finish is medium in length, with spicy toffee.  £50"
4570,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Tom’s Foolery Bonded, 50%<review>One of the first non-Kentucky bonded bourbons since the 1950s. There’s trepidation in this glass. Floral, pear, peach, and chocolate tickle the nose, leading to relief that its aroma isn’t over-oaked like some smaller distillers’ bourbons. Apricot meets dark chocolate, mint, and smoked corn, with hints of caramel, walnut shell, and a long, chicory-coffee finish. The taste is definitely not Kentucky but is convincingly delicious, especially the bitter notes toward the end. Taste this lineage; something special is starting."
4571,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>Balcones Single Barrel European Oak Single Malt (Barrel #16009), 64.1%<review>Marrying fruit and pastry aromas, the first whiff brings angel food cake topped with strawberries, which soon develop into a jammier presentation. There are also notes of mango, pineapple, and guava, along with currants, dried chile, dry oak, and caramel. On the palate, strawberry jam and sweet mango balance out chewy oak, chile heat, mocha, and rich spice, sliding into a wave of spice, tropical fruit, smoked almonds, and cocoa powder on the finish."
4572,"<price>22<rating>80<whiskey>Jim Beam Double Oak, 43%<review>Wood. From the lumberyard to the charred barrels, wood powers over grain, caramel, vanilla, and earth. A nuttiness comes through, turning the wood into almond, pine nut, and pecan, but a resounding bitterness stays in the form of nut shells. It lacks balance and complementary flavors to the oak, but caramel finds itself on a short finish. Decent first release, but I wanted to find more nuance from the second barrel."
4573,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Omar Bourbon Cask Single Malt, 46%<review>Dried banana, curry powder, chopped cilantro, and creamed coconut on the nose, but there’s a note of oak astringency and a scent of menthol toothpaste as well. With crème caramel, banana, dried apricot, and candy sweetness, the whisky has a good weight in the mouth, and builds to flavors of tangerine, with perky peppery spices under the tongue. Lengthy finish of banana taffy and a shower of spice."
4574,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Wood’s Tenderfoot Whiskey (Batch #3), 45%<review>Here’s something interesting: all-malt, but not all barley malt, there’s some rye and wheat malt as well. The rye pokes through as fresh grassy notes, struggling with the young barrel character. Detonates on the palate: spice, fudge, vanilla, grain, and oak. This is brash, loud stuff, broad-shouldered, insistent, and cocky. Could find favor with the hophead clan of craft beer drinkers. You’d think it could use some taming, but given a chance, its boldness is appealing."
4575,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>WhistlePig 10 year old Straight Rye, 50%<review>Imported from Canada (which suggests that maybe this whiskey was originally intended to be the flavoring component of a Canadian whisky?) and bottled in Vermont. This is a 100% unmalted rye whiskey (much higher than other traditional straight rye whiskeys). Indeed, this whiskey bleeds spices (especially brisk mint, vibrant clove, and teasing nutmeg), but there’s a rich, sweet foundation to balance it all (honeyed vanilla, caramel, butterscotch, and nutty toffee), along with candied citrus and charcoal. Bold, spicy, nutty toffee, butterscotch finish. Very distinctive, and probably a polarizing whiskey."
4576,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Idle Hands 13 year old Straight Bourbon, 48.33%<review>A beautiful mingling of herbal (eucalyptus, spearmint) and fruity (cherries, grape soda, orange blossom) aromas to start, with pound cake, honey-roasted peanuts, root beer, and leather. The palate is oak-led but lively, showing expressive spice, root beer, orange, cherry, peanut, mint, and eucalyptus flavors. It finishes full, dry, and peppery, with Brazil nuts, cocoa powder, and grape fruit leather. Bottled by Proof and Wood Ventures, makers of Deadwood whiskey, and Rob Morton, formerly of New York City bar Idle Hands. (219 bottles)"
4577,"<price>70<rating>88<whiskey>Tomintoul 12 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask Finish, 40%<review>The subtle sherry adds an additional level of complexity when compared to the standard 10 year old, taking Tomintoul to a new level. Rich and creamy, with well-balanced notes of toffee, vanilla fudge, toasted nuts, and elegant fruit. A surprisingly delicious whisky for 12 years old."
4578,"<price>66<rating>87<whiskey>Shelter Point Artisanal Single Malt, 46%<review>Distillery owner Patrick Evans grows much of the distillery’s barley on his 380-acre farm on the shores of British Columbia’s Straits of Georgia. In 2011 Evans and distiller James Marinus fired up the distillery’s two Forsyths copper pot stills. The resulting single malt is creamy, malty, and slightly minty. Citrus fruits, peach pits, and stimulating white pepper slowly fade into gentle barrel notes. (Canada only) $85 CAD"
4579,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Glenrothes Vintage Reserve, 40%<review>Glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. Given that time, you will be rewarded with date, raisin, some fudge, and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel, spice and chocolate. A replacement for the old Select Reserve, this is a magnificent Glenrothes and at a great price, so don’t dare moan."
4580,"<price>17<rating>87<whiskey>Grant’s Triple Wood, 40%<review>Refill bourbon, American oak, and virgin oak are the woods in question. Technically, they are all American oak, just at different flavor-giving stages of their productive lives. Honey, fresh apricot, floral, and supple barley notes, candied orange, star anise, dried chili, and a touch of aniseed. Exceptionally smooth with caramel, date, red fruits, chocolate, and pecan pie, finishing with wood char and spice. One wood three ways, I grant you. Previously labeled as Grant’s Family Reserve"
4581,"<price>18<rating>84<whiskey>George Dickel No. 8, 40%<review>By far the “sweet spot” when compared to its siblings. The most versatile and the best value of the entire portfolio. Good enough to enjoy neat, but economical enough to use as a mixer. Caramel corn, vanilla, soft nougat, light barrel char, gentle fruit, hint of cinnamon and nutmeg.Value Pick."
4582,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Compass Box The Story of the Spaniard, 43%<review>Nobody was expecting this Spanish proposition, as the inquisitive John Glaser adds the first new permanent addition to the range in many years. Its chief weapons are Spanish red wine, spiced orange, cranberry, redcurrant, and ristras of dried red chili pods hanging in doorways. The ruthlessly efficient palate has red wine notes, spicy chili heat, and an almost fanatical devotion to the pepper. Pour a glass and fetch the cushions."
4583,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>The Irishman Single Malt Batch 1703/2013, 40%<review>The Walsh Family releases 6,000 bottles in every small batch of their single malt. Each bottling is a combination of triple distilled whiskey matured in oloroso sherry and bourbon casks. The nose is bright with vanilla icing, butterscotch, and dried peach. The taste is quite active, with honey, cinnamon, gingerbread, ground almond, and dark chocolate. There is a brief flat spot where the bitterness burns through, before it fades to leave a pleasing tickle around the gums."
4584,"<price>110<rating>82<whiskey>Smögen Bourbon Single Cask, 60.9%<review>Again, this uses malt peated to 45 ppm, which is evident by the nose of salty beach bonfires, though there is an intense, honeyed sweetness to enjoy: golden syrup bars, toasted English muffins, stroopwafel, and a cool line of spearmint. Although the alcohol roars loudly, there is honey and banana, some Tabasco heat, and flashes of orange. Water adds creaminess to the nose, but the structure doesn’t respond so well. Tough it out at full strength. (295 bottles) SEK 953"
4585,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Lock Stock & Barrel Straight Rye 16 year old, 53.5%<review>Another Lock Stock & Barrel all rye-grain whisky from the pot still at Alberta Distillers. To the sweet oak caramels, vanilla, and potent spiciness of new charred American oak barrels, it adds spring flowers, blistering black pepper, and blackstrap molasses. Firewood, Smith Brothers black cough drops, and new leather bring dimension to ever-present cloves and egg-noggy nutmeg. Canada balsam, licorice, cherries, clean oak, and the heat of high proof, then a long, hot, sweet and spicy finish with vegetal undertones."
4586,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 18 year old, 40%<review>A toasty and spicier interpretation of an 18 year old blend. Toffee, salted pecans, Dundee cake, and sultana aromas. A beautiful, thick texture replete with ripe red fruits, cardamom, fennel, and star anise. Caramels drift past on a river of spice, wreathed in a fine layer of smoke, then oak, mixed nuts, and cracker bread. The fruity sweetness is momentary and fleeting, leaving the front of the mouth loaded with spice."
4587,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Balcones Single Barrel American Oak Single Malt (Barrel #16582), 63.3%<review>Persimmon pudding, guava juice, baked apple, blueberry, and pineapple on the nose, as well as fresh clay, pencil shavings, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and salty ham. The palate is big and chewy, with Popsicle stick, dried chile, roasted nuts, black pepper, and juicy guava and pineapple. More tropical fruit rounds out the palate, mingling with pepper, nuts, and plenty of dry oak."
4588,"<price>35<rating>90<whiskey>Willett Single Barrel Estate Reserve, Barrel # A-4614, 47%<review>Bottled in a glass pot still decanter. Soft and elegant on the nose and palate, and very well balanced. An incredibly drinkable whiskey. There’s no age statement on the bottle, but it was bottled at just the right time, based on its great balance of flavors. Notes of vanilla, coconut, and crème brulee provide a base for emerging notes of cedar wood shavings, cinnamon, soft mint, and a hint of fennel. A very graceful bourbon.

They’re pronounced and rounded, with secondary and tertiary notes introducing malt, cornbread, and salt water taffy. The medium finish offers a hint of bacon bits."
4590,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>1792 Single Barrel, 49.3%<review>Ripe fruit (peach, apricot, golden raisin) on the front of the palate, followed by layered sweet notes of caramel, butterscotch, and toffee, finishing with oak, dried vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon. Great mouthfeel. Each barrel is unique in flavor profile. There’s no barrel number identified on the label, so the one you buy may vary slightly. Having said this, the barrel I reviewed was very enjoyable."
4591,"<price>70<rating>86<whiskey>Bladnoch 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range, 43%<review>This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial."
4592,"<price>89<rating>90<whiskey>Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength, 53%<review>Fully matured in mizunara oak on land and sea, this has tangy orange, ground ginger, fennel seed, cedar, and incense, though it seems a little more tightly wound than the standard strength whisky. Juicy orange, quick firecracker spices, and more toffee sweetness; it becomes heavy and thick, flaunting high alcohol, then turns creamier with marzipan, orange Jell-O, and singed oak spices."
4593,"<price>220<rating>88<whiskey>Kurayoshi 18 year old, 50%<review>The high-alcohol strength is apparent on the nose, which is dominated by pepper, clove, and star anise spices. A mouth-drawing concoction that begins softly, with honey, orange, and apple peel, then grows in scale at the expense of the sweetness. There’s a takeover by root ginger and bitter fruit skins. The long-lasting finish reverberates with crackling spices and sour fruits. (1,140 bottles)"
4594,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Buchanan’s Deluxe 12 year old, 40%<review>Overlook the fact that this bottle is saddled with one of the most impenetrable closures known to mankind. Unperturbed, this blend flaunts its big toffee aromas, whole almond, and floral top notes. With light fudge and gentle orange influences, it is smooth and rounded, top loaded with spice and hazelnut at the front of the mouth. More grain character and roasted spices show through on the finish."
4595,"<price>302<rating>80<whiskey>Port Askaig 30 year old Cask Strength, 51.1%<review>The oldest of the new trio, here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed, accenting the peapod and spearmint, giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements. There are light levels of complexity, even a little chocolate. The tongue, when neat, goes deep into pear and apple, but it’s edgy. Adding water, however, shows the lack of oak integration. I’d want more from a whisky of this age (and price). £199"
4596,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Cured Oak, 50%<review>The barrel staves used to age this whiskey dried outside in the open for 13 months. The oak influence is certainly evident—both from the cured oak staves and from the fact that the whiskey is 17 years old—but never overpowers. Plentiful spice notes (especially cinnamon and vanilla) are tamed by lovely sweetness (toffee, dates, nougat) and energized by bright fruit. Long, dry, warming finish. One of the better Taylors."
4597,"<price>140<rating>92<whiskey>Ardbeg Blaaack, 46%<review>Bottled to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Ardbeg Committee. Woodsmoke on the nose, with coal fires, cedar, canned fruit cocktail, and mild antiseptic. Supple and sweet on the palate, with orchard fruits and an emerging wave of peppery, prickly peat smoke. Long in the sooty finish. Lively, with chile paste."

The nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42"
4599,"<price>26<rating>93<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 2003 Vintage (Barrel No. 1), 43.3%<review>Silky smooth. Lush honey notes married with bright orchard fruit and candied tropical fruit. Soft vanilla, mint, and cinnamon round out the palate. Seamless and perilously drinkable. Proof that a bourbon doesn’t have to be old, high in alcohol, or expensive to be good.

Savory on the nose, with smoky brine, plain chocolate, and Granny Smith apples. The palate offers similar green apple notes, along with sweet peat, cocoa, and licorice. Wood smoke and pipe tobacco in the medium-length finish."
4601,"<price>92<rating>87<whiskey>Kilchoman 100% Islay 3rd Edition, 50%<review>Here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke, all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank, but bright and flaming. The palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through, then it sweetens like golden syrup, then the shore comes back, and so it continues. Water ups the impact of each, so be careful, as it can then seem disconnected. Sweet, beachy, smoky. Very Islay."
4602,"<price>48<rating>89<whiskey>William Larue Weller 12 year old, 61%<review>Keeping in the Weller tradition, this one is a wheated bourbon. Some wheated bourbons, although easy to drink, can taste a bit too sweet without the spicy rye notes in there. The better ones are often aged a little longer and/or bottled at higher strengths, where the wood and alcohol accompany the sweetness. You’ll find soothingly rich toffee, caramel fudge, dates, and nougat brightened up by berried fruit, and a hint of dusty corn. Gently sweet finish.

The nose offers a whiff of soy sauce, honey, and blotting paper. Salty and spicy on the palate, with green apple, walnut, and cloves. Jaffa orange and black pepper in the long finish. (8,544 bottles)"
4604,"<price>60<rating>90<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Island Green, 43%<review>What happens when you light a bonfire underneath Green Label? Earthy peat smoke with medicinal characteristics of lanolin and antiseptic, a salty tang balanced with creamy vanilla, strands of citrus, and touches of menthol and aniseed. Smooth as a thief in the night; mouth-coating toffee, growing smoky notes, and peppered mackerel push back the waxy, citrus elements. Now the fire is alive; the sweetness gets out while it can.

4605,"<price>300<rating>95<whiskey>Ardbeg 19 year old Traigh Bhan, 46.2%<review>Ardbeg’s first core bottling with an age statement in nearly 20 years was matured in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. Rock pools, fabric Band-Aids, coal dust, licorice, hot peat, pineapple, and a seafood platter on the complex nose. The palate is oily, with smoked fish, overt peat smoke, chili, iodine, and lemon. Long in the finish, with more iodine and peppery peat. A delightfully traditional Ardbeg."
4606,"<price>100<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Delilah’s XXV, 46%<review>Dried heather, peppercorn, salt crystals, green fruits, dried fennel, aniseed, dry leaves, and floral top notes produce a lip-smacking bouquet like a chilled manzanilla. The palate has vanilla tablet sweetness like the previous Delilah’s release, though this is bottled at higher strength, with flavors of dried fruits: peach, apricot, and mandarin. (8,520 bottles)"
4607,"<price>18<rating>77<whiskey>Grand Macnish 150th Anniversary Edition, 40%<review>Robert McNish conceived his recipe for a lighter style of Highland whisky in Glasgow in 1863 (though the brand added an ‘a’ to his surname for easier pronunciation). Whole orange, ground hazelnut, and ground ginger on the nose, though it keeps pretty tight-lipped. Light and sweet in the mouth, with mandarin and more pronounced ginger mid-palate before a medium-length finish of bubblegum and gooseberry. It just seems a little uninspiring given the special occasion."
4608,"<price>50<rating>83<whiskey>Popcorn Sutton Barrel Finished, 46%<review>“Spirits distilled from grain and sugar” on the label, and the word “whiskey” is nowhere to be seen, but we’ve stretched the definition before; and this stuff tasted okay unaged. Smells like oak candy wrapped in fresh leaves. A bit hot, but like warm cereal on the tongue, and the oak fills in the back. Sippable, and likely to make a good Old-Fashioned as well."
4609,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>High West 16 year old Rocky Mountain Rye (Batch #1), 46%<review>Made from a mash containing a whopping 80% rye. The antithesis of the 21 year old reviewed above. This is one bold rye whiskey which gets more powerful as it develops on the palate. It’s crisp, clean, and very spicy (cool mint, hot cinnamon), with molasses, caramel, honey, golden raisin, kiwi, coconut shavings, and a dusting of cocoa. A lighter-weight whiskey when compared to High West’s flagship Rendezvous Rye, but this whiskey throws a mean punch!"
4610,"<price>23427<rating>91<whiskey>Tullibardine 1952, 40.2%<review>This bottling is from the oldest cask owned by Tullibardine distillery, a sherry quarter cask (#341). An initial whiff of Cointreau on the nose, then vanilla develops, with marzipan, white pepper, linseed, and old hessian. Finally, musty sherry. A silky mouthfeel, with drier sherry, black currants, dark spices, and plain chocolate. Extraordinarily lingering, with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. Despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask, a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16,000"
4611,"<price>105<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 16 year old, 48.4%<review>Light gold. Fresh and clean, with light draff notes. Cool porcelain, lemon, cereal husk. It becomes more expressive on the tongue, though it remains subtle. A bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice, cinnamon toast, and baklava. The finish reveals some green notes. When you add water, it becomes incredibly minty. Fragile, but if you fancy a Bunna' julep, then look no further. £69"
4612,"<price>205<rating>88<whiskey>Caol Ila, 25 Year Old, 43%<review>This is to be a permanent addition to the core Caol Ila range, but it will raise a few eyebrows, completely ignoring the current peat battle between Ardbeg and Bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. This is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn’t give everything up immediately. There’s soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there’s a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive. (Limited general releases, excluding the U.S.) "
4613,"<price>300<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Hedonism Maximus<review>An older, more exotic expression of Hedonism, consisting of 42 year old Invergordon and 29 year old Cameron Bridge grain whiskies. Straw gold color. This is richer and cleaner than most other grain whisky offerings, which are often too thin and overweight with dry oak. Like many older grain whiskies, creamy vanilla, coconut custard, and a variety of tropical fruits abound. Additional notes of toasted marshmallow, caramelized apricot, golden raisin, and a gentle dried spice finish add complexity. Surely one of the better examples of this rather eccentric category."
4614,"<price>45<rating>87<whiskey>Santis Malt Edition Germany, 48%<review>This is whisky made in a European style; don't expect scotch. Reset your taste buds, free your mind. This is 6 years old and spent five and a half of them in a beer barrel—the whisky is made from an award winning beer—and six months in a Merlot wine cask. It's fabulous. Honeycomb, creamy toffee caramel, European sappiness. It's slightly flabby, like an overfed but much-loved puppy. €35  "
4615,"<price>119<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts ‘Lemon Grove’ (distilled at Cragganmore) 1989 (bottled 2011), 46% <review>Cragganmore is a whisky that typically needs time before it starts to get going and which then goes through many changes on its journey to its complex, layered apogee. Here it is at a slightly contradictory midpoint. The nose is fragrant and fruity: apricots, stewed apple, and yes, lemon; and, with water, a hint of smoke. The palate meanwhile shows more of the earthy depth and sloe berry richness that will slowly emerge. A pleasing dram, nonetheless. £75"
4616,"<price>130<rating>82<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenallachie) 22 year old, 51.5%<review>Light gold. A little shy initially, but Glenallachie isn’t noted for its effusiveness. It has a clean and slightly nutty aroma, with light honey alongside grilled hazelnut. The palate is fairly crisp and slightly bunched up to start, until this nutty sweetness expands in the center. Ever so slightly oily. Water flattens the aromatics a bit, but allows the flavors to spread gently. All in all, a decent example of an uncommonly seen single malt. £85"
4617,"<price>80<rating>94<whiskey>Ardbeg Uigeadail, 54.2%<review>Launched in 2003, Uigeadail remains one of Ardbeg’s core offerings. Matured in a mix of sherry and bourbon barrels and bottled at cask strength. Peppery peat, warm tar, coffee grounds, machine oil, and black pepper on the nose. The palate is complex and rich, offering orange segments sprinkled with sea salt, dark chocolate, malt, and ever-present sweet peat. Nicely balanced. Lengthy in the finish, with smoky caramel."
4618,"<price>58<rating>92<whiskey>Kirkland 20 year old Sherry Cask Finish Speyside, 46%<review>No doubt about the sherry finish here: Toblerone, brown sugar, raisins, Fig Newtons, and hazelnuts on the nose, along with a hint of sulfur. The palate is oak-driven and chocolaty, with dried figs, raisins, cherries, blueberries, candied ginger, cloves, black pepper, and almonds. A supple, moreish finish with dark chocolate and lengthy polished oak. From the same undisclosed distillery as Kirkland’s 18 year old. (Costco)"
4619,"<price>220<rating>94<whiskey>Midleton Very Rare 2019, 40%<review>A classic with its nose of toffee, vanilla, treacle tarts, and fragrant pot still spices. Initially, flavors of green apple, red fruits, toffee, nimble spices, caramel, and vanilla before a minty master class: rubbed mint leaves become peppermint, developing into After Eight mints, then cool mints. Taste for a minute or more for the full experience. The smooth finish has clove, pepper, and bitter dark chocolate. Collectibles"
4620,"<price>471<rating>90<whiskey>Glenglassaugh 35 Year Old The Chosen Few, 49.6%<review>The initial release in Glenglassaugh’s new ‘The Chosen Few’ range has been picked by customer accounts manager Ronnie Routledge. It was distilled in 1976 and matured in an ex-sherry butt that yielded 654 bottles. Initially, an aroma of Black Twist tobacco and treacle, with sweeter and more floral notes following on. Significant honey influence. Mouth-coating, with sweet sherry and tropical fruits, plus developing honey and spice notes. Oak, toast, and dark chocolate in the lingering, lively finish. £300"
4621,"<price>43<rating>85<whiskey>Blackened Brandy Cask-Finished American Whiskey (Batch 082), 45%<review>A collaboration between the late Dave Pickerell and metal group Metallica, this sourced straight whiskey blend was finished in so-called “black brandy barrels” for several weeks to the sound of Metallica’s music—a method aimed at enhancing the aging process. Dusty oak, potpourri, leather, licorice, vanilla, and caramel, along with banana, raisins, and plums on the palate. Bitter chocolate and spicy heat punctuate the finish, with a light citrus note."
4622,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Rabble Rouser Bottled in Bond Rye, 50%<review>Peanut taffy, licorice, black pepper, tarragon, and lemon vie with Popsicle stick and a bit of solvent on the nose. The palate is laden with herbs—anise, licorice, tarragon, and basil—as well as cubeb, black pepper, and cough syrup. There are some enjoyable flavors here, but heavy-handed oak throws things off-balance."
4623,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>High West 21 year old Rocky Mountain Rye (Batch #2), 46%<review>Made from a mash containing 53% rye, and aged in used barrels. The relatively low rye content, along with being aged in used wood, means this is one soft, smooth rye whiskey. Gentle mint, green tea, cinnamon, nutmeg, roasted nuts, glazed fruit, and candied corn all lie on a bed of vanilla and caramel. I tasted a “work in progress” sample last year which showed more oak. This expression is much better. Not as complex or dynamic as the flagship “Rendezvous Rye” from High West, but I could drink this stuff all day long."

This 29 year old expression was matured in six oloroso sherry casks before a final period of finishing in Pedro Ximénez casks. The nose yields black currant juice spilled onto old leather, then cigar boxes along with plump sultanas soaked in sherry. Voluptuous and silky on the palate, with rich sherry, dates, walnuts, and black treacle. Tingling spices, molasses, and licorice in the lengthy, satisfying finish. (3,052 bottles)"
4625,"<price>138<rating>83<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Bunnahabhain) 23 year old 1989, 46%<review>Our second Bunna’, this is pale of hue with a surprising hint of salinity alongside a whiff of lemon sherbet, and an aroma like wet linen, while a floury maltiness runs below. Age however has twisted the fruits into the verge of musty over-ripeness. It’s explosive and spicy and, even though this is only 46%, it is hot. Water picks up the acidity before there’s a huge hit of warming ginger as the kiss-off. £89"
4626,"<price>158<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes Elders’ Reserve, 43%<review>As befits an elder of the church, this has a serious attitude, which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. Full-bodied, but with elegance, not bludgeoning power, this is a refined Rothes: malted barley, creamy oak, oxidative depths. Sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. The palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water, though I’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb.

4627,"<price>240<rating>94<whiskey>Blackadder 32 year old 1988 (Distilled at Invergordon), 51.5%<review>

An intense syrupy nose of fermenting fruit, with honey, ripe plum, grape, Braeburn apple, passion fruit, pineapple, and taffy, with flashes of cinnamon and snuff. Lush, weighty sweetness to taste, with honey, vanilla, mandarin, baked apricot, peach, molten caramel, oak, baked apple, and bananas in custard. What a find! As Blackadder celebrates 25 years in business, this will banish any doubts you have about grain whisky’s flavor. (273 bottles, 60 for U.S.)—"
4628,"<price>1250<rating>86<whiskey>Singleton of Glendullan 38 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 59.8%<review>Mature on the nose, mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. As it opens, you encounter Moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. Grows in sweetness. The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)"
4629,"<price>75<rating>87<whiskey>Remus Repeal Reserve (Series I), 47%<review>Starting with floral, fruit, and perfume notes, its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle, spice, and oak to shine through. On the palate, honey, canned peaches, tobacco, and crème brûlée lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter, icing, and a white fudge-dipped Oreo. However, bitterness sets in, causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish."
4630,"<price>40<rating>83<whiskey>Spirit of America Bourbon, 43%<review>More MGP whiskey: 2 years old, 51% corn, 45% wheat, 5% malt. That’s a lot of wheat, and you can smell it: soft, sweet, even a bit doughy, with a little mint candy. Extremely smooth, but not insipid; there’s some nice oak backbone here, a good weight, and a solid center of corn. Craftsmanlike. And $1 from every bottle goes to veterans programs. Sourced whiskey."
4631,"<price>36<rating>80<whiskey>Hirsch Small Batch Reserve, 46%<review>A balanced and well-rounded whiskey, but it tastes a little youthful and spirity on the finish, and lacks the depth I’m looking for to score it higher in the 80s. Notes of maple syrup, crème caramel, and raspberry tart, with cinnamon, vanilla, mint, and dried citrus peppered throughout. I like it, but there are better bourbons at this price.

The nose offers milk chocolate sprinkled with white pepper, sweet red wine, and ultimately, smoky citrus fruit. Big red berry notes lead on the palate, followed by ginger and spicy peat. Tangy red currants and bonfire smoke in the relatively long finish. Impressive for its age. (10,000 bottles)"
4633,"<price>805<rating>86<whiskey>John Walker & Sons Private Collection 2015 Edition, 46.8%<review>This second release celebrates Walker’s rare fruit character using 29 handpicked casks combining regional styles, aligned to the 2010 Director’s Blend. Aromas of pear and fresh apple layered over tangy, sugar-tossed dried fruits, pineapple, deep orange oils, and dry peel. Taciturn smoke. Creamy butteriness with red apple, raspberry, and sweet orange yields to soft, chewy pear skins, honey-drizzled Turkish delights, and charred paper. An outlier of JW character but important to contemplate how this adds context to the entire collection. £550"
4634,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Corsair Nashville, 50%<review>Mashbill of corn, smoked barley, rye, and wheat, and a ruddy, almost garnet color to it. Smells like barrel drool in a rickhouse; kinda raunchy and sweet, with broad notes of vanilla and hot corn. Quite a mouthful at 100 proof, and after a short initial wave of sweet, the smoke shouts through, squeezing and wringing the other flavors dry, right through the finish. Water makes it paradoxically hotter."

can suggest a single malt without a spark of wayward genius. This is,
typically, very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. As
it opens there’s dried lemon, oak, dried fig, and (dilute) pencil shavings. The
palate is—typically—sweet and thick, though here with a refreshing sharpness,
like a mix of wine gums and cider. I’d add a rock or two of ice. (Travel Retail exclusive) £38/1 liter"

Not as rich, thick, sweet, or deep as last year’s classic 25th Anniversary bottling. This one’s lighter, drier, and with more spice. Cinnamon, mint, nutmeg, licorice root, citrus, and subtle botanical notes, all wrapped up in caramel and vanilla. Dry, pleasant finish. If the 25th Anniversary bottling was an ideal digestif, this one is more suitable as an aperitif."
4638,"<price>49<rating>88<whiskey>Griffo Stony Point American Whiskey(Batch 9), 47%<review>Made with corn and rye and aged in new American and French oak barrels. It’s appetizing on the nose, with aromas of almond scone spread with orange marmalade, along with cooked pumpkin and butterscotch pudding. More orange emerges on the sweet and candied palate, as well as Big Red gum, chocolate, almonds, and sweet grain; the oak is expressive, but balanced. A clean and dry finish, with almond, milk chocolate, and cinnamon candy."
4639,"<price>107<rating>89<whiskey>Southern Coast Single Malt Cask 4, 46%<review>Southern Coast Distillers is part of a new wave of distillers in Victoria, South Australia, and unlike many fledgling distilleries who bottle too early and learn their trade in public view, with blemished, linseed-sappy malt, this distillery has hit the ground running and is already making fabulous whisky. There isn't an off note here, and it combines lemon sherbet bonbons, honeyed vanilla, bitter dark chocolate, licorice, and some pepper. Delightful. A$110"
4640,"<price>36<rating>87<whiskey>Clyde May’s Alabama Style American Whiskey, 42.5%<review>A host of sweet confections awaits in this whiskey, which appears to be Kentucky bourbon with some types of added flavoring. Big caramel gives way to angel food cake, crème brûlée, lemon chiffon, and batter. But it doesn’t stray far enough to resemble a flavored whiskey, delivering an oily texture and nice viscosity, oozing with apple, citrus, grape soda, and hints of leather. Not one for the purist, but enjoyable all the same."
4641,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection “Aged Cask” 46.2%<review>A set of two 100% rye whiskeys, triple distilled in copper pot stills, with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask, while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.
Very pale in color, showing the limited oak influence. The used cask allows the rye to shine. An uncluttered whiskey, with fresh mint, soft cinnamon, creamy vanilla, hay, cut grass, and honeyed orchard fruit (green apple, pear, peach). Grassy finish. The more elegant of the two."

This smells like nothing so much as instant oatmeal of the maple and brown sugar variety—sweet cereal, buttressed by fresh-hewn oak, orange marmalade, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. The palate does well, given a bit of water and time to open up, revealing maple syrup, almond, milk chocolate, cinnamon, orange peel, and a hint of tobacco, as well as new wood. More tobacco, like the end of a cigar, on the finish, along with milk chocolate and persistent oak."
4643,"<price>167<rating>90<whiskey>Hakushu 18 year old, 43.5%<review>Unlike their colleagues in Scotland, Japanese distillers do not exchange stock for their blending requirements. This means that each distillery is set up to produce a wide range of styles. Hakushu uses four different types of malt (unpeated to heavy) run through four pairs of differently-shaped stills. Each single malt is a different blend of these bases. While still herbal, this example shows more sherried notes along with sour orange zest, tropical fruit, and some smoke. Complex.£105"
4644,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Rabbit Hole Heigold Kentucky Straight Bourbon, 47.5%<review>Aromas of root beer, cooked cherries, candied orange, licorice, cloves, iced tea, spearmint, marshmallow Peeps, and a hint of varnish. The palate is chewy and full, with flavors tumbling over each other in a rush: orange, cinnamon, clove, licorice, horehound, oak, almonds, vanilla cream, and a bit of herbaceousness. It finishes dry, with bright fruit, cedary oak, cinnamon, and almonds."
4645,"<price>460<rating>90<whiskey>Blair Athol 23 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 58.4%<review>This Perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in European oak sherry butts. Brittle toffee, black treacle, aniseed, black pepper, and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. The bold palate yields full, creamy sherry notes, almonds, ginger, old leather, and a slightly savory tang. Long, warming, and peppery in the finish. (5,514 bottles)"
4646,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey>XXX Shine, 44.4%<review>Unaged corn whiskey from Philadelphia. The distinctive white corn spirit smell: crushed corn leaves, wet cornmeal, hint of fruit and split stone. A singular flavor, though: the usual flabby, green sweetness isn’t here. Instead, there’s a dry, solid corn flavor, something that tastes complete, arrived. I could ask for more complexity, but the focused, dry intensity of it has a singular appeal, asking only ice — or a lager chaser — to make a great afternoon.  "
4647,"<price>45<rating>82<whiskey>Ko‘olau Old Pali Road Whiskey (Batch #001), 43%<review>The nose is floral and grain-forward, with green banana, lemon pith, Honey Nut Cheerios, and wood spice. On the palate, sweet whipped cream and lemon are overlaid by white pepper and Popsicle stick. It finishes hot and dry. A blend of whiskey made from a bourbon mash by Ko‘olau Distillery and 5 year old whiskey from Missouri."
4648,"<price>55<rating>89<whiskey>Balblair 2000, 43%<review>The 2000 vintage of Balblair is intended to replace the well-regarded 1997 variant. Matured in first-fill American oak, this very drinkable expression represents good value for the money. A pretty peach and pineapple nose, with coconut and honeyed vanilla. Toasted marshmallows with time. Relatively light-bodied, sweet, with lively spice, ginger, and youthful oak on the relatively complex palate. Fudge in the finish, and a contrasting hint of dark chocolate at the last."
4649,"<price>460<rating>87<whiskey>The Antiquary 35 year old, 46%<review>The aromas can be split into four; fresh fruits (raspberry, blueberry), desserts (vanilla custard, bread and butter pudding), antique shop (polished furniture, well-oiled moving parts), and stewed fruits (apple, rhubarb, some old orange peel). Wisps of balsa wood smoke; tangy orange notes build, accompanied by those fresh fruits, sweet oak, aniseed, and white pepper ending on black treacle and gingerbread. The finish is epically long; dry, floral, with parkin, residual wood notes, and further smoke evident. (800 bottles)"
4650,"<price>39<rating>89<whiskey>Town Branch 7 year old Kentucky Single Malt, 43.5%<review>Town Branch was founded by an Irishman, Pearse Lyons, and you’d be forgiven for thinking this 100% malted barley whiskey hails from the Emerald Isle. Citrus, confectionary, and floral notes on the nose, with almond, pistachio, and some forest floor and dried leaves. In the mouth, a lively texture undergirds brown butter, mixed nuts, lemon zest, and a hint of ginger. It finishes nutty and warm, with a touch of cigar wrapper and leathery oak."
4651,"<price>44<rating>82<whiskey>Glenlivet Founder’s Reserve, 40%<review>This new NAS might surprise those who recall the Chivas Bros. “Age Matters” campaign, but that’s whisky for you. The initial impression is of a fresh maltiness, sweet hay, and fresh porridge oats, then comes sawn oak, but it opens into pineapple, becoming more obviously Glenlivet. The palate is pretty and light, but seems a bit hollow in the middle, making the whole package slightly insubstantial. Water enhances and sweetens the nose, but deepens that mid-palate hole. £30"
4652,"<price>33<rating>78<whiskey>Adirondack Distilling 1,000 Stills White Whisky, 40%<review>Buttered popcorn combines with wet pavement, vanilla, and black pepper for an interesting but edgy nose. The entry is light and sweet with vanilla and buttered corn, and a silky smooth mouthfeel. The mid-palate thins things out a bit and shifts focus to strong black pepper. This black pepper drives a spicy and dry finish. Many white whiskies straddle the line between whisky and vodka, and this one edges a little too close to the vodka space."
4653,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Cutty Sark Prohibition, 50%<review>Bold spicy nose with dark toffee and dried chili flakes. Explosive pepper notes duel with chocolate as they work through the toffee flavors and begin to show a bitter dark chocolate edge. It’s a gutsy, spirited blend with tongue-searing spices, eventually serving up more sweet notes, but consider adding water or pouring over ice to release more vanilla, fruits, and milk chocolate flavors to take the adventure further."
4654,"<price>60<rating>87<whiskey>Raasay While We Wait (2018 Release), 46%<review>The latest While We Wait bottling comprises a mix of peated and unpeated whisky from an undisclosed distillery, finished in French oak Tuscan wine casks. Fragrant on the nose, with freshly mown hay, gentle smoke, berries, honey, and hot chocolate. Apricots and red wine on the palate, with vanilla and dried fruits, against a backdrop of singed woodsmoke. Nutty and oaky in the slightly oily finish. (10,000 bottles)"
4655,"<price>13<rating>80<whiskey>Southshot, 40%<review>Hot oak and bubble gum in the nose, with a slight solvent hit of fingernail polish. Light corn in the mouth, oaky bitterness, a flash of the polish, and pretty hot for 40%. A very thin mouthfeel, not that
appealing. The nicest thing about it, though, is the finish, which is surprisingly smooth, sweet, and almost rich. You’d want to dump some cola and ice in here. Sourced whiskey."
4656,"<price>220<rating>80<whiskey>Master of Malt Speyside Single Malt 40 year old, 40%<review>A similar story to the 30 year old. Despite a truly excellent nose, this time more sherry influences dominate: think of polished wood, damsons, and a little menthol/camphor and resinous oak. Once again, the palate seems to be slightly dumber than I’d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant, complex expression. It’s balanced, just a little faded. Again, maybe higher strength might have done the trick. £140"
4657,"<price>1600<rating>91<whiskey>Benromach 1975, 49.9%<review>This vintage bottling was distilled during the 1970s and spent 41 years in a refill bourbon hogshead (#3434). Spicy on the early nose, with fresh oak. Increasingly malty, with ginger and apricot. The palate is rich and full, with Jaffa orange, stewed apples, cocoa, and pipe tobacco. Plain chocolate and increasingly tannic oak in the finish. Ultimately, warming spicy citrus fruits and smoky black pepper. (162 bottles) £1,250"
4658,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>Old Pepper Straight Rye (Barrel G18Q), 55.35%<review>A characterful, if peculiar whiskey that suggests younger rye. Horehound, citronella oil, scented geranium, and lemon balm contribute to an intensely herbal, slightly antiseptic aroma. There is a compelling bitter edge to the flavor, like biting into orange peel, while the finish is intensely woody and mouth-coating. Not for everyone, but quite captivating and flavorful."
4659,"<price>50<rating>95<whiskey>Bulleit Blenders’ Select (Batch 001), 50%<review>

Blender Eboni Major makes her mark with this limited-edition whiskey that incorporates three distillates, all at least 9 years old. The multiple flavor profiles and ages converge to create a hyper-charged bourbon with layers of flavor. A lively nose offers raspberry, chocolate, mint, confectioners’ sugar, and candied pecans. The palate is bold, with flavors of cherry, spearmint, dark chocolate, nougat, pepper, and polished oak. More mint follows on the finish, along with bitter chocolate, dark berries, and spice. Each batch will have its own profile, and this incredible inaugural effort promises more greatness to come. Number 4 in the 2020 Top 20"
4660,"<price>70<rating>92<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac, 66.2%<review>Full-throttle rye, bottled uncut and unfiltered. Bold spice notes (cinnamon, allspice, mint), lush fruit (ripe orchard fruit, golden raisin), orange liqueur, and subtle coconut, all on a bed of caramel and honeyed vanilla. Clean and uncluttered. This isn’t a one-trick pony. It’s the sweetness and fruit that accompany the rye spice that makes this whiskey so attractive."
4661,"<price>140<rating>88<whiskey>Glenrothes 1988, 43%<review>The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me, it’s at its best au naturel."
4662,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Whistling Andy Harvest Select Whiskey, 40%<review>This whiskey pours light, sweet, and pure, with fresh bread and honeyed malt up front while displaying some evident youth to the spirit. The palate offers warm cereals, floral notes, Bit-O-Honey candy, and malty sweetness on the palate. Not especially complex, but delicate, clean, and pretty."
4663,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Balblair 16 year old, 40%<review>Light to medium in body, but quite flavorful. Firm spice notes and subtle brine (both of which are often found in Northern Highland malts) makes the whisky fresh and quite lively. There’s a soothing, mouth-coating, toffee sweetness providing balance and depth. This is the first distillery bottling of Balblair available here in the U.S. in a long time, and it is very welcomed."
4664,"<price>50<rating>77<whiskey>Arran 12 year old, 46%<review>Nice to see Arran making it to 12 years old. Creamy on the palate and soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (maple and butterscotch syrup, vanilla cream) and fruit (caramel apple, fried banana). Soft, congenial finish. A low-level yet persistent nutty/burnt rubber note detracts from what would otherwise be a very fun, pleasantly sweet whisky. (Note: at the time of publication, the whisky was not yet available in the U.S. Price above is UK price, converted to dollars).
"
4665,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Old Pulteney Clipper, 46%<review>This limited-edition bottling was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It is non-chill filtered and includes no caramel coloring. Vanilla, milk chocolate, dried fruits, and green apples on the nose. Relatively light-bodied, with orange juice, honey, wood spice, and a hint of brine on the soft, oaky palate. The finish is medium in length, gently fruity, with mixed nuts and salted caramel."
4666,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>Grand MacNish Double Matured 13 year old Rum Cask Finish, 43%<review>Mango, candied orange peel, coriander seed, creamy vanilla, and exotic spices on the nose of this aged blend finished in sweet rum barrels from Trinidad, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. A bright and sunny whisky, it’s full-bodied and moreish, led by tropical fruit flavors of dried papaya, mango, melon, honey, butterscotch, and zesty orange, all framed by gentle spices. Sweet drams are made of this, who am I to disagree?"
4667,"<price>26<rating>85<whiskey>Treaty Oak The Day Drinker Texas, 40%<review>
From Texas-based Treaty Oak Distilling, distilled from corn and wheat and aged 12 months. The relatively low ABV is by design, to make this a “sessionable” whiskey. Herbal on the nose, with lots of barrel influence. Light on the palate but full in texture, with notes of maple syrup, blueberry pie, cooked peaches, and new oak, followed by a spiced finish. The overall profile is light, but with sippable flavors."
4668,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Starward Nova, 41%<review>Braided apple puff pastry, sultana, custard, a hint of blueberry, and jam slathered over warm scones, backed by hot chocolate and Christmas spices. The taste experience is surprising, as just when it draws you in with green apples and banana custard, it goes off on a tangent with mouth-drawing sour green plums, peppercorn, and candied wild strawberries, and concludes with a ground ginger and peppery finish."
4669,"<price>95<rating>85<whiskey>Springbank 10 year old, 58.7%<review>Aged in a re-charred sherry cask. Moderately rich and sweet on the nose and palate, but clean and not heavy. Light toffee, nougat, Brazil nuts, vanilla fudge, and honey-laced citrus fruit and golden raisin. Subtle brine accents throughout, with a soothing finish. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)"
4670,"<price>80<rating>86<whiskey>Tomatin 15 year old, 52%<review>The latest release from Tomatin distillery is a limited edition (3,150 bottles) 15 year old that has been matured in a combination of second-fill bourbon barrels and tempranillo wine casks (the grape of full-bodied Spanish reds like those from Rioja). The nose offers fruit cocktail and salted popcorn, while milk chocolate, vanilla, and nutty caramel notes emerge. Soft chocolate, bananas, and autumn berries on the slightly peppery palate. The finish is nutty, with lingering spice, peppery oak, and finally a lengthy, creamy sensation."
4671,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Rampur Single Malt, 43%<review>The distillery, founded in 1943, lies in Uttar Pradesh in the Himalayan foothills where they have been making whisky for 25 years. Chocolate, coffee, dried cranberry, and dark toffee notes. Across the tongue, chocolate-dipped dried fruit and citrus peel, apple, strawberry, raspberry, malt, and glimpses of cinnamon, ginger, and star anise. Great quality whisky, the flavor plateaus through to a medium-length finish of ginger with bitter cocoa notes."
4672,"<price>190<rating>96<whiskey>Rittenhouse Rye, 25 year old, (Barrel #1), 50%<review>Surprisingly lively. Very much like the 21 year old release in this regard, but not as spicy on the nose or palate. Instead, the spice is replaced by a layered, satisfying sweetness -- not by wood, like the somewhat lethargic, oak-dominated 23 year old release. Older doesn’t mean that it tastes older. Deep, nutty toffee foundation, with nougat, candied tropical fruit, and shoo-fly pie. The spices (cinnamon, spearmint, vanilla, cocoa powder) emerge mid-palate and linger, warming the finish. Not as vibrant as the 21 year old expression, but more sophisticated. I can’t speak for the other barrels in this lot, but I think this one is a great example of what a 20-plus year old rye whiskey should taste like."
4673,"<price>28<rating>86<whiskey>Glen Fohdry Dublaich Speyside, 47.1%<review>Earthy and a bit saline on the nose, like a pine forest in spitting distance of the sea. The palate shows a bit of youthful heat, as well as grilled fruit, polished oak, walnuts, and a somewhat soapy character. The finish is nutty and chocolaty, with structured oak. (Total Wine & More)"
4674,"<price>28<rating>87<whiskey>Four Roses Single Barrel (Barrel #55-6F), 50%<review>A lively bourbon, with bright fruit, honeyed vanilla, and fragrant floral notes. Lean on the palate, with a firm, dry, spicy finish. A youthful whiskey that skips along until the finish. It doesn’t have the thicker, sweeter mid-palate like Barrel#87-6L reviewed here. As a result, its finish is firm, and crisply dry. (Bottled exclusively for The Party Source.) 
"
4675,"<price>1500<rating>96<whiskey>The Dalmore 50 year old, 52.8%<review>The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue), with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout, along with vanilla cream, an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen), juicy oak, forest bedding, rancio, old armagnac, polished leather, tobacco, maple syrup, dark chocolate, almond macaroon, and subtle espresso. Long, mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml.)"
4676,"<price>210<rating>88<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Linlithgow), 1975 Vintage, 46%<review>One of the better bottlings from this Lowland distillery which closed in 1983. Velvety and slightly oily in texture, and fragrant. The whisky is balanced, the flavors clean, with no hint of excessive oak. Bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer, along with coconut cream, honey, and a touch of caramel. Bright fruit (lemon meringue, pineapple, apricot) keeps the whisky lively, and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. Nutty, toasted oak finish. If you are looking for a Linlithgow (AKA St. Magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find, I can recommend this one. 
"
4677,"<price>30<rating>79<whiskey>Dad’s Hat Pennsylvania White Rye, 50%<review>There’s the sweet reek of new make: barely ripe apricot and peach, green grain, a hint of spice. The spirit is surprisingly dry, with shots of grain, pepper, and some clean alcohol notes on the top, but a well-mannered 100 proof indeed, and easy to hold on the tongue. There’s a dry twist of anise on the finish. An interesting — and promising — white whiskey. (Pennsylvania only.)"
4678,"<price>60<rating>88<whiskey>Balcones Brimstone, 53%<review>Distilled from roasted blue corn. The spirit itself, not the grain, is smoked over Texas scrub oak. Spicy Red Vines, herbal notes, and blackened corn aromas. An initial burst of fire on the palate transforms into juicy red fruit, sweet cinnamon apple, and hints of bramble and forest floor. An unusual and polarizing whiskey, Brimstone is aggressive at first, but in the end it’s a gentle giant."
4679,"<price>12<rating>77<whiskey>Black Eagle Honey, 35%<review>Odd aroma, more like a weedy, aromatic bark than honey; wonder what the bees were gathering from? Very sweet, on the rich and cloying side, but without the real honey character that makes Jack Daniel’s Honey the best of this bunch, and I can’t get over the aroma. The only saving grace is that even at 35%, the bourbon still manages to peek through; it’s not enough."
4680,"<price>39<rating>87<whiskey>Rod & Hammer’s SLO Stills Straight Rye, 45%<review>Lovely, perfumy, fragrant nose: orange and peach blossoms, tea rose, lilacs, apricot jam, and blueberry muffins. It remains floral and sweet on the palate, but with a solid oak backbone surrounded by red berries, orange sherbet, ginger, baking spice, and a fizzy zing that finishes sweet and light, sprinkled with pepper and drizzled with Hershey’s chocolate syrup. (1,000 bottles)"
4681,"<price>225<rating>97<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blue Label, 40%<review>Magnificently powerful and intense. Caramels, dried peats, elegant cigar smoke, seeds scraped from vanilla beans, brand new pencils, peppercorn, coriander seeds, and star anise make for a deeply satisfying nosing experience. Silky caramels, bountiful fruits of ripe peach, stewed apple, orange pith, and pervasive smoke with elements of burnt tobacco. An abiding finish of smoke, dry spices, and banoffee pie sweetness. Close to perfection. Editor's Choice"
4682,"<price>178<rating>85<whiskey>Master of Malt Reference Series III, 47.5%<review>With the majority of the blend coming from older single malts, this forms a counterpoint to I and II (see below). Toasted spices, fennel, black peppercorns, cocoa, malt loaf, split orange peels, and salted caramel invade the nose. The palate is a gluttony of chocolate. Beneath, look for dried fruits, macchiato, peanut shells, and some tannic bitterness as the older malts show their wares. It leaves a cocoa finish without the sweetness. A great concept for self-educating your palate. £106"
4683,"<price>30<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig Straight Rye, 47%<review>

Elijah Craig always impresses with value, but until now has been confined to bourbon. This foray into rye whiskey sticks close to Elijah Craig’s bourbon roots by using only the minimum-required 51% rye in its formulation; however, it does achieve a nice departure in flavor. Aromas include butterscotch, caramel-nut clusters, and peppery spice. The spice ramps up on the palate, carried forward by the full body, hearty proof, and mouth-coating texture, as cherry cola, baking chocolate, and darker fruits emerge. Priced a notch below comparable peers, this rye delivers powerful flavors that feel excitingly untamed, and will impress bourbon and rye lovers alike. Number 7 in the 2020 Top 20"
4684,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Malt Whisky, 18 year old, 43%<review>Similar in profile to the 12 year old expression below, except that the bouquet is thicker, the sweetness is more caramelized, and the fruit notes are drier (no surprises). There’s also more depth and maturity in this whisky, more oak spice, and a longer, drier finish. An excellent value! 
"
4685,"<price>39<rating>87<whiskey>Hye-Land 12 year old Small Batch Armenian Whisky, 43%<review>Hye-Land’s inaugural U.S. release, made from 100% malted wheat at Eraskh Winery in Armenia (which also has a distillery), aged in Caucasus Mountain oak barrels, and then finished in Armenian brandy barrels. The nose offers seasoned oak, citrus, ginger, and allspice. The palate brings sweet notes of melon, coconut shavings, tobacco, Christmas cake, ginger, and clove, all lightly accented by black pepper. The finish is viscous and has balanced sweetness."
4686,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Knappogue Castle Twin Wood 17 year old 1994 Vinatge, 40%<review>Finished in sherry casks, which contribute lush red berried fruit, strawberry/rhubarb crumb pie, and candied ginger on top of honeyed malt, vanilla wafer, nougat, and warming spice. Oily texture, with resinous oak on the finish. Good balance with plenty of character. After years of younger Knappogue releases, I’ve really been enjoying the more recent older bottlings like this one. (Allocated mostly to the U.S.)"
4687,"<price>123<rating>89<whiskey>Glenrothes 1995 American Oak, 45%<review>The initial Glenrothes 1995 was released in 2011. This edition comprises first-fill American oak casks seasoned with dry oloroso sherry. Significant sherry cask influence early on the nose, with a savory note, rich fruitcake, cherries, malt, and developing vanilla custard. Supple in the mouth, with honey, berry fruits, and citrus notes. Spicier in time. The finish dries slightly, with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper."
4688,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Tincup Straight Rye, 45%<review>Dark berries, cola, iced tea, dark chocolate, toasted oak, white pepper, and lime on the nose, permeated by an earthy character. Strong oak on the palate is kept in check by spice—ginger, cinnamon, pepper—and dark fruit, with notes of black tea and roasted peanuts as well. The finish is nutty and quite spiced, with lingering blackberries and a touch of bitter oak."
4689,"<price>2525<rating>95<whiskey>Glenglassaugh, 40 year old, 44.6%<review>An excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky, you know it’s old, but you also know it’s very good. "
4690,"<price>70<rating>89<whiskey>Four Roses Mariage Collection (2008 Release), 55.7%<review>Silky in texture and gently sweet. This new “Mariage Collection” release shows a softer, more elegant side of Four Roses when compared to their other bottlings (including the most recent limited edition 120th Anniversary bottling, which was a much bolder affair). Notes of candied fruit, black raspberry, blueberry, creamy vanilla, cornbread, and chamomile tea. Delicately spicy too, with a polished oak finish. Clean on the palate and very drinkable. Four Roses utilizes a wide variety of mash bills and yeast strains, and has the ability to produce a diverse array of whiskeys. This “Mariage” offering is a good example.
"
4691,"<price>625<rating>89<whiskey>Oban 21 year old, 58.5%<review>The first Diageo Special Releases Oban to be released since 2004 has been matured in rejuvenated American oak and second-fill bodega casks. The outturn is 2,860 bottles. Tinned peaches, ginger, caramel, and newly-sawn wood on the nose, with an accompanying marine note. Syrupy in the mouth, very sweet and spicy, with nutmeg, cinnamon, and baked apple. Contrast is provided by a splash of brine. Spicy in the drying finish, with ginger to the fore, plus more sea salt."
4692,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Cask & Thistle (distilled at Imperial), 28 year old, 1975 vintage, 46%<review>An interesting comparison to the Mackillop’s Choice expression reviewed above. This is also a big, bold whisky from the currently mothballed Imperial distillery. This one is less fruity. Instead it is quite sweet with a ripe maltiness up front-and rather viscous in texture-becoming dry, slightly austere, and spicy on the finish, with a wisp of smoke. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.) 
"
4693,"<price>460<rating>95<whiskey>Glenfarclas 40 year old, 46%<review>Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions, in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It’s complex and well-rounded, with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush, candied citrus (especially orange), old pot still rum, maple syrup, fig, roasted nuts, and polished leather, with hints of mocha, candied ginger, and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic, well-matured Glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)"

This is new white spirit made with 100 percent rye and bottled at 40%. It's more pastis than whiskey, a soft licorice and aniseed alcopop which is way too drinkable. A rising star. $AUS 99/500ml"
4695,"<price>55<rating>94<whiskey>Eagle Rare 17 year old, 45%<review>While labeled as a 17 year old, it’s actually 19, distilled way back in 1988. Each year’s release of this whiskey just seems to get better and better. Some of the earlier vintages turned slightly oaky and dry for balance (the 10 year old Single Barrel Eagle Rare whiskeys did too a while back), but Buffalo Trace just keeps on improving the line. Tight, well-balanced notes of molasses, vanilla, candied fruit, and sweet corn, peppered with crisp mint, cinnamon, and polished leather. Eagle Rare 17 is evolving into a whiskey of classic proportion.

4696,"<price>85<rating>89<whiskey>The Akkeshi Sarorunkamuy, 55%<review>
The Hokkaido Akkeshi Distillery started in 2016, and with access to local peat, it has designs on a distinctive Islay style. This high-strength expression is lightly peated and shows molten caramel, crushed spices, campfire smoke, dried coconut strips, peppercorn, and rice cakes. Toffee, cooked apple, and marmalade on first sip, it’s tangy with mango, canned peaches, dried papaya, and a streak of clove and pepper."
4697,"<price>2000<rating>93<whiskey>Mortlach 26 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 53.3%<review>Aged in newly toasted first-fill Pedro Ximénez and oloroso sherry-seasoned casks, this veteran ‘beast of Dufftown’ makes a big impression. Sweet, with smoky sherry, fragrant pipe tobacco, old leather, walnuts, vanilla, and ripe cherries. The oily palate yields more leather, blackcurrant cough drops, nutmeg, cloves, Jaffa oranges, and black tea. Raisins, licorice, and oak tannins, before sweeter chocolate in the very long finish (3,883 bottles; 276 for the U.S.)"
4698,"<price>147<rating>93<whiskey>Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2019), 56.5%<review>Matured in refill American oak casks. Brine, sea breezes, woodsmoke, green apples, and ginger on the nose, plus buttery smoked haddock. Sweet and supple on the palate, with cigar, citrus fruit, and spicy peat notes developing. Scorched saucepans, licorice, lemon juice, and black pepper in the finish. £110"
4699,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Aberlour A’bunadh Alba Cask Strength (Batch #001), 57.1%<review>Sweet and clean, with aromas of honeysuckle, confectioners’ sugar, lemon, fresh jasmine, nougat, and coconut cream. The palate is remarkably consistent, with lemon curd, toasted coconut sprinkled over oatmeal, vanilla cookie, pear, and juicy citrus. A lengthy finish of grapefruit, lemon, and apple continues the theme. The clean, spirit-driven profile might give the impression of simplicity, but the high ABV ensures there is much to unpack. (Individual reviewer rating: 92)"
4700,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Juveniles, 46%<review>A blend of four single malts for the latest incarnation, this has poached pear, sweet green apple, melon skins, light spices, barley sugar, and yet some crunchy barley notes too. Sweet vanilla fattens out to orange, peppercorn, honey, and barley sugar, with apple and herbal greenery appearing at the end. Hold for at least 30 seconds, then there’s spice at the swallow, and a waxy, mouth-coating finish of smooth-pulped fruits. (14,894 bottles)"
4701,"<price>74<rating>89<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Malt #2 (batch 1), 48.3%<review>These Boutique-y blends are delivering terrifically good whiskies time after time, but the small batches sell through quickly now that the word is out. This one has plums, apple, mixed peel, spices, walnut, and sherry notes. The palate is fizzy, with plummy depths, chocolate shavings, ginger biscuits, and dark fruits with a medium-weight mouthfeel. This can go toe-to-toe with the best of ‘em. Once the ginger settles down it leaves a pleasing, mild maltiness. Add water if you must. (370 bottles) £49"
4702,"<price>3000<rating>85<whiskey>Lagavulin 37 year old, 51%<review>This is a venerable Lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse, sandalwood, and a minty lift. In time, there’s bog myrtle, old attics, rain-moistened wool, and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. Slightly dull to start, it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine, and a Darjeeling-like grippiness. Interesting for sure, but past its best. (1,868 bottles)."
4703,"<price>56<rating>82<whiskey>Glencadam The Rather Refined Port Wood Finish 12 year old, 46%<review>This Glencadam variant has been finished for 20 months in ruby port pipes. The result is a whisky that departs from its younger stablemate by offering a nose of rose petals, milk chocolate, stewed rhubarb, sweet red wine, and black pepper. The same ‘new paper’ note survives, however. Viscous on the palate; initially strawberries, then spicy milk chocolate, caramel, and candied cherries. Remaining sweet in the finish, with nutmeg and darker chocolate notes. £35"
4704,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Dalmore Port Wood Reserve, 46.5%<review>This was initially matured in American white oak barrels before spending an unspecified finishing period in port pipes. The nose is soft and fragrant, with vanilla, red berries, toffee, and ultimately, damsons. Viscous on the palate, with blackcurrants, plums, port wine, and cinnamon. Lively spices, coffee grounds, Seville orange, and dry oak in the finish."
4705,"<price>200<rating>90<whiskey>Highland Park Thor 16 year old, 52.1%<review>Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger, sherry, Christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. Long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat."
4706,"<price>40<rating>87<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Black Label Triple Cask Edition, 40%<review>This lighter, fruity, spicy whisky is not for peat lovers. Bourbon, whisky, and rum casks were used for finishing, resulting in a nose of rich honey, golden syrup, peach stone, apricot, honeydew, coriander seed, ginger, and white pepper. Citrus, butter fudge, dried and tropical fruits, rumbling spices, and tangy orange create a creamy combination, from which a familiar Johnnie Walker identity suddenly snaps into place. (Travel Retail exclusive)"
4707,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Classic Malt, 45.2%<review>Two malts: same distillation run, same proof, but this one was aged in used bourbon barrels. The color is much lighter than the new barrel bottling (also reviewed this issue), a pale straw. Nose is delicate, notes of haymow planks, clover honey, fresh grain, and sweet orange peel. Somewhat pedestrian on the palate: sweet malt, dried hay, more citrus, and a touch of pepper, with a somewhat bitter finish. No real flaws, but no excitement either. Disappointing."
4708,"<price>74<rating>88<whiskey>Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Cask Strength, 56.4%<review>This is 3 years old, Indiana distilled, and has a “ladle” of Maryland spring water added. It includes two rye mashbills—one high, one low—breaking the mold from similar Indiana-distilled ryes. For its youth and strength, it immediately and amazingly feels mature, showing rich caramel, spearmint, and earth. The momentum slows with subtle blueberry rye muffin, black pepper, and cardamom. It finishes medium with a hint of cornbread."
4709,"<price>80<rating>87<whiskey>Edradour Caledonia, 12 year old, 46%, <review>A release chosen by Douglas Maclean (and named after his song “Caledonia”). Full sherry impact, but contained—not excessive or sappy. Rich, with nutty toffee, pot still rum, a variety of raisins (regular and golden), date, honeyed fruit, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco. Good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. The flavors are nicely integrated. "
4710,"<price>65<rating>81<whiskey>Caol Ila, 18 year old, 43%<review>This Caol Ila was released the same time as the 12 year old, reviewed above. Older isn't always better, especially with Islay whiskies. I felt that way when comparing Ardbeg 17 to Ardbeg 10 year old, and I feel the same with these two Caol Ila whiskies. This 18 year old has the same flavor profile as the 12 year old. It's a well-rounded dram too, but it has lost the vibrancy and dynamic intensity of the 12 year old. If you want to experience Caol Ila in its entire youthful splendor-and save a few bucks while you're at it-then buy the 12 year old."
4711,"<price>94<rating>92<whiskey>Bushmills Distillery Exclusive Acacia Wood, 47%<review>Ireland’s technical regulations provide flexibility with the type of wood used for aging, hence this seriously aromatic whiskey with piquant citrus, lemon, fresh ginger root, sponge cake, apple peel, sour cherry, and dry spices of pepper, cumin, and whole nutmeg. Delicious citrus peel, rich honey, vanilla pod, ground ginger, banana, and grapefruit, but no matter how hard it tries, it keeps shifting back to the spices. More experiments with these barrels, please! (12,000 bottles) £74"
4712,"<price>38<rating>78<whiskey>Jameson Lively, 40%<review>Explore the grain side of Jameson’s personality in this first specimen from the Deconstructed series. Expect floral aromatics and a mixed crate of fresh citrus fruit, so it smells closer to the airport’s perfume counter than the whiskey store. Strands of honey, squeezed citrus, and vanilla blossom amid a thickening mouthfeel after a feather-light beginning. It’s tooth-achingly sweet, but daubed with lime and sweet clementine, leading to a dry, warm finish with chalky candy. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
4713,"<price>55<rating>80<whiskey>Tormore 14 year old, 43%<review>Light amber. The nose offers up walnut bread, spelt flour, and a green, malty note. Overall, it’s slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. It’s the thing about Tormore; it just can’t let itself go. (France only) €42"
4714,"<price>100<rating>82<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Rosebank), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, Cask # 1509, 56.6%<review>The distillery closed in 1993. Very fragrant, with a potpourri of dried spice, herbs, and (to a lesser degree) flowers on the nose and palate. The spices are accentuated by mint tea, fennel, clove, and faint vegetal notes. Dry, spicy finish. Not an elegant Rosebank, but rather, this is Rosebank with an attitude. 
"
4715,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Jameson Caskmates Great Divide Brewing Co. Edition, 40%<review>The association with this Denver brewery has produced a whisky redolent of crabapple, tinned peach, leather bootstraps, vanilla pod, roasted malt, and spices left to blacken in the pan. This is a scrumptious whisky layered with mixed citrus, honey, shortbread, and lashings of vanilla creaminess. The clove, ground ginger, and black pepper lay down a solid foundation, superimposed with oak char and black coffee grounds in the latter stages."
4716,"<price>176<rating>88<whiskey>Samaroli by Samaroli 2017 Edition, 43%<review>A smart little 8 year old blended malt with notes of light vanilla, hay bales, fresh flowers, and orange-flavored candies. Light, clean, and easy to like. The palate majors in orange flavors, first orange juice, with crunchy biscuit, gingerbread, and fizzy sherbet in the middle. It’s packed with flavor and depth, and ends with orange lollipops. The tanginess ricochets around the mouth, leaving a deep glow of citrus."
4717,"<price>104<rating>87<whiskey>St. George's Founder's Reserve Cask 0005, 46%<review>You'll struggle to find this, as it has been snapped up quickly, but if you can, don't miss out. This whisky was originally made by Iain Henderson, is bottled at 5 years old, and marks a significant step forward for this fledgling distillery. The sappy notes have retreated and are being replaced by a wonderful sweet lemon and creamy vanilla whisky. The pinprick pepper adds a delightful dimension. £65 "
4718,"<price>220<rating>94<whiskey>Mars Komagatake Limited Edition (2020 Release), 50%<review>
Prunes, forest honey, vanilla seeds, dark chocolate cookies, and Brazil nut, with hints of chocolate orange and ground pepper: I’m hooked. Cocoa, Whoppers, baked orange, jellied peel, jumpy peppery spices, tamarind bark, and milk chocolate pralines on the palate, and chocolate, stewed fruits, and walnut once the strength dies down. This is the complete package, and a prime contender as one of the year’s tastiest new Japanese whiskies."
4719,"<price>80<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Linkwood) 15 year old, 43%<review>A catch-up rather than a new release, but a fascinating contrast to the 14 year old Flora & Fauna bottling. Yes, there’s apple blossom, but here there’s more medlar, fruit syrups, raspberry, and an intriguing play between vanilla and lightly oxidized nuttiness. Linkwood’s substance is shown on the palate, where an oily feel adds texture to the lush dried fruits and saffron-led spiciness. Best neat. An elegant dram.  "
4720,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Low Gap 2 year old Rye, 44.1%<review>A malted rye whiskey, aged in new, bourbon, and Germain-Robin cognac barrels. Cereal grains are the star of this nose, which supports the rye grain with oak and cinnamon spice. The palate follows the grain-focused nose and is a carefully crafted love note to rye grain, featuring multi-grain cereal, cinnamon, ginger, sawdust, and a touch of oak. The finish is all dark chocolate, rye grain, and cinnamon spice; a delicious, close to expertly-crafted whiskey."
4721,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Balcones Rum Cask-Finished Texas (Batch R20-1), 62%<review>
Don’t try to be macho and slug this without water; you’ll miss out on its best characteristics. Totally neat, it’s quite good, but constrained by the numbing alcohol. Add some water and unlock flavors that continue to develop: tropical fruit, cinnamon stick, dark chocolate, and caramel on the nose, and more fruit, nuts, eucalyptus, and bitter herbs on the palate. It has a juicy, mouthwatering character with water, capped off by the well-integrated finish of charred oak, roasted pineapple, eucalyptus, and coffee beans."
4722,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Bulleit 12 year old Straight Rye, 46%<review>Time in the barrel is apparent here, with ample cedar, sawdust, and toasty oak sprinkled across caramel sweetness with a medley of herbal flavors, including licorice and basil. Generous on the palate, it serves up lots of clove and baking spices before the oak tannin sweeps in, leaving a very dry finish of bitter orange pith."
4723,"<price>95<rating>92<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Rye (cask 56), 60.2%<review>Stalk & Barrel cask strength 100% rye whisky takes rye into innovative new flavor territory. Rye spices, rose water, vanilla, earthy tones, and dark rye bread on first nosing are all typical of rye. However, once it broadens into linen, oilcloth, linseed oil, high fruity esters, malt, and breakfast cereal (Weetabix?) it’s all wonderfully original. A real honey barrel. Dang!"
4724,"<price>1500<rating>85<whiskey>Bowmore 1964 Vintage Bourbon Cask, 43%<review>Amber color. Complex, exotic aromas of vanilla fudge, coconut, white chocolate, plum, cherry, citrus, and a hint of smoke and bourbon. Light to medium in body and delicate. On the palate, there’s a brief encounter of caramel and fruits mentioned above. After that, most of the flavors come from the wood-dry vanilla, mint, layered spicy oak notes, with some smoke emerging from time to time. Dry, oaky finish. I am in love with the aroma-it’s so exotic and intriguing. I would pay just to smell this whisky. But the flavors on the palate are less exotic and more influenced by the wood."
4725,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Edradour 10 year old, 40%<review>Edradour, in Perthshire, is owned by independent bottler Signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish. "
4726,"<price>250<rating>89<whiskey>Paul John Kanya, 50%<review>magine there’s a janitor sweeping up the bisected fruit fallen from that fruit-slicing app: cherries, cooked peach, lingonberry, orange peel, fresh apple, fruit syrup, waxy leaves, and taffy chews. Plump mouthfeel with sweet baked fruits, it’s sticky and concentrated with a fabulous fruitiness at this strength. Sugared apple, baked orange, tart plum, clove, and aniseed. Unpeated and matured for around 7 years. A lot of buck for the bang. (1,500 bottles)"
4727,"<price>1100<rating>92<whiskey>Bruichladdich 1985, 48.7%<review>Originally filled into 22 third-fill bourbon casks, this 32 year old was re-casked into first-fill bourbon barrels in 2012, then finished in French oak wine barrels. Fresh peaches on the nose, with vanilla fudge, honey, and ginger. Fruity and spicy on the luscious palate, with orange, cinnamon, and coconut. Long in the finish, with ever-present fruitiness, plus prickly chili notes. (4,200 bottles)"
4728,"<price>210<rating>81<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Clynelish), 1976 Vintage, 46%<review>Thick in texture and palate-coating. Ripe peaches and bananas, orange chocolate, English toffee, and a hint of damp oak on the nose. I can also detect brine, seaweed, peat smoke, and spice, but it’s a little clumsy. Same story on the palate. Not a bad whisky, but I expect more from Clynelish. 
"
4729,"<price>117<rating>88<whiskey>Kilchoman Fèis Ìle 2016 bottling (distilled 2007), 56.6%<review>A single oloroso cask bottling, so an interesting comparison with the Loch Gorm (see below). The cask has more of an influence here, with plummy fruits, fig rolls, and Medjool dates. The smoke is restrained and foggy, allowing some seashore breezes to come through. The palate reverses this, with the smoke rolling in first, then the soft dark and sweet fruits, treacle, and garam masala. Tannins are very soft. Kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90"
4730,"<price>30<rating>89<whiskey>Riverset Straight Rye, 48.5%<review>Made at B.R. Distilling Co. in Memphis, this rye has a fragrant nose of dried herbs and a subtle scent of lemon grove, tempered by an earthy minerality. Light and dry on the palate, with flavors of cracked pepper, aged herbs, and tilled earth, set against rich, sweet undernotes of cinnamon baked apple, blackberry tart, honeysuckle, and vanilla. The finish is smooth, malty, and fruity, with balanced sweetness and earthiness. (4,000 bottles)"
4731,"<price>135<rating>88<whiskey>Murray McDavid 1996 Loch Lomond 19 year old, 46%<review>Selected from one of Scotland’s most fascinating distilleries and finished in fresh bourbon casks from Chicago’s Koval Distillery, the nose has light lemon, white pepper, mixed citrus, green melon, green chili, and floral notes. Soft pulpy melon, green fruits, poached pear, hints of citrus, then a wave of brown sugar and caramel sweetness melts into buttery fudge, with a late burst of cloves, peppercorn, and toasted hazelnut. (635 bottles for U.S.)"
4732,"<price>106<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) 42 year old, 47.7%<review>Rich notes of baking chocolate, compacted dry earth, runny caramel, and garam masala highlight the versatility of aromas between these expressions. Chocolate digestive biscuits, plain chocolate nibs, caramel, a hit of mouth-puckering pepper and chili heat, but the chocolate endures. A zinging finish akin to Tache spiced bark."
4733,"<price>78<rating>81<whiskey>Singleton of Dufftown Reserve Collection Trinité, 40%<review>Full-bodied and sweet on the nose, mixing burlap, bran, fruit cake, hazelnut purée, malt
extract; with water it becomes fresher and almond-like with a touch of
greengage plum. The palate has a soft feel, with the thickness displayed in the
nose alongside plums and crystallized ginger. It’s just a little flabby. I’d
like a bit more freshness or grip. The finish is nutty and rich. (Travel Retail exclusive) £51/1 liter "
4734,"<price>6250<rating>96<whiskey>Gold Bowmore 1964 vintage, 42.4% <review>Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine, sultana, pink grapefruit, papaya, and the general overall citrus DNA that you’ll find in old Bowmores), with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore, this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate, which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey, coating vanilla, and lively fruit, then turning quite visceral, with juicy oak, damp earth, deep peat smoke, and charcoal, followed by another wave of fruit (this time, dried fruit), finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore, and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97), because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate."
4735,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Anchor Bay, 40%<review>Lombard’s blend of Speyside malts pleases with an agreeable nose of orchard blossoms, flower honey, caramel, dry hay, and pears baked in brown granulated sugar. It’s homey and comforting, favoring its floral and fruity side. This is a light, sweet whisky that sweeps around the mouth, radiating maltiness, apple, grapefruit, dried mango strips, and mingling spices. A studiously long finish of sucked caramel candy and beeswax follows. A smart choice for the beginning of the evening. £30"
4736,"<price>41<rating>88<whiskey>Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Sherry Cask Matured, 44.2%<review>This is rich in cask characters, with baked orange, pronounced nutmeg notes, mace, peppercorn, and petrichor. The opening flavors of dark orange and syrupy caramel swerve headlong into pepper, root ginger, allspice, and nippy clove. Despite appearances, this is not awash with sherry-dominated fruitiness, but the finish is long, with spice-led dried fruits. £32"
4737,"<price>124<rating>88<whiskey>Glenturret Fly’s 16 Masters Edition,  44%<review>This limited edition 16 year old release is named after a collie dog that belonged to a distillery manager pictured in a 1905 photograph of Glenturret staff. Malt and milk chocolate, dried apricots, and subtle spice on the floral nose, with a hint of worn leather and, ultimately, ripe pears. Supple and rounded on the palate, with sweet spices, honey, black pepper, dark fruit, and coffee notes. Finally, bitter orange and plain chocolate in the medium-length finish. (1,740 bottles) £95"
4738,"<price>17<rating>73<whiskey>Spicebox Cinnamon Whisky Lot 1642, 33%<review>Cinnamon hearts. Very sweet and crazy hot with cinnamon. The cinnamon so dominates this liqueur-like drink that very little whisky manages to peek through until the very end of a long, murderously hot finish. Even then, cinnamon overrides the whiskyness, leaving a drink rather than a dram. Fun, yes, great fun, and almost certainly a bracing shooter, but it may be difficult to convince the whisky aficionado to think of this as whisky."
4739,"<price>90<rating>89<whiskey>Widow Jane 13 year old Lucky Thirteen Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 2007), 49.5%<review>French burnt peanuts, caramel, warming spice, citrus, and lots of varnish and solvent suggest some age here. However, the palate never lacks for verve, with juicy citrus drive including a bright key lime note, grapefruit, and some melon fruit that picks up more varnish and adhesive tape on the long finish."
4740,"<price>160<rating>92<whiskey>Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Rye 2018 (Barrel #18E560), 46.4%<review>This smells of rich toffee and caramel draped over leathery oak, and warm apples, with a touch of paraffin that evokes age. The body is quite generous—full and creamy—as flavors of maple candy and chocolate-covered cherry are nicely punctuated with red-pepper spice. Dense fudge-like flavors and lively citrus oils lead to a finish of black pepper and baking spices."
4741,"<price>47<rating>78<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection, Cabernet Franc aged after 8 years, 16 year old, 45%<review>Antique amber. Deeper, brooding, and less sweet than the 14 year old bottling. Distinct notes of leather, roasted nuts, and hints of tobacco on the nose and palate, along with some of the flavors of its younger sibling. It works on the nose, but the tannins (both from the wine and oak) impart a leather component that just dominates the palate. (I am seeing a pattern here with these younger vs. older whiskeys in the Experimental Collection series. The younger expressions have generally been pretty good, while most of the older ones have been aged too long.) 
"
4742,"<price>27<rating>84<whiskey>The Antiquary 12 year old, 40%<review>Thick, viscous golden syrup, digestive biscuits, and Almond Joy bars underpin some soft, peaty aromas. It’s rather an appealing combination. Satin smooth on the tongue, with lemon, lime, orange, and dried pineapple, but enough malt to keep things interesting. The finish riffs on a ripe lemon theme accompanied by spicy stardust. For the few extra bucks, the more mature component whiskies make for a richer, fuller, and more satisfying experience than The Antiquary’s red-labeled bottle."
4743,"<price>150<rating>90<whiskey>Delilah's '15', 15 year old, 50%<review>Well matured, but still with a spicy rye mean streak. There’s a lush sweetness that tames both the resinous oak and the bold rye spice…it’s a harmonious balance between the three, actually. Warming cinnamon and cool mint meld with sweet corn, rhum agricole, honey-kissed citrus, pecan pie, and cocoa powder, leading to a long, dry, spicy, leather-tinged finish. Bottled to celebrate the 15th Anniversary of Delilah’s bar in Chicago. A worthy effort!"
4744,"<price>80<rating>88<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange Elements of Islay Kh1 (distilled at Kilchoman), 59.7%<review>You’d hardy expect Kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings, but somehow TWE’s Sukhinder Singh has persuaded Anthony Wills to part with one of his precious babies. It exhibits classic Kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop, backed with subtle peat, chamomile, and lint. With water, a typically young, peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). It shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)"
4745,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Lucky Seven 6 year old The Jokester Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch 01), 47.5%<review>The nose offers notes of leather, oak, chocolate, blackberry, and baking spice. The mouthfeel is smooth, but with heat and power, as well as rich flavors of honey, cinnamon, blackberry tart, bitter chocolate, roasted peanuts, and leather. On the finish come playful flavors of baking spice, cherry tart, more blackberry, tobacco, and white pepper. An excellent blend of spice and chocolate with playful berry notes—rich, powerful, and delicate all at once. (2,500 bottles)"
4746,"<price>18<rating>85<whiskey>James Brookes Blended Whisky, 40%<review>This is like listening to a quiet and understated musician and slowly starting to realize that there are all sorts of clever
nuances just beneath the surface. This evolves from a floral and welcoming nose, through a saline note and on to pepper and a Highland earthiness, but wrapped up in a rich, honeyed body. A nice balance between the ruggedness and sweet softness. All rather pleasant."
4747,"<price>133<rating>89<whiskey>Braunstein Library Collection 11-2, 46%<review>Gently peated malt was distilled and matured in bourbon and new American oak casks by Claus and Michael Braunstein. A refined nose of smoked duck terrine, with fudge, gentle vanilla, and lime zest underneath. Rather elegant, with a note-perfect balance between the smoke and the sweetness. There’s a huge explosion of mandarin, Milka chocolate, sharp citrus, espresso, treacle, licorice, and dry, wrinkly dates. The finish of rich, black coffee is smooth, sultry, and long. 795kr"
4748,"<price>150<rating>79<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Banff), 28 year old, 1976 vintage, 43%<review>Dominant notes of citrus (lemon, lime) and other tropical fruits (coconut, mango) on the nose. On the palate, the whisky is simple and uncomplicated. The entry is soft and malty, and then it becomes dry and gently oaky. Not overly inspiring, but those who purchase the whisky for its rarity value (the distillery closed in 1983), shouldn’t be discouraged from actually drinking the stuff some day. 
"
4749,"<price>180<rating>96<whiskey>Redbreast 21 year old, 46%<review>Wow! After the wonderful 12 year old cask strength, Redbreast does it again. This is a different beast altogether, but it is a stunner. This is Roger Waters doing The Wall: over the top, unsubtle, and totally entertaining. There’s lots going on: fermenting apples, juicy oils, spice, and dark cherry and berry fruits zip and fizz over the palate, the wood influence is sublime. I'm comfortably numb."
4750,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Experimental OO-V4, 43%<review>Great King Street was our Blend of the Year two years ago and Compass Box wondered where to take it next. So they have released two versions, asking customers to decide between them by voting online. The other one is peated and will probably win easily, which is a shame, because this is a more subtle and better whisky. Sherry, syrup, honey, apple, and sultanas are all here, but nuanced. Delightful. £30"
4751,"<price>25<rating>86<whiskey>Old Camp Wolf Moon Straight Bourbon, 40%<review>Licorice, black tea, lemon, green apple, pomegranate, and almond on the nose. The palate is fruity, smooth, and light up front, with notes of dried orange slices, orange Creamsicle, lemon curd, and accents of nuttiness. The finish offers more orange, as well as flavors of vanilla cream and sweet raspberry, all spiced with an overlay of white pepper. Wispy and lacking deep complexity, but with balanced sweetness and some very pleasant notes."
4752,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Backbone Bourbon Uncut (batch 13), 56.5%<review>Right up front, there’s really rich caramel with a lovely vanilla undertone. Then fruit, and lots of it: blackberries, blueberries, baked apples, and canned peaches, followed by wood, nutmeg, and maple syrup. It’s borderline complex, with a seamless balance and transition to the flavors. Extraordinarily rich caramel reappears over a medium, buttery, and satisfying finish."
4753,"<price>75<rating>92<whiskey>Blackadder Puff Adder (Batch PA 01), 46%<review>The nose starts with caramel-coated shortbread sprinkled with sea salt, then opens to reveal crushed almonds, raspberry jam, grilled pineapple, and a whiff of sweet peat smoke. Those raspberries explode on the palate, which is fruity and sweet but counterbalanced by brine, nuts, and smoke. The texture is oily and a bit waxy, mouth-coating and lush without being heavy: a slithering snake indeed, and pure elegance. (500 bottles for the U.S.)"
4754,"<price>41<rating>85<whiskey>Filibuster Dual Cask Finished Bourbon, 45%<review>Faintly herbal but mostly sweet aromas: Swedish fish, Twizzlers, treacle, marshmallow, and toasted almonds, as well as Lipton tea bag and pine needles. The flavor is dominated by oak, along with charred corn, black pepper, roasted nuts, and pipe tobacco, while the finish takes a slight turn with lingering pine and cigar notes."
4755,"<price>19<rating>85<whiskey>Wolfhound, 40%<review>Ripe orchard fruits, white flowers, saltines, green apple candy, and a hint of floor polish on the nose, along with pie crust that expresses itself as a sweet nuttiness on the palate. The flavors are simple—caramel, roasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate, and orange—and the finish short. If you’re after an ordinary Irish blend, this should do the trick. (Total Wine & More)"
4756,"<price>235<rating>90<whiskey>Octomore Dialogos 10 year old, 56.8%<review>Distilled from malt peated to 167 ppm, this whisky’s complex maturation program includes first-fill port and cognac, second-fill American whiskey, and virgin oak casks. The nose is sweet, with ginger, marzipan, rock pools, and floral smokiness. Initially, barley sugar and malt on the palate, then drier, with a hint of iodine, medicated soap, old leather, and dried peat. Peppery, with antiseptic and smoky oak in the finish. (12,000 bottles)"
4757,"<price>35<rating>89<whiskey>Kilbeggan Small Batch Rye, 43%<review>Pot still rye whiskey containing 30% rye with malted and unmalted barley, and the only Kilbeggan distilled entirely on-site. This has a nose of Japanese rice crackers, fennel seeds, cracker bread, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A light structure of creamy pear, ginger loaf, clotted cream toffee, and vanilla before a peppery blast leads into the toasty rye flavors, with a finish of glittering spice and malty bread notes."
4758,"<price>31<rating>75<whiskey>Hirsch Canadian Rye Whisky, 8 year old, 43%<review>There are three different Hirsch Canadian Whisky expressions: 8, 10, and 12 years old. The 8 year old is my pick of the three, with some creamy vanilla, biscuit, subtle caramel, and a hint of honey. The alcohol is quite dominant and the finish unrefined with solvent-like notes. The 10 and 12 year olds express less flavor complexity and are somewhat harsh on the finish. They’re not good enough to drink neat or on the rocks and too expensive to drink as a mixer ($38 for the 10 year old; $44 for the 12 year old.). Rating for the 10 year old: 72; rating for the 12 year old: 70.

4759,"<price>45<rating>91<whiskey>Manatawny Still Works Small Batch Port Barrel-Finished American Whiskey (Batch 19), 47%<review>Made with a mashbill of malted barley, malted wheat, oats, and rye, aged in new charred oak, and finished in a port-style wine cask. The result of this complex recipe is an equally complex sensory experience, with tropical and candied fruit on the nose, including dried mango slices, pineapple chunks, raspberry and blackberry jelly candies, and grape jam, as well as matcha, rose petals, and dark chocolate. Floral flavors run almost to soapy, but are tempered by cedar, layered spice, nuts, chocolate, and tobacco. A lovely finish, with persistent dark fruit, spices, and lengthy bitter-sweetness."
4760,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon, 45.7%<review>After regular bourbon maturation, this is finished in a barrel made from toasted wood with no charring (and no age statement). The wood character of the nose is restrained; corn, vanilla, some nuts and light citrus, but just a light hint of oak spice. Complex mouth: corn pudding, cornmeal, sugar cookies, caramel, pawpaw, jackfruit, and a real creaminess that stretches into the finish…where we get the delayed oak. Mature whiskey smooth, young whiskey lively, and a good price, too. Sourced whiskey."
4761,"<price>50<rating>89<whiskey>Bulleit Barrel Strength, 59.7%<review>High rye is evident, with rounded baking spices up front, leather, muted caramel, vanilla, and a hint of tobacco. This ABV beast coasts with the warmth and richness of crème brûlée, toffee, cinnamon rock candy, fruit, and nutmeg. Oh wait, there’s more. Smoke kicks in toward the end with marshmallow undertones and more cinnamon, finishing strong with lasting spice. This is a cask strength sipper or a lovely bourbon on the rocks."
4762,"<price>104<rating>91<whiskey>St. George's Chapter 7 Rum Finish 2011 edition, 46%<review>Any lingering doubts that English whisky means business are dispelled by this whisky masterclass. This is a New Orleans show band of a whisky, bursting with vibrancy and happy, celebratory notes. The cask is all over this, with rum and raisin, milk chocolate, and mocha contributing to an all-round sweet treat. Not too sweet, though; and the malt at the center of this sings. £65"
4763,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Balvenie 14 year old The Week of Peat, 48.3%<review>Made from the same recipe as previous Peat Week bottlings, with the name referring to the one week per year Balvenie distills peated whisky. Stone fruits lightly smoked in a peat kiln on the early nose, new leather, and honey. Sweet peat smoke, orchard fruits, and soft spices on the palate. The fruits darken in the finish, with licorice and spicy oak. (18,000 bottles)"
4764,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail Single Cask #1535 (distilled at Rosebank) 1991 Vintage, 59.2% ABV<review>A very traditional Rosebank-aged in a refill hogshead and bottled fairly young (12 years old). Rosebank is one of the better, yet lesser known Lowland single malts. Since the distillery was closed down in 1993, it will continue being unfamiliar to most, and finding young Rosebanks like this one will become increasingly more difficult. Here’s one at cask strength. The whisky turns very cloudy with the addition of water due to lack of chill filtering, but the additional water brings out the whisky’s subtle aromas and flavors-fresh cut grass, hay, delicate fruit, and a gentle malty sweetness. Ironically, I actually enjoyed some of the recent young G&M Rosebanks bottled at 40% ABV better than this one-their flavors were cleaner, brighter, and more refined. Still, this is a fair representation of the Lowland style.

4765,"<price>60<rating>80<whiskey>Scapa Skiren, 40%<review>A new NAS expression from Scapa on Orkney, matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. An initial hint of lime cordial, then musty peaches, almonds, cinnamon, and table salt. More peaches on the palate, with tinned pear and a little honey. Tingling spices in the drying finish, which soon becomes quite bitter – detracting from the overall balance."
4766,"<price>89<rating>95<whiskey>Masterson’s 10 year old Rye (batch PSA3), 45%<review>This 100% rye-grain whisky is distilled in Alberta, then shipped to Sonoma, California for final touches. Finished in new American oak, batch PSA3 is one of the tastiest U.S. bottlings of Canadian rye ever. Soft caramels cushion ethereal honeysuckle, blackened firewood, and lusty rye spices on a framework of pulling oak tannins. Hugely complex, with new rewards in every sip."
4767,"<price>115<rating>90<whiskey>Blue Hanger 9th Release, 45.6%<review>You have to take your hat off to Berry Bros. & Rudd’s Doug McIvor, who is whisky's answer to Bruce Springsteen: consistently brilliant, complex, spanning the generations, and in the form of his life. This just doesn't let up, with plenty of smoke and peat in the mix, but with citrus fruits, some plummy depths, and a vanilla cushion. It’s balanced perfectly. Born to run? You betcha."
4768,"<price>1000<rating>92<whiskey>The Macallan 1961 Vintage, 54.1%<review>Deep amber color. Complex aromas of lush fruit (orange, lemon, red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon, clove, and licorice). Rich, silky body. Great balance and depth of flavor, with complex fruit and wood spices similar to its aroma all wrapped in toffee and vanilla fudge. Very long, evolving, and satisfying finish."
4769,"<price>65<rating>82<whiskey>Connoisseurs Choice (distilled at Mannochmore), 15 year old, 1990 vintage, 46%<review>Fragrant aromas of ripe barley and vanilla, with some background pear, hay, dusty cocoa, ginger, and lemon grass. Similar follow through on the palate, with a creamy mouthcoating texture throughout and a drying finish. Nice anytime.

4770,"<price>1000<rating>92<whiskey>Glen Moray Mastery, 52.3%<review>Glen Moray is celebrating its 120th anniversary with Mastery, a vatting from 1978, 1988, 1994, 1999, and 2001. Maturation—and finishing—has occurred in a mix of bourbon, sherry, madeira, and port casks. Resinous sherry, smoky red wine, caramel, and vanilla on the nose. Voluptuous on the palate, with sherry, succulent stewed fruit, soft toffee, and cocoa powder. Long in the gently spiced finish, with port-soaked oak. (1,000 bottles)"
4771,"<price>72<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 10 year old, 46%<review>Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of brine on the early nose, with damp earth, citrus fruit, cereal, and mildly smoky oak. The palate is supple and offers vanilla toffee, cedarwood, hazelnuts, and more brine. A spicy finish yields coconut and a hint of dry peat."
4772,"<price>77<rating>84<whiskey>Oban Distillers Edition 1996, 43%<review>This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original."
4773,"<price>61<rating>88<whiskey>Douglas Laing Rock Oyster Cask Strength, 57.4%<review>A dense, suffocating fog of peat smoke, sea salt, dry seaweed on the high tide, and lemon-scented candles. Remember to come up for air once in a while. A supple, silky texture of lemon mousse, baked apple, vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and a massive rush of pepper. Hold this in your mouth for as long as possible; the flavor delivery is impressively long and constantly evolving. Hot, drying finish, and, frankly, a relief from the peppery assault on the palate. £47"
4774,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Ainsley Brae Sherry Cask Finished Highland, 40%<review>An initial aroma of carrot peelings gives way to cedar, allspice, lemon, and chamomile; with water added, carrot cake, almond shell, and lemon icing emerge. On the palate there’s chamomile tea with lemon and clove, candied violet, orange, and cedar, swooping into a finish of oak and dried flowers. (Total Wine & More)"
4775,"<price>33<rating>80<whiskey>66 Gilead Du Bois, 40%<review>My goodness, this woman is an innovator. Distillery owner Sophia Pantazi stored her maple syrup in whisky barrels. Then once the syrup was bottled, she refilled those barrels with whisky spirit, giving maple-aged whisky. Grain, chocolate, and winter-welcome glowing spices quickly overtake a malty, grainy, perfumey note characteristic of young whisky. Though creamy sweet, the whisky has more toffee notes than maple syrup. Hot beyond its ABV and wanting a couple more years’ maturation. (Distillery only) Price is per 375 ml."
4776,"<price>100<rating>93<whiskey>Highland Park 21 year old, 47.5%<review>The good news: This is one of the best Highland Park whiskies I have ever tasted. The bad news: it’s the new release for Travel Retail (formerly Duty Free). It’s lush, well-balanced, and very complex. Well-defined notes of toffee, candied fruit, and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey, chocolate mousse, and smoke. Here’s the icing on the cake: it’s bottled at 47.5%, which really allows the flavors to shine. If you’re going overseas, consider tracking down a bottle."
4777,"<price>27<rating>89<whiskey>The Forager Botanical, 40%<review>This gem from Forty Creek revives the tradition of adding herbs to whisky. Subdued
toffee on the nose rolls into a general earthiness, followed by prune juice and gentle
spirit. The palate immediately shows white pepper with sweet soothing caramels
behind, finishing in a long, vaguely woody herbal essence. Added herbs subtly
enhance the whisky flavors rather than offering their own. If ever a whisky sparkled,
this is it. $35 CAD"
4778,"<price>80<rating>82<whiskey>Reservoir Rye Whiskey Year II, Batch 6, 50%<review>A restrained nose of fresh-cut oak, grassy rye, and a fleeting trace of solvents. Quite sweet in the mouth, spicy and minty, and the alcohol is fiery: this is young rye. Still, it's much less forward and rudely insistent than I'd expected; not at all the ripsnorter some young ryes are. This could be pleasant, but the finish is a letdown: sweet, mealy, uninspiring."
4779,"<price>31<rating>85<whiskey>Stalk & Barrel Red Label Blend, 43%<review>Raising the bar a little higher, Still Waters is introducing Red Label, a blend that is rich in 100% rye, all-corn, and single malt whiskies. The undisclosed base whisky is sourced, the rest made in-house. Luscious with sweet esters, lilacs, white clover blossoms, oak sugars, vanilla, and a brace of warming spices. Round, mouth-filling, and creamy on the palate, and after a second, pleasing rye spices emerge. Hints of barrel notes with glowing pepper and citrus pith. Mix or sip. C$40"
4780,"<price>90<rating>82<whiskey>Blood Oath Pact No. 1, 49.3%<review>A blend of three bourbons, between 6 and 12 years old; two rye and one wheat. Nothing is revealed on the source, which is a fair part of the “blood oath,” apparently. A restrained nose of corncakes, biscuits, a bit of cinnamon and maple: breakfasty. Flavors of corn, spicy oak, and some grassy mint fight to be heard over roaring heat that flames on into the finish. Frankly too simple for the asking price. Sourced whiskey."
4781,"<price>322<rating>87<whiskey>Glenrothes 1978, 43%<review>Though this has been on the shelves in the UK for a while, its U.S. release has been delayed. It shows a classic mature ‘Rothes nose, mixing moist fruitcake, vanilla, and a tickle of maltiness. What sets this apart is the weight of the stewed fruit and a dry note reminiscent of light rain on tweed. The palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. Worth the wait. "
4782,"<price>30<rating>85<whiskey>Grant’s Elementary Carbon 6 year old, 40%<review>The black-labeled Carbon relates to heavily charred casks, which bring aromas of toffee, raisin, chocolate, dark concentrated fruits, barbecued meat, and ashy soot. The smokiness broods malevolently if you leave the glass. The texture feels too light to shoulder the flavors of dark char, toffee, spice, and dark fruity chocolate as the balance becomes swamped in smoke. It’s like a young child wearing their father’s thickest winter overcoat. (Global Travel Retail only)"
4783,"<price>157<rating>91<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Fenix, 45.5%<review>Angela D’Orazio selected both birch sap wine and PX sherry casks, combined with a few punchy 30-liter casks for this beauty. An incredibly rich, intense, and complex nose; a medley of cooked fruits, cherry cake mix, marzipan, tree blossoms, stem ginger, herbs, cigar box, beech nuts, and scorched coconut. Unctuous and syrupy, the palate is immersed in vanilla extract, dry fruits, cocoa, and inky black coffee. A lengthy finish of oak, dark vanilla, and toasted coconut. Result? A whisky colossus. €140"
4784,"<price>50<rating>76<whiskey>Sunshine Reserve American whiskey, 42.5%<review>Raw oak, drywall, campfire, and glue open the sinuses.

Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90"
4786,"<price>340<rating>89<whiskey>Glen Elgin 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 54.8%<review>Matured in European oak butts, this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits.

4787,"<price>38<rating>84<whiskey>Jameson Bold, 40%<review>The second installment in the deconstruction of Jameson Original, this is a punchy, pot still-led whiskey with a nose of white peppercorn, cinnamon breakfast cereal, whole nutmeg, and a chocolate-coconut slice. Soft, waxy beginning, strong vanilla flavors, golden syrup, fresh apple, and huge barley notes, though the spices are surprisingly easygoing. It’s worth comparing to its brothers, Lively and Round. Of the trio, this is closest to Original. Peppery finish with long lasting barley sweetness. (Travel Retail exclusive) €36"
4788,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Kurayoshi 3 year old, 46%<review>Aged for just 3 years, the nose is a fresh fruit salad of green apple, honeydew, lychee, and kumquat. The green fruits and tangy citrus on the palate fall under attack from peppery arugula leaves and active spices. A structure as light as cotton candy; the flavor of orange taffy is all that remains when the dust settles. The finish is dry and peppery, with a slight herbal note. (1,440 bottles)"
4789,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Jefferson’s Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask-Finished Bourbon, 45.1%<review>Cherry bubble gum, white grape juice, hazelnuts, brown sugar, and rye bread on the nose. The palate is bright and gently spiced, with a soft, creamy texture and restrained grape, black tea, nut, and chocolate flavors. Coffee beans, nutty chocolate, and persistent oak on the finish. Surprisingly austere for a wine cask-finished bourbon, but to good effect."
4790,"<price>35<rating>83<whiskey>Relativity American Whisky (prototype), 40%<review>Generously woody with pencil shavings and lumber mingled with chamomile, white flowers, and vanilla on the nose. The light-bodied palate is sweet and floral, with cloying milk chocolate, toasted coconut, and vanilla flavors. It’s just a bit simple and boring.

This or whiskey has been matured using alternative aging technology.

4791,"<price>30<rating>88<whiskey>Eagle Rare 10 year old Straight, 45%<review>Sweet candy shop, nougat, and honeycomb flavors are underscored by some funky earth and mushroom notes. The palate is sweet and lively, delivering orange peel and subtle hints of baking spice. Overall a pleasant pour, with the only criticism that it feels rather light-bodied, with the oak a bit sharp. Adding water makes this bourbon feel underpowered and hollow, but it is a fine sipper otherwise."
4792,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Ninety Nine Proof, 49.5%<review>A distillery exclusive until now, Ninety Nine Proof is finally in distribution across the U.S. One hundred days finishing in Gretzky’s own cabernet sauvignon barrels put wagonloads of ripe fruit on the nose, with some dry hardwood, peanut brittle, and a slight tickle too. This is powerful whisky, quite fruity, with long, fading dry pepper and an inviting hint of spent gunpowder leading to a dry, slightly woody finish."
4793,"<price>555<rating>90<whiskey>BenRiach Authenticus 30 year old, 46%<review>Following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of Authenticus, BenRiach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. The nose offers orchard fruits, honey, polished oak, and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. Full and fruity on the palate, with sweet peat having a presence, plus milk chocolate and licorice. The finish is relatively long, with citrus fruit, ashy smoke, and a lingering herbal note. £400; Not available in the U.S."
4794,"<price>120<rating>95<whiskey>Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2015 Release), 54.3%<review>Seamless in flavor and very elegant. A fully matured bourbon (consisting of whiskeys from 11 to 16 years in age), yet quite fresh on the palate. Lively fruit (apricot, red raspberry, tangerine) on a bed of lush sweet notes (caramel, honey-coconut crème brûlée and cotton candy), peppered with cinnamon, clove, and crisp mint. Soft finish, with lingering creamy vanilla. Not as great as the legendary 2013 release, but close."
4795,"<price>100<rating>94<whiskey>The Antiquary, 21 year old, 43%<review>Drier than the 12 year old (reviewed below), with some darker fruit (black raspberry, blueberry) marrying with the brighter orchard fruit.  Sweet up front - honey and caramel - with a peppering of spice (dried vanilla, clove, and cinnamon) increasing as the palate develops.  Dry, oak spice finish.  Lovely!

4796,"<price>15<rating>86<whiskey>Heaven Hill Bottled in Bond 6 year old, 50%<review>Sweet reek of the warehouse; sugary bourbon drooling and drying on oak staves, the richly boozy air, dusty wood. It’s all here, like Bardstown in a bottle. Enters with authority, a hot rush of corn, solidly oak-edged, sizzling with allspice and cinnamon, and backed with a solid strop of leather. Then the sun comes up: a sweet, glowing finish. Beautifully bridges the gap between young and old bourbon, and an absolute steal at the price."
4797,"<price>109<rating>81<whiskey>Glenfiddich 125th Anniversary, 43%<review>Bottled for this auspicious occasion, this is a Glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky, not from casks (à la Caoran) but the distillate. Fresh, with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. On the palate, the reverse happens, with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. It’s vibrant and needs water, and is a lot of fun. Happy Birthday!

4798,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Old Forester Birthday Bourbon (bottled 2012), 48.5%<review>Honeyed citrus, vanilla, and hints of toasted coconut on the nose.  Similar follow-through on the palate—sweeter up front and then becoming dry with firm spice and toasted nuts. Long, resinous, warm spice finish.  I’d like a little less dried spice on the finish—or more sweetness to balance it. Otherwise, a nice bourbon."
4799,"<price>194<rating>79<whiskey>Nant French Oak Port Matured, 43%<review>Nant is everything an idyllic island distillery should be, sited in the wilds of Tasmania with a smart visitor center and a bar that overlooks the rolling, rugged countryside. The whiskey, though, is surprisingly gentle and soft. There is an overly simplistic sweet sherry version, but this gutsier, berry-soaked, sweet and rounded version is the one to watch. It's a work in progress, but the cleanliness and flavor development hint at great things. Watch this space.  $AUS 190/500 ml"
4800,"<price>1008<rating>84<whiskey>The Balvenie DCS Compendium 1st Chapter 1997 17 year old (Cask #5365), 60.7%<review>The mix of honey, citrus, fruit, and malt which sits at Balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. The citrus fruits, for example, are becoming concentrated, the honey is set clover, the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. Rounded and thick in the mouth, where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control, before a bloom of bridal bouquet. Tremendously complex, here’s Balvenie's flowering into mid-period maturity. The price is…scary! £700"
4801,"<price>90<rating>83<whiskey>Chieftain’s (distilled at Glen Moray), 1989 vintage, 18 year old, 43%<review>Clean, simple, and straightforward: malty and smooth, with cut grass, hay, a kiss of honey, and a hint of gin botanicals. A nice whisky to introduce blend drinkers to the world of single malts."
4802,"<price>35<rating>87<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Old Scout American Whiskey (Batch 31), 49.5%<review>A clean and inviting nose featuring fresh hay, cooked corn, Peanut Chews, vanilla custard, and black pepper. Chewy and mouth-filling texture, with black cherry, peanuts in Coke, caramel, peanut-butter molasses cookies, and supple spices, ending with more cherry and mature oak flavors. Straightforward, uncomplicated, and satisfying: a good all-rounder."
4803,"<price>68<rating>80<whiskey>Longmorn The Distiller’s Choice, 40%<review>The latest in Chivas Bros. no age statement (NAS) variant of their malts and while the nose here does have Longmorn’s fruity elements, they are discreet. This is also the case on the palate, where what is usually thick, elegant, and fruity has had its volume turned down. Blind, it’s a nice dram, but I don’t want nice from Longmorn, I want great. £47"
4804,"<price>30<rating>80<whiskey>Trader Joe's (distilled at Imperial), 12 year old, 40%<review>A whisky very typical of this distillery, which has been silent since 1998. Rich and thick on the nose and palate; oozing vanilla, ripe malt, cotton candy, powdered sugar, new-mown hay, and lemon tart. Cinnamon, evergreen, and a wisp of smoke round out the palate. An evolving whisky -- starts out heavy and sweet, then turns clingingly dry. A fun, rare whisky for a reasonable price."
4805,"<price>60<rating>89<whiskey>Triple Eight Nor'easter Blended Bourbon, 44.4%<review>This blend of bourbons (both sourced and house-made) is partly finished in PX sherry casks, and that influence makes itself known through aromas of candied pecans, honey, raisins, figs, oranges, and white pepper, along with cigar wrapper, rose petal, and some minerality. The palate is replete with roasted corn, dried dates, candied almonds, oranges, raspberry-jam cookies, cinnamon bark, and plenty of oak—a flavorful and elegant combination with silky mouthfeel and good balance."
4806,"<price>108<rating>87<whiskey>The Whisky Exchange (distilled at Linkwood) 16 year old, 48%<review>The combination of Linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. Not here. The nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it’s light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. There’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. £65"
4807,"<price>600<rating>94<whiskey>Midleton 175th Anniversary Bottling 26 year old, 40%<review>Deep amber color with shade of ruby. Sweet aromas of ripe fruit, oak, caramelized sugar, rum, and creamy vanilla. Full in body for an Irish whiskey, with a silky, creamy texture. Voluptuous flavors of burnt sugar, rum, honeyed fruit, creamy vanilla, and spice cake.Here's a whiskey the blends the old with the new. The whiskey was distilled at the old Midleton distillery, which has been dismantled. After spending most of its life in sherry and bourbon casks, it was then finished off in port pipes. It maintains its Irish-ness, its pot still character is both satisfying and reassuring, and the port pipe aging introduces flavors that make the whiskey very intriguing. An outstanding product! Around 400 bottles for the United States."
4808,"<price>50<rating>80<whiskey>Ardmore Traditional Cask, 46%<review>A distillery bottling of Ardmore finally comes to the U.S. This one is non-chill filtered and finished in a “Quarter Cask,” similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask (same owners). Ardmore remains one of the few Speyside whiskies made with peat-smoked malt. Chewy, almost oily-textured, with sweet notes of toffee and caramel up front, followed by emerging damp, earthy peat and bourbon-like notes. The oaky, resinous bourbon lingers through the finish. The bourbon oak intensity dominates to a degree, disrupting the harmony of the remaining flavors. A whisky of great potential, but still waiting to achieve some of it."
4809,"<price>50<rating>91<whiskey>Wild Turkey Kentucky Spirit (Barrel #98), 50.5%<review>A single barrel bottling from Warehouse N, rick number 1, bottled at the proof that Wild Turkey was designed to be. A deeply-woody spiced nose featuring cinnamon and caramel advertises a power punch whiskey, but on the palate there's no punch. Instead, it’s lush, round, and affable, with deep caramel and cinnamon co-mingling with peanut. The lush, sweet start is well-balanced by cinnamon spice, which ramps up and drives a long spicy finish. This is delicious whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)"
4810,"<price>4474<rating>91<whiskey>Nikka 40 year old, 45%<review>A celebration of Nikka’s 80th anniversary, and, in the spirit of the founding principles of Masataka Taketsuru, it’s a blend. The oldest cask here is Yoichi from 1945, there’s also a Miyagikyo from 1969. Only 900 bottles have been made. Huge whisky rancio, delicate smoke, light varnish, wax, hints of incense, and while rich, there is still remarkably fresh tropical fruit. Tasted blind, it could easily be mistaken for a Grand Champagne Cognac. Amazing length and purity. Sophisticated. €3,600"
4811,"<price>50<rating>88<whiskey>Hickory Hill 12 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 2), 45%<review>Aromas of peanuts, sassafras, Cheerwine soda, nutty oak, and a sweep of cloves, allspice, and ginger, sprinkled with blackberries and cherries. There’s zippy citrus on the palate, a nice lift of heavier oak, roasted nut, dark chocolate, and baking spice flavors. But the richness stops short on the finish, which is light and quick. (Total Wine & More)"
4812,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Driftless Glen Single Barrel Straight Bourbon, 48%<review>Oak-forward from start to finish, with aromas of new wood, fresh and dried flowers, oranges, candy apple, cherry soda, and iced tea. Wood, fresh apple, semi-dark chocolate, orange, iced tea, chamomile, and a sweep of spices roll into a cinnamon, clove, and chocolate finish that remains oak-dominated."
4813,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park Full Volume, 47.2%<review>Full Volume is a U.S.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish."
4814,"<price>27<rating>80<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7, 40%<review>Initially, it’s earth and fruit. This develops into sawdust, more earth, and bananas. From here, it’s green pepper, banana nut bread, and warm corn tortillas over a soft mouthfeel with little complexity. This will work in a pinch and it’s great in ginger ale, Coca-Cola, or lighter cocktails, but it’s probably best over ice."
4815,"<price>73<rating>85<whiskey>WhistlePig Farmstock Rye Crop 002, 43%<review>Whistle Pig raised the share of its own 2 year old rye from 20 percent to 32 percent in this second Farmstock release, balancing it against 6 and 10 year old sourced ryes, like in the 001 release. Fresh oak mixes with vanilla, orange peel, and pepper on the nose, leading to a palate of vanilla and butterscotch. Citrus emerges with water. Pepper notes return on the finish, along with chocolate and caramel. There’s youthfulness here, but also potential."
4816,"<price>126<rating>86<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Apple Basket 1997 (distilled at Clynelish), 46%<review>The latest Wemyss Malts single cask offering from Clynelish distillery is a 16 year old expression, matured in a hogshead which gave an out-turn of 339 bottles. The nose offers sea salt and lemon, with emerging green apples and vanilla. Apple tart with custard and a dusting of cinnamon on the palate. The finish is long and peppery, with a hint of freshly-ground coffee beans. £75"
4817,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Bruichladdich 3D The Big Peat, 50%<review>A marriage of Bruichladdich with three different peating levels. Devotees of young, smoky Islay whiskies will enjoy this one. It is youthful and explosive, with earthy peat smoke, fish nets, brine, and kiln ash. All this is tamed beautifully by notes of vanilla wafer, seductive malt, marshmallow, spiced peaches, and pear."
4818,"<price>69<rating>90<whiskey>Bedtime 8 year old Straight Bourbon (Batch #3), 45%<review>This Tennessee bourbon was bottled by non-distiller producer The Louisville Bourbon Transit Co. The nose offers toasted oak, blueberry pie, bakery shop, caramel, cinnamon spice, and bitter orange. A smooth palate of milk chocolate, melted caramel, blackberry, and black pepper is followed by a lightly spiced finish that offers more chocolate, as well as balanced oak, vanilla, coconut flakes, and almond. Spice melds with sweeter bourbon notes to create a unique, flavorful whiskey. (1,048 bottles)"
4819,"<price>2000<rating>89<whiskey>Port Askaig 45 year old, 40.8%<review>The nose offers apricots, honey, vanilla, nutmeg, orange juice, and a hint of mint. Jaffa orange, black banana, licorice, and chimney soot on the palate. Licorice lingers, with an herbal note and tannic oak in the finish. (51 bottles for the U.S.)"
4820,"<price>100<rating>83<whiskey>Cask & Thistle (distilled at Glenlivet) 30 year old 1973 Vintage, 46%<review>Its deep amber/ruby color suggests a lot of sherry, and one whiff confirms. The whisky is rich and sappy in texture, with lush notes of ripe sherry fruit balanced by dry, mature spicy oak. There’s a pleasant soothing texture to the whisky too, but I do struggle to find the subtle complexities which make some bottlings of Glenlivet so special. There’s just so much oak and sherry dominating. At its best after dinner or with a cigar."
4821,"<price>48<rating>84<whiskey>Talisker Skye, 45.8%<review>The latest release from Talisker is an NAS bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill American oak casks. According to the distiller, this is “An easy-drinking Talisker…more approachable, but still definitely Talisker.” Certainly approachable on the nose, with tangerines, honey, and milk chocolate, before ozone and peat smoke develop. Ginger and a hint of coal tar. Medium-bodied, with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices, though never overwhelming. Spicy peat, white pepper, and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33"
4822,"<price>110<rating>89<whiskey>Miyagikyo 12 year old, 45%<review>The first impression is of dried apricot compote, pomegranate, sweet persimmon, a little touch of anise, then herbs and strawberry. Quite creamy, with fine structure and, with water, cappuccino and quince jelly. There's a hint of char on the palate to start, then the sweetness returns, making the mid-palate distinctly peachy, with added poached orchard fruits. Broad and quite elegant, with a smooth delivery. Water lightens things, allowing more floral elements to develop. Versatile."
4823,"<price>175<rating>89<whiskey>Auchroisk 20 year old, 58.1%<review>Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 
Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 
In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish. "
4824,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated, 46%<review>Rich fruit, spiced orange, fudge, fragrant spices, and sweet, playful smoke make for a splendid nosing experience. The piscine flavors, however, may best suit smokeheads, as, along with fudge and vanilla, this has a splendid flavor of oily, smoky kippers. Golden syrup, green apple, and black pepper emerge, but the smoked-fish flavors spill into the finish to swim with pepper and fruity sweetness."
4825,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Clynelish 1993, Gordon & MacPhail Connoisseurs’ Choice range, 43%<review>Refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest Gordon & MacPhail bottling of Clynelish, the most northerly distillery in Diageo’s portfolio. Initially quite earthy on the nose, with mustard seeds, pepper, and contrasting malt. Becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. Quite oily in texture, the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate, then sweet fruit notes, malt, and spice emerge, plus a delicate thread of smoke. The finish dries slowly, with a hint of peat."
4826,"<price>22<rating>86<whiskey>Berentzen Bushel & Barrel, 30%<review>Most flavored whiskeys start with an existing whiskey and add flavoring, but Bushel & Barrel comes at it from the other end, mixing Berentzen’s apple liqueur with a Kentucky bourbon. Bright, crisp apple cider defines the opening, while in the mid-palate subtle bourbon notes emerge with vanilla, honey, cinnamon, and light oak. The bourbon notes complement the sweet apple cider and help keep things from getting too sweet. Bourbon and cider have always been buddies, and they do quite well together here."
4827,"<price>512<rating>85<whiskey>The Lost Distilleries Blend (batch 6), 49.3%<review>The sixth incarnation of Master of Malt’s cult blend of closed distillery whiskies contains Port Ellen, Brora, Mosstowie, Glenisla, Imperial, Caperdonich, and Glen Mhor with grain whisky from Port Dundas. Apples and sugar browning in a pan, smooth driftwood, and dairy fudge, but with the Glenisla it’s noticeably smokier than earlier batches. Sweet blancmange initially, before it soars to a tangy, spicy peak; the peat smoke backed by white pepper, ground ginger, peanuts, and florentines. Smokin’ liquid history. (534 bottles) £350"
4828,"<price>624<rating>92<whiskey>Lagavulin 21 year old 2012 Special Release, 52%<review>Lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? There’s unusual. This is huge, fluxing, and complex, mixing saddles and dark chocolate, pu-erh tea and smothered kiln, geranium and velvet, gamey venison and treacle. The smoke is integrated, the fires ember-like, the oak there but not oppressively so. Massive, dense, layered, and complex, this needs time to open. In short, a distillation of Islay and up alongside last year’s Jazz Festival bottling."
4829,"<price>40<rating>85<whiskey>Glengoyne 10 year old, 40%<review>Glengoyne’s entry-level 10 year old is the most readily available of their malts, and is made using entirely unpeated malt. The producers claim this helps to preserve “the essence of its flavor.” Fresh and well-rounded on the nose, with medium sweet aromas suggesting malt, oak, and a hint of sherry. Smooth and delicate on the palate, it is slightly oaky, with a suggestion of cooking apples. The finish is pleasingly long, with buttery, vanilla notes, slowly drying."
4830,"<price>20<rating>88<whiskey>Rebel Yell 100 Proof Kentucky Straight, 50%<review>Honey-roasted peanuts, maple syrup, and stone fruits are underscored by deep earthy notes of tobacco leaf, dried apple, sassafras leaves, and candied nuts. The palate expresses some tropical dried pineapple fruit and sweet butterscotch, turning full and spicy, with pleasant chocolate and cinnamon hearts candies lending lots of verve and some complexity on the medium finish.

4831,"<price>25<rating>79<whiskey>Heaven Hill Trybox Series Corn, 62.5%<review>New make from the same mashbill as Evan Williams, bottled “straight from the still.” Much higher proof than the others, but not noticeably hotter in the nose; that’s light corn and grass, with a bit of minty spice. Hotter in the mouth, but quite pleasant and evolving: fresh mint gives way to light corn, then a slightly oily slip to brisk sweetness…and you realize you didn’t notice the serious overproof. A well-behaved white dog."
4832,"<price>92<rating>82<whiskey>Whisky Castle Oloroso (Cask 494), 48%<review>Another creation from Elfingen, Switzerland, this rich, dark, chestnut-color dram combines their Smoke Barley with oloroso cask maturation. The nose is a merry mix of sweet peat smoke cushioned by Serrano ham, dried fig, and fish box reek. Berry fruits and sultana initially, though the texture is quite tannic with the stronger alcohol showing through. It develops a bubblegum note, with over-boiled fruit and some savory meat juices rounding off a short, dry finish. CHF89"
4833,"<price>170<rating>91<whiskey>Fukano 16 year old Sherry Cask Rice Whisky, 42.8%<review>Date, raisin, forest honey, star anise, black cherry, graham cracker, and wood spices on the nose. Although it’s a first-fill sherry cask, this has a fine balance of sherry influence without letting the cask dominate the aromas. A good mouthful of dark fruit, toffee sweetness, plum, and mild spices, but after the initial tasty burst of sherry fruit, it doesn’t discernibly develop further complexity. (1,124 bottles)"
4834,"<price>55<rating>88<whiskey>Tweeddale Grain of Truth, 46%<review>Toasted coconut, custard cream biscuits, vanilla, freshly peeled banana skins, and ice cream wafers make this an enticing olfactory prospect. Vanilla, lemon, cream, and shortbread, this puffs out beautifully with a tug of pepper, always in balance, before relaxing into lemon meringue pie territory, with those sweet lemons persisting into the finish. A mellow, well-balanced offering, but you’ll know the truth when you taste it."
4835,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>Bulleit Bourbon, 45%<review>Soft, elegant, and nicely rounded, with honeyed orchard fruit and gentle spice on a bed of vanilla and caramel. Very versatile; a pleasing, unchallenging bourbon to suit most moods and situations. I actually like it better than the new, older 10 year old expression (reviewed in this issue), because it is so beautifully balanced."
4836,"<price>500<rating>91<whiskey>Cragganmore 25 year old (Diageo Special Release 2014), 51.4%<review>The question is how this stacks up against the Friends of the Classic Malts bottling, one of my 2014 highlights. This shows mature distillery character with that discreet meaty undertow bedding down exuberant top notes: icing sugar on rhum baba, preserved lime, crystallized fruits, honey, pecan, fig, and scented woods. Typical of Cragganmore in its constantly shape-shifting character. The palate is concentrated orchard fruits, dried fruits, light spice, chestnut puree, and a little smoke. So yes, in the same league. (3,372 bottles)"
4837,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Bladnoch 17 year old, 46.7%<review>Ripe peaches, vanilla, sweet oak, and milky coffee on the nose. The palate is luscious and smooth, with sweet orange notes and cinnamon. The finish is medium in length, with spicy berry fruits, oak, and lingering ginger."
4838,"<price>173<rating>93<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenturret) 35 year old, 48%<review>Sherry cask matured in its entirety, this rich, southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange, sweet cherry, plum, nutty fruitcake, and pleasant oak. Beautifully balanced, it showcases sweet orange, red fruits, baked Victoria plum, and brown sugar, while ginger and pepper sparkle across the tongue. Honey and stewed fruits mollify the throat. An absolute joy."
4839,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Royal Brackla) 2006 11 year old, 58.2%<review>Distilled in 2006, this was filled into a virgin French oak cask (#310865) and bottled at cask strength after 11 years. Peaches and apricots on the early nose, with a hint of cloves. Ultimately very floral, with vanilla fudge. The palate yields zesty orchard fruits, malt, and ginger. Remaining fruity in the long finish, with black pepper and juicy oak. (286 bottles)"
4840,"<price>75<rating>96<whiskey>Crown Royal Monarch, 40%<review>Monarch, the 75th anniversary limited edition of Canada’s best-selling whisky, raises the already high Crown Royal flavor bar. Zesty rye from an ancient Coffey still is the throbbing heart of this blend, balancing cloves, ginger, cinnamon, glowing hot pepper, and that gorgeous sour bitterness of rye grain against crispy, fresh-sawn lumber, fragrant lilacs, dark fruits, and green apples. Butterscotch, chocolate, toffee, mint, pine needles, and sweet pitchy balsam enrich a luscious, creamy mouthfeel carefully tempered by grapefruit pith. Editor's Choice"

Then, brown sugar butter and maple syrup over buttermilk pancakes, Cracker Jack, raw honey, bittersweet chocolate, and hints of pecan shell. Extremely long finish with a fried apple pie note. An incredibly complex and intense, must-have sipper. Perfection."
4842,"<price>3500<rating>95<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Blue Anniversary, 60%<review>Formulated to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Johnnie Walker. This is a fabulous whisky for anyone who can spring for the bottle. It is deep, dark, and quite powerful with a hefty malt foundation and sweeter notes of toffee and vanilla combined with resinous oak, complex fruit (both bright citrus notes and darker pit fruits), crisp mint, tobacco, polished leather, and heavy peat smoke. A tour de force of a blended scotch-as big as many single malts reviewed here.

4843,"<price>384<rating>86<whiskey>Old Pulteney 30 year old (2013 Edition), 40.1%<review>Apart from the 40 year old expression launched in 2012, this is the oldest Old Pulteney on the market, and annual batches are
released with slightly varying strengths. Refill bourbon casks have been used in their maturation. Sweet and zesty on the deceptively youthful nose, with banoffee pie, eating apples, and quite sweet oak on the palate. Cereal notes and pleasing oak in the lengthy finish. £250"
4844,"<price>104<rating>83<whiskey>Wemyss Malts Bench with a Sea View (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 46%<review>Unusually, Wemyss Malts simultaneously offered two single cask bottlings of Clynelish in October 2014, both distilled in 1997 and matured in hogsheads. ‘Bench with a Sea View’ provided an out-turn of 371 bottles. The nose is sweet and fruity, with green apples and chocolate mousse. Slightly oily on the palate, with black pepper, salt, and orchard fruits. Persistently peppery in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, a hint of brine, and cocoa. £68"
4845,"<price>90<rating>84<whiskey>Edradour Port Cask, 6th Release, cask #383, 46%<review>The latest in this Perthshire distillery’s ongoing Port Cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. The nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacé cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke. "
4846,"<price>70<rating>93<whiskey>Booker’s 2018-03 “Kentucky Chew,” 63.35%<review>Originally touted by Booker Noe, the “Kentucky Chew” is a way of tasting whiskey: swishing it around your mouth, then swallowing and smacking your lips—an urge that’s hard to resist with this intensely flavorful bourbon. Aromas of peanuts, cherry cola, candied ginger, blackberry jam, and curing tobacco are echoed on the palate, which has grape jelly, blueberry pie, peanuts in Coke, Mexican hot chocolate, and a hint of licorice. The finish is warming, lengthy, and sweet, with a lift of cherry and spice undercutting chocolate and oak."
4847,"<price>65<rating>96<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 67.4%<review>This whiskey has improved greatly over the past two years. (I thought that the 2007 release was almost too easy-going, as some wheated bourbons can be.) A little more oak spice has added balance, complexity, and depth. Very clean on the palate. Layered sweetness (toffee, caramel, maples syrup, elegant rum) provide a foundation for warming cinnamon, bramble, blueberry tart, sultana, light candy corn, herbal tea, and subtle marzipan. A soft, dry, polished oak finish ropes in all the sweetness, keeping me wanting more. Excellent!

4848,"<price>40<rating>82<whiskey>Abasolo 100% Ancestral Corn Whiskey, 43%<review>

Made from nixtamalized corn (a process that increases the grain’s nutritional value; it’s used when making masa for tortillas), double-distilled, and aged in new toasted and used oak casks. It’s unconventional, as most Mexican corn whiskeys are; the nose has caramel, stewed apples and pears, orange peel, candied almond, and pencil eraser. A bit papery and green on the palate, with Popsicle stick, dried apple rings, and toasted grain, finishing hot and short."
4849,"<price>28<rating>81<whiskey>Wiser’s Spiced Whisky Vanilla, 43%<review>Pink cotton candy and hot caramel sauce on a simple nose turn to rich burnt toffee and invigorating hot chili pepper on the palate, followed by savory herbs. The herbal tones quickly turn pleasantly bitter before fading into the barest suggestion of dry oak. Tingling peppery heat lingers right to the end. A hot, spicy version of Wiser’s Deluxe with the rye elements boosted by added vanilla. (Canada only) C$28"
4850,"<price>153<rating>95<whiskey>Nikka 12 year old Coffey Malt, 55%<review>Produced at Miyagikyo’s grain distillery from 100% malted barley, this is rich gold in hue, while the nose is big and luscious with plenty of ripe banana, crushed hazelnut, and an intriguing green malt note behind. As it opens, there’s the effect of a high-cocoa chocolate bar melting in your hands, as well as coconut, vanilla fudge, and basil. With water (and it needs it) there’s honey on hot buttered toast. The palate is sumptuous; that banana’s now flambéed. Super ripe and fascinating. A grain for malt lovers. £99. Price in US dollars converted at time of review."
4851,"<price>185<rating>83<whiskey>Master of Malt Darkness! Macallan 15 year old PX Cask-Finished, 52.3%<review>The Darkness! series involves finishing in specially-made octave (50-liter) casks. This has positive Macallan character with some oil (putty even) and touches of malt and turned earth, but also a scented, cognac-like fruitiness with added spice. Water adds a little sherried cheesiness. The palate shows some nutty, oxidized flavors to begin with, but then in the middle the PX flumps onto the tongue, slowing and dampening the drive. Pleasant enough though. £110/500 ml"
4852,"<price>71<rating>87<whiskey>Highland Park Valkyrie, 45.9%<review>Valkyrie replaces the current Dark Origins expression and was matured in a combination of first-fill American oak sherry casks, American oak bourbon casks, and European oak sherry casks, along with some refill casks. Apricots and aromatic wood smoke on the nose; slightly oily, with raisins. Stewed fruits on the palate, with earthy peat, licorice, and black pepper. Aniseed, dark berry notes, and wood spice in the finish."
4853,"<price>24<rating>92<whiskey>Old Bardstown Bottled in Bond, 50%<review>Think of walking in a prairie meadow at a state fair, the wind curving slight hints of grain, and then an explosion of cotton candy, marshmallow, and florals. Initial earth turns to powerful notes of smoked paprika, maple, salted caramel, and fried bread. Every note is pronounced and beautiful. A strong and long finish follows with an amalgamation of everything tasted, and then cinnamon appears out of nowhere. (Kentucky only)"
4854,"<price>280<rating>93<whiskey>Longrow 18 year old, 46%<review>Straw/honey color. Light to medium weight, with a slightly oily texture. Shy on the nose, but makes up for it on the finish. Fresh brine, toasted coconut, bright citrus fruit, and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. The peat smoke is restrained on the nose, but is more assertive on the palate, and it really kicks in on the finish, which is briny, smoky, appetizing, and long. The best Longrow since the 1974 vintage. If it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from ‘73 and ‘74. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)
"
4855,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Westland Sherry Wood Single Malt, 46%<review>Sweet vanilla, dried berries, and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey. While notably improved from earlier bottlings, the sherry is still rendered a bit dull, like chocolate-covered cherries, as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate, offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate."
4856,"<price>90<rating>93<whiskey>Rampur Double Cask Single Malt, 45%<review>Highly charged aromatics, with vanilla pod, butterscotch, dried orchard and tropical fruits, orange peel, and rancio, developing notes of stewed fruit, rubbed mint, and early spring florals in time. A melee of stewed fruit, hard candy, citrus peel, toffee, and caramel on the palate, with an accompanying rumble of gentle spices and an interjection of lemon and lime. The fruit fades like an ebbing tide, leaving pepper and clove behind."
4857,"<price>97<rating>83<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Miltonduff) Cask No. 9461, 56.3%<review>Turns quite murky with water, but don’t let this scare you off. Fragrant and flowery on the nose. A sweet whisky with a honeyed malt and creamy vanilla foundation, a mélange of tropical fruit (mandarin, lime, pineapple), and soft oak on the finish. Pleasant enough, but I wish the flavors were crisper, cleaner, and more well-defined. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.) "
4858,"<price>150<rating>92<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection Heavy Char Straight Rye (13th Edition), 52.5%<review>The 2019 rendition of this coveted annual release matured for 8 years in new heavily charred barrels, evidenced in its deep orange-amber color. An aroma of dried fruits—peaches and dates—is underscored by alpine herbs, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and toasted nuts. The palate pours full, creamy, and bold, with plenty of proof—but it’s carried beautifully. Mouth-filling berry and dark cherry fruit are rounded out with spice, and adding water only gives greater length to the sweet treacle and delightful burnt sugar flavors before a finish of chocolate-covered nuts."
4859,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Alexander Murray & Co. The Monumental 18 year old, 40%<review>Sweet caramel on the boundary of maple syrup flavors, with aging tobacco leaf, walnuts, malted barley, charcoal sticks, and snuffed candle wicks, all cushioned by soft oak. An initial impression of a lighter character, though it’s bursting with juicy toffee, butterscotch sauce, wood spices, and dried banana. The spices vibrate gently around the gums on the dry finish of this high-malt content blend, leaving nutty residual flavors."
4860,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Rock Town Arkansas Bourbon, 46%<review>Bourbon made with Arkansas corn, soft red winter wheat, and malted barley. White flowers, citrus, fresh dill, and wet cardboard on the nose. The palate is woody and somewhat harsh, with some chocolate, raspberry, and ground pepper flavors. Quite dry, with tannic oak and sticky pine. Bitter oak on the finish. Primarily wood-driven; the oak overpowers the other flavors."
4861,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel Heritage Barrel, 50%<review>Bright, clean, and fruity, with spearmint and oak, this smells of chewy marmalade, with pretty wildflower, waxy crayon, and solvent notes adding intrigue. On the palate the fruit feels dense—dried apricot and a cardboard box of prunes—before veering toward citrus and Peanut Chews. The generous finish lingers with bitter orange peel, vanilla, and sweet creamed corn. Complex, fresh, and immensely likable."
4862,"<price>60<rating>80<whiskey>Marko K. Spirits Doubled & Twisted, 49.5%<review>Distilled from “bottle-ready IPA.” Sure is; the hops leap out of the glass, piney and pithy, a real west coast beer and whiskey experience in a glass. Quite a fat mouthfeel for 99 proof, a big oily thing that rolls around the tongue, making itself at home with flaring hop flavor — not really bitter — and an underlying sweetness. Bittering kicks in on the finish. An astonishing experience that really grows on you…but ultimately there’s a lack of depth. Price is per 1 liter."
4863,"<price>453<rating>90<whiskey>The Sovereign (distilled at Dumbarton) 50 year old 1964, 43.8%<review>Incredible! This dark golden dram was distilled in the same year that the Beatles first played in America. An aromatic nose of fruit spangles, gentle acetone, clove, eucalyptus, vanilla pods, and tamarind. Soft, gentle apple flavors with a silky texture; sweet orange, vanilla, ginger, spice, and raspberry. The oak is mouth-puckering unless you add water (and you can). A finish of Starburst chews, although a soft presence, slowly drying from the oak. Simply gorgeous, experiential whisky. (93 bottles) £290"
4864,"<price>40<rating>84<whiskey>Rieger’s Kansas City Whiskey, 46%<review>Seems to show good maturity on the nose, with nutty, herbal, woody, and husky grain aromas. The notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate, almost cloying with ripe red fruits. Warm, chocolaty, and spicy, but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don’t leave the best lasting impression."
4865,"<price>114<rating>83<whiskey>Amrut Naarangi, 50%<review>Amrut ingeniously flavored an oloroso cask with wine and orange peel for 3 years before finishing this highly innovative whisky in it. A warmth and richness exudes, the citrus intensity of peel and orange oils develops the longer you resist temptation. Dried fruits, apricot, heather, ripe mango, triple sec, with a slight mustiness. Syrupy, soft orange pulp with zested limes makes it quite nippy. Finish of gum and wood notes after a spicy start. Whatever you do, drink it neat. (Europe, Canada, and Asia; 900 bottles) £75"
4866,"<price>28<rating>89<whiskey>Sam Houston, Batch #1, 10 year old, 45%<review>Antique amber color. Mature aromas and flavors and wonderfully balanced. Notes of toffee, charred oak, marmalade, assorted candied fruit, soft leather and subtle spice. Pleasant, lingering finish. 
"
4867,"<price>140<rating>94<whiskey>Elijah Craig 21 year old Single Barrel (No. 42), 45%<review>Surprisingly reserved on the oak spice; it tastes like a bourbon half its age. Soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (honey, vanilla cream, caramel, nougat), lively complex fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe peach, honeydew melon), and gentle cinnamon. Soft, creamy finish. A whiskey that has aged very gracefully. Delicious! (This is a single barrel; every barrel is unique.)"
4868,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Glengoyne The Legacy Series Chapter One, 48%<review>Dates, brittle toffee, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose, then a hint of ripe peaches surfaces. Smooth in the mouth, with sherry, damsons, more dried fruits, and background pipe tobacco smoke. Prune juice in the finish, which is drying, and ultimately quite oaky, with white pepper."
4869,"<price>24<rating>77<whiskey>Whistling Andy’s Moonshine, 40%<review>There’s a somewhat oily, faint green look to this in the bottle. Strong aroma of corn, some green apple, and a faint hint of smoke and wet dog. Tastes a bit medicinal with a smoky richness and a surprisingly full mouthfeel. Sweet finish adds to the general impression that this one needs cleaned up a bit…or demands a different approach."
4870,"<price>40<rating>80<whiskey>Toronto Distillery Ontario Organic Wheat, 50%<review>Dry grain fills the air on first pour. This clear unaged whisky just gushes feed mill aromas. The all-wheat spirit is distilled from grain grown in a single Ontario field, then coarse-milled for making whisky. Sweet, creamy, and oh so peppery hot, it fades from citrus fruit and bitter black licorice to absolute nothingness. Our forefathers drank new make whisky. Let’s hope it was as tasty as this one. (Ontario & Washington, DC only.) C$40/375 ml"
4871,"<price>300<rating>94<whiskey>Johnnie Walker The Casks Edition, 55.8%<review>You don't mess with the Johnnie Walker brand name casually, so we expect greatness, and boy, do we get it here. This has a dusty, smoky nose with dried apricot and grape, and the whisky is gossamer-soft on the palate, with sweet pear and honey evolving on top of an oaky rich heart before a tidal wave of pepper and peat, and a delightful spice smoke and oak conclusion. Magnificent. "
4872,"<price>230<rating>90<whiskey>Tomintoul Stillman's Dram 33 year old, 45%<review>Antique gold color. Fragrant aroma, with floral notes, soft honey tones, vanilla, and delicate fruit (orange and lemon). Light to medium in body and soft in texture. Flavors are similar to the whisky's aroma, very clean, and with great balance-the woody notes one would expect from a whisky this old are kept in check."
4873,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Jeptha Creed Four Grain Straight Bourbon, 49%<review>The nose is dry and chalky, with notes of dried leaves, dried cherries, and raspberries. The palate is also dry, with some peppery spice. Water unlocks chocolate, and the dryness recedes a bit. The finish is the best part, offering orange Creamsicle and vanilla notes, though still dry. Water brings out light tobacco leaf. Unusually dry and somewhat ashy, with some appealing notes that never quite emerge."
4874,"<price>152<rating>85<whiskey>Chichibu Chibidaru 2009, 54.5%<review>Chibidaru is a Japanese slang term meaning “small,” which is appropriate given the size of the cask—quarter-size—used for maturing whisky from a chibidaru distillery. This has the intensity of youth with some lemon meringue pie, pomelo, and hint of night-scented stocks. As the nose suggests, this is a wee (chibidaru) sweetie with mouthwatering citrus character and soft-centered sweetness moving to mace, strawberry, and a popping candy finish. Akuto-san is making some great whisky. £95"
4875,"<price>300<rating>93<whiskey>Talisker 30 year old, 51.9%<review>Surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old, both on the nose and palate. Complex, too, with a sea breeze freshness, vanilla malt, polished oak spice, smoked seaweed, lightly tarred boat docks, toasted nuts, and lingering telicherry pepper. Mature, yet still quite powerful. Rivals the original Talisker 25 year old and the Talisker 18 year old as one of the finest Talisker whiskies ever released."
4876,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box, Canto Cask 46, 53.2%<review>Aged in new French oak casks, with long-toasted heads. Deliciously creamy, sweet, toasty profile with coconut cream, toasted marshmallow, toffee pudding, and honeyed vanilla. Gentle spice notes (especially clove) and hints of fruit dance on the palate. Very soothing. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.) 
"
4877,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch #50), 59.6%<review>Very sweet, with thick hard toffee, stewing dates and figs, molasses, and rum raisin ice cream, before some dark chocolate, dried mint, and orange peel. The palate is a different beast. It ignites on the tongue with a burst of dried pepper flakes, beneath which are cocktail bitters: gentian calamus. It begs for water, when out comes black currant jam (very Aberlour) and a little malt. Now it’s calm and hugely drinkable, and therefore even more dangerous."
4878,"<price>28<rating>84<whiskey>Judd’s Wrecking Ball, 40%<review>Rich, full, and clean cornbread nose with just a hint of herbal zip; not what I expected at all from a white whiskey with a jokey name and label. Light, vaporous corn glides over the tongue with a hint of fresh grass, easing off the palate to an airy corn finish; a lingering thought of corn. Corn eau de vie, with an accomplished touch on the still; very impressive."
4879,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Rabbit Hole Boxergrail Kentucky Straight, 47.5%<review>The nose is a bit reticent, but with time reveals lovely aromatics of kiwi, grapefruit, mango, banana, hibiscus, lilac, and pistachio. This light sweetness is borne out on the palate, which has tropical fruits, chai masala, brown sugar, rye bread, and a little nuttiness counterbalancing sharp oak and a full-bodied mouthfeel. The finish is short, with honeyed sweetness."
4880,"<price>80<rating>84<whiskey>Wild Geese Single Malt, 43%<review>If you've ever tasted Connemara peated whiskey, you'll recognize this. As you'd expect for an Irish whiskey, it's sweet, with overripe apples and some pureed, almost creamy, pear. But that's all offset by a sooty, burned-dust smokiness and some gentle spice. It's quite soft and easy-drinking, and the taste is never less than interesting. But these days, it's up against some stiff competition. "
4881,"<price>180<rating>94<whiskey>Compass Box Phenomenology, 46%<review>The nose has honey, caramelized apples, Pixy Stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)"
4882,"<price>65<rating>78<whiskey>Prichard's Double Chocolate Bourbon, 45%<review>Prichard’s Double Barreled Bourbon is flavored with artisan chocolate. This dark chocolate is clear on the nose but not singular, as it's accompanied by strong oak, maple syrup, and cherry. On the palate, chocolate becomes more a supporting flavor for classic bourbon notes of oak, maple, caramel, and clove spice. The mid-palate is a little acidic and the chocolate adds a slight bitterness to the equation. The finish is a little too dry, but in all, an intriguing combination of flavors."
4883,"<price>187<rating>90<whiskey>The Macallan Ruby, 43%<review>Rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. There’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune, mixed with dried cherries, and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of Barolo. Robust, yet sweet. Heady, like chocolate-covered Turkish Delight. The palate has oloroso notes alongside Assam-like tannins. One to have with water on the side. Classical in structure and aromatics, but that vinous sweetness is new. £120"
4884,"<price>95<rating>89<whiskey>Paul John Single Malt, 57%<review>A cask strength, single cask bottling available through one UK outlet, this is still worthy of inclusion because it's further proof that India and Asia have the potential to produce world-class malts. This is just 3 years old but it's blemish-free and packed with flavor. Orange, lemon, and berries battle it out with jasmine, cinnamon, and nutmeg, and although my sample is marked 'unpeated' and a fully peated version is planned for 2013, there's still some earthiness at the core. Very good indeed. £60"
4885,"<price>210<rating>86<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Tomintoul) 1973 Vintage, 46%<review>Fragrant and very clean. Gently sweet with notes of vanilla cream, ripe barley, fresh cut hay, sherbet (orange and lemon), and a hint of bourbon -especially on the finish. An enjoyable and undemanding whisky to drink when the whisky itself isn’t the main topic of conversation. 
"
4886,"<price>65<rating>88<whiskey>Dailuaine 16 year old Flora & Fauna, 43%<review>These days the mighty Mortlach is a known quantity, but Diageo’s two other meaty sites—Benrinnes and Dailuaine—remain in the shadows. This is big, boisterous, and sherried, but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at Dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside Seville orange, treacle, and the inevitable raisin and date. There are nods to PX sherry as well. Every bit as good as Mortlach.  £43"
4887,"<price>100<rating>72<whiskey>Navazos-Palazzi Grain Single Palo Cortado Cask, 53.5%<review>No age statement on this grain whisky made from Spanish corn and aged in Palo Cortado sherry casks. Whereas the Navazos-Palazzi malt captured the richness of the sherry, the grain seems to pull the more acidic and dry qualities. Here it's dry sherry, coffee bean, brown sugar, and white pepper. Much hotter and drier than the Navazos-Palazzi malt, it explodes with heat and spice. This grain whisky was probably never meant to be consumed unblended, and it shows. (U.S. only)"
4888,"<price>45<rating>92<whiskey>Benjamin Prichard’s Tennessee Whiskey, 40%<review>Although the Prichard distillery is located in Lincoln County, it has a special exemption from using the Lincoln County Process and isn’t charcoal filtered.  The nose reflects that with bright aromas including caramel, cinnamon, and oak. The entry is sweet caramel corn followed by soft cinnamon and black pepper with a boost from some oak. A medium, slightly dry finish completes a very flavorful but still extremely easy-drinking Tennessee whiskey. This is the crown jewel of the Prichard distillery line."
4889,"<price>47<rating>90<whiskey>Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection “Rediscovered Barrels,” 1993 vintage, 17 year old, 45%<review>Richly flavored and surprisingly sweet on the nose and front of the palate. A tactile whiskey: creamy, yet becoming resinous toward the finish. Notes of vanilla saltwater taffy, roasted nuts, tobacco, and molasses. An intriguing whiskey, and my favorite of the three."
4890,"<price>310<rating>89<whiskey> Teaninich 17 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 55.9%<review>Distilled in 1999, this single malt was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill American oak barrels. Pineapple and walnuts figure on the early nose, which becomes more floral, ultimately offering violets. The palate is full and fruity, majoring in peaches in syrup, with new-mown hay and white pepper. Nicely balanced and rounded, with buttery notes emerging. The finish dries slowly, with subtle licorice."
4891,"<price>42<rating>89<whiskey>Saint Lawrence Spirits Rye Knot, 45%<review>The nose is layered with mature baking spices, cacao nibs, tobacco barn, Cherry Coke syrup, praline, pistachio, and dusty oak. Spiced and herbal on the palate, with bracing oak, coffee with almond cream, roasted nuts, dark chocolate, cinnamon, licorice, and peppermint, all pillowed by a creamy texture. It finishes with minty dark chocolate, espresso, leather, and integrated oak. No need for an after-dinner coffee; this’ll do. (2,000 bottles)"
4892,"<price>140<rating>90<whiskey>Scott's Selection (Distilled at 'North of Scotland'), 1964 Vintage, 45.5%<review>According to the Christie family who owned North of Scotland Distillery before it was sold to DCL in 1982 (and closed it shortly thereafter,) they would purchase the least expensive grain possible to make their grain whisky. In 1964, it was barley. The barley, combined with the fact that the whisky is finished off in port casks, makes for a surprisingly rich, sweet, and fruity grain whisky, expressing notes of demerara sugar, perfumed candles, cherry almond tart, caramel and vanilla. Remarkably restrained wood notes for such a mature whisky, which expresses itself mostly in its soft, creamy finish. Unique among whiskies."
4893,"<price>70<rating>87<whiskey>Macallan 12 year old Sherry Oak, 43%<review>This is the youngest Sherry Oak expression available. A classic Macallan nose of sherry, baking Christmas cake, dried fruits, hot butter, and old leather. Jaffa oranges, brittle toffee, and light oak on the smooth, full palate. Relatively long in the finish, with spice, malt, oak, and a final hint of smoke."
4894,"<price>90<rating>91<whiskey>Paul John Single Cask Whisky P1-163, 57%<review>Another hard to get Indian whisky, but further proof that the category isn't a one-trick pony. This single cask release is the second from the John Distilleries and a significant step upward. An altogether more complex whisky with an earthy, prickly peat at one level, and a rich pureed pear heart with orange fruit and berries. The combination is quite gorgeous and with a little water you get whisky's answer to a summertime flower show. Impressive stuff. £60"
4895,"<price>55<rating>85<whiskey>O’Danaghers 5 year old American Hibernian Single Barrel Whiskey, 45%<review>The mashbill for this single pot still-style whiskey from Dry Fly Distilling contains oats, along with wheat and malted and unmalted barley. The delicate nose has pistachio pudding, carob chips, dried flowers, iced tea, white pepper, allspice, and almond nougat. It’s led by oak on the palate, but add a few drops of water and cherries, berries, candied violets, almonds, pistachios, semi-sweet chocolate, and gentle spices reveal themselves. Saving the best for last, it finishes with cooked dark fruits, varnish, and leathery oak. (250 bottles)"
4896,"<price>50<rating>93<whiskey>Buchanan’s Select 15 year old, 40%<review>Butterscotch and smoke, with rewarding maritime and medicinal characters balancing the sweetness, candied peel, poached apricots, and lemon squeezed over warm, sugar-sprinkled pancakes. The smoke billows up around the citrus-tinged caramel, cotton candy, marmalade, and dried fruit. Wave after wave of spices ride the smoke trails through the finish, carrying along some residual caramel sweetness."
4897,"<price>157<rating>90<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Mortlach) 25 year old, 59.4%<review>Rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99"
4898,"<price>160<rating>83<whiskey>Exclusive Malts 1991 (distilled at Glencadam), 50.4%<review>A 22 year old Glencadam; maturation took place in a refill American oak hogshead. The nose offers rich honey and malt notes, though slightly balsamic. Syrup-like on the palate, heathery and spicy, with more honey. Relatively long and spicy in the finish, with chili, though honey persists right to the end. (U.S. only)"
4899,"<price>45<rating>72<whiskey>Tomintoul 'With a peaty tang', 40%<review>Youthful, and somewhat brooding for a Tomintoul. I can tell there’s some young whisky in here, as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather, ripe barley, raw peat, and lingering smoke. I like the concept, but wish the young component (the peated part of this whisky?) was matured a bit longer. 
"
4900,"<price>220<rating>92<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Glenrothes), 30 year old, 1973, 50%<review>Glenrothes is one of those Speyside whiskies which matures very gracefully. Recent distillery bottlings (i.e. the 1979 and 1972 vintages) prove this point. This Signatory bottling also demonstrates that Glenrothes has the ability to get older and better. In this offering, the palate-coating, sticky caramel, syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm, bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. Delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. The 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth, and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. A soothing post-prandial affair. 
"
4901,"<price>90<rating>79<whiskey>Barrell Rye (Batch 002), 58.75%<review>Oak comes out strong and dominates. Its astringency appears to mask everything else for a moment, just before tobacco, dark chocolate, peanut butter, and sesame seeds set in. Unfortunately, these notes surface only briefly before the oak barrage reappears. It’s simply over-oaked."
4902,"<price>300<rating>85<whiskey>Signatory 'Glenisla' (distilled at Glen Keith), Cask #19600, 29 year old, 1971 vintage, 50%<review>Glenisla was an experiment by the parent company-who only owned Speyside distilleries-to produce a smoky, ""Islay-style"" whisky at Glen Keith. It is quite smoky, but without the coastal characteristics (brine, seaweed). Instead, it displays notes of ripe barley, ginger, lemon peel, and licorice stick along with all that peat smoke. A rather straight-forward, uncomplicated, yet very pleasant smoky whisky. If only all the Speyside distilleries did this 30 years ago. 
"
4903,"<price>202<rating>79<whiskey>Master of Malt Darkness! Ardbeg 21 year old PX Cask Finish, 40.1%<review>Finishing in octave-sized PX casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity: the world’s first Ardbeg cordial. There’s smoke, pigskin leather, and a sudden rootiness, mixed with damp woodland, stewing Victoria plums, and a weirdly lactic note. This continues on the tongue, giving an effect like smoked cream cheese dotted with raisins. Hmm…£120/500 ml"
4904,"<price>60<rating>81<whiskey>Glencadam, 15 year old, 40%<review>The first official distillery release to the U.S. since the distillery was purchased by Angus Dundee. This is a thick, mouth-coating whisky. Notes of ripe malt, toffee, sweet berries, and caramel apples. It dries out quite nicely towards the finish, with spicy oak notes to keep it from becoming too cloying. 
"
4905,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Cù Bòcan Sherry Cask, 46%<review>Mashy peat notes on the early nose, then sherry, vanilla, and white pepper. Mouth-coating, with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length, with sweet, nutty peat which gradually dries."
4906,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts (distilled at Clynelish) 1997, 53.5%<review>This 15 year old bottling of Diageo’s Sutherland single malt comes courtesy of The Creative Whisky Co., whose Exclusive Malts range of single cask, cask strength Scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the U.S. Fleeting burnt sugar on the nose, then mango and brittle toffee. Vanilla emerges, with slightly smoky malt. Finally, cloves. Mouth-coating, with lively spices, fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. Relatively long in the finish, with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture."
4907,"<price>71<rating>82<whiskey>St. George’s Chapter 11, 46%<review>It was perhaps inevitable that a distillery employing whisky legend Iain Henderson would sooner or later release a heavily peated version of English whisky. Ironically, this is the first release on which current distiller David Fitt has tweaked Henderson’s recipe. He has not let anyone down. The peat doesn’t hide the sappy youthfulness here, but complements the sweet, creamy, malty heart, building with pepper to good effect. Another step in the right direction for this intriguing distillery. £45 (Currently not available in the U.S.)"
4908,"<price>150<rating>86<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dalmore) 18 year old 1996 Cask # 2097, 52.5%<review>This cask strength whisky is malty in the nose, along with peach, nectarine, and subtle oak. The entry is all malt, the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty, with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol, and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt, this one may be for you. (U.S. only)"
4909,"<price>125<rating>91<whiskey>Peerless 3 year old Rye, 54.55%<review>Lemon oil, honeyed sweetness, and sharp peppery notes are underscored by earthy tobacco leaf and fresh herbs. Overall, the impression is spritely, fresh, and muscled, without ever seeming immature. The palate reveals berry fruits with a burst of spice—chilis, peppercorn, cinnamon, and cedar. Takes water, and even ice, exceedingly well, as the lovely mix of sweet and spiced flavors bounce along the long finish."
4910,"<price>175<rating>94<whiskey>Willett Rye, Barrel #2, 23 year old, 68.5%<review>Incredibly soft and mellow for a rye whiskey, with no signs of excessive oak. This whiskey is obviously of the same pedigree as the Willett Rye 22 year old bottling reviewed here a year ago. It’s another impressive whiskey. Light toffee, nougat, and rummy notes are accentuated by crisp mint, cinnamon, nutmeg, and Earl Grey tea. Pristine on the palate, with lingering cinnamon warmth on the finish. A polished whiskey, with surprising subtlety and finesse. At 137 proof, it’s like getting a third of a bottle free!"
4911,"<price>75<rating>88<whiskey>Ohishi Sherry Single Cask No. 833, 41.5%<review>If you are a scotch drinker contemplating your first Japanese rice whisky purchase, this is the one. Dates, Christmas cake, glazed gammon, red cherry, and muted roasted spices show the quality of the cask. Raspberry coulis and cranberry make for a juicy palate that evolves into caramel, fudge, chili, and pepper. Spices rule the finish, the fruit fading quickly. A great introduction to Fukano single casks. (527 bottles)"
4912,"<price>28<rating>87<whiskey>Aerstone Land Cask 10 year old, 40%<review>William Grant & Sons’ Land Cask is a peated Lowland single malt from an undisclosed distillery. Sweet peat smoke and tangy orange on the nose. More orange, plus vanilla, toffee, and peaty oak on the smooth medium palate. Peat smoke and earthy, nutty, toffee in the finish. Straightforward, but eminently drinkable. £22"
4913,"<price>87<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin Cabernet Sauvignon 2002, 46%<review>Initially aged in bourbon barrels, this expression was transferred into Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks in March 2011 for additional maturation. Musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. Supple on the palate, with big red berry notes, plus honey and ginger. Lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish, drying to dark chocolate (2,520 bottles) £70"
4914,"<price>70<rating>90<whiskey>Angel's Envy Rye, 50%<review>The folks at Angel’s Envy once again push the envelope with this 95% rye whiskey finished in Caribbean rum casks. Vibrant, spicy rye notes (cinnamon and mint) are tamed by rich maple syrup, graham cracker crust, nutty toffee, candy floss, subtle tropical fruit, and creamy vanilla. Warm, spicy, rummy finish. This is a mood whiskey—not one I would drink every day—but the flavors marry nicely and the sweetness tames this high-testosterone rye whiskey. Bonus points for uniqueness. Editor's Choice"
4915,"<price>164<rating>94<whiskey>Collectivum XXVIII (Diageo Special Releases 2017), 57.3%<review>An incredibly complex creation using stock from Diageo’s 28 operational single malt distilleries, this has minted toffee, gummy bears, raw gooseberry, fresh whole grain bread, and earthy spices shaken over sweet banoffee pie. Rich fruit, cocoa, granular white chocolate, dark citrus, waxy caramel bars, nutmeg, cinnamon, and bitter dark chocolate. Water stimulates green fruit notes. A beautiful sugared almond note materializes with sweet fudge and dried apple dipped in chocolate. £125"
4916,"<price>33<rating>79<whiskey>Ledaig Sherry Finish, 42%<review>There’s no age statement, but the whisky is less than 10 years old -- and is a little green. Notes of toffee almonds, ripe fruit, freshly-ground pepper, chorizo, bacon fat, and damp peat smoke. Lingering smoke and brine on the finish. A few more years of maturation should improve this whisky significantly."
4917,"<price>50<rating>84<whiskey>Cuatro Series Fino, 46%<review>The nose is nutty and earthy, with dry sherry, cooking apples, vanilla, and emerging icing sugar. Finally, a hint of sea salt. Silky in the mouth, with lively spices, Jaffa oranges, muted sherry, and mixed nuts. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with spice and persistent citrus fruit."
4918,"<price>599<rating>94<whiskey>Kavalan Solist Amontillado Cask, 56.3%<review>Floor 5 of the Kavalan warehouse is packed with their best sherry casks. The story begins with sultana, Brazil nut, vanilla pod, dates, and chocolate macaroons. The palate has ripe fruit, cherry, date, coffee, candied orange, chocolate, mocha, fruit pastilles, and some pepper, ending with bitter coffee notes. Cutting the strength provokes more citrus, though it reverts back to mocha eventually. Outstanding whisky and definitely the best of the bunch. (499 bottles)"
4919,"<price>170<rating>90<whiskey>Duncan Taylor Rare Auld Grain (distilled at Strathclyde) 1990 28 year old, 51.2%<review>Baked lemons, light caramel, throat lozenges, and a butteriness to the nose, the grain character complemented by sweetness and warmer fruits. Light red fruits, butterscotch, Scottish tablet, with a nippy herbal bite to the palate and a deep, persistent burn of cracked black pepper spiciness that glows long into the finish. Strathclyde showing lots of enjoyable distillery character here."
4920,"<price>44<rating>85<whiskey>Nikka 12 year old, 43%<review>This blend is soft and quite sweet, with low levels of spice and that characteristic Nikka richness behind, a classic fist in a velvet glove. Ripe, round, and generous, there’s cocoa and butterscotch, with plenty of persimmon and nutmeg. Lush, round, and balanced; a classic Japanese blend. This will become the core blend in the range, and should be appearing in the U.S., hopefully, in 2015. ¥5,000"
4921,"<price>152<rating>84<whiskey>Tomatin Contrasting Casks Bourbon Matured, 46%<review>The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling (see above), this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. Spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100"
4922,"<price>55<rating>84<whiskey>Smooth Ambler Wheated Bourbon, 50%<review>Limited by its obvious youth on the nose, but the fresh herb chiffonade character offers intrigue, with distinct sage coupled with some chamomile notes. The palate is a step in the right direction, with dark berries, spices, vanilla, and charred marshmallows, although somewhat light bodied and supple in texture. Young, but sweet and honest."
4923,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Glen Moray 18 year old, 47.2%<review>The relentless upward march of prices for well-aged scotch is discouraging to veteran whisky drinkers and newcomers alike. At just $90, this lovely Speyside 18 year old hearkens back to the good old days of single malt. A warm, soft, and rounded whisky, with pleasing melon and apricot flavors, hints of dried hay and apple pie à la mode, and a backbone of peppery fruit and malt, Glen Moray 18 year old isn’t about bombast. It balances delicacy and strength rather than embracing raw power. Although it’s celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, Glen Moray isn’t very well known in the United States, but that may be about to change. Number 10 in the 2017 Top 20

4924,"<price>22<rating>86<whiskey>J.P. Wiser’s Double Still Rye, 43.4%<review>Blending two types of 100% rye with creamy corn whisky creates a complex dram that feels as good as it tastes. Sizzling peppers and nutty grains playfully torment fresh-cut cedar and dry oak, all on a comforting blanket of butterscotch. Street-roasted chestnuts and coffee beans bring depth. Pepper dominates, yet the mouth feels soft and sweet. Otherwise-muted fruity and floral notes blossom with a dash of water. (Canada only) C$29"
4925,"<price>90<rating>86<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchroisk) 20 year old, 47.9%<review>Lemon meringue pie, flaked almonds, cereal bars, almost porridge-like, enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate, where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day, this is a sweeter concoction, with soft fudge, brown sugar, and blueberry muffin. In the finish, the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)"
4926,"<price>13<rating>84<whiskey>J.W. Dant, 50%<review>Bottle design looks like it came from a 1950s movie. Did bourbon smell like this then: cornbread and cinnamon, seasoned oak and a bare hint of cedar, sweet hot dough? Oily and lazy on the tongue, a pool of sweet corn fire, touched with the cinnamon. The wood is absent, but returns at the end with a grip on the tongue and palate. Another great whiskey for the money; great on the rocks, from a drawer in a private eye’s desk…"
4927,"<price>625<rating>90<whiskey>Bunnahabhain 1988 Vintage Marsala Cask-Finished, 47.4%<review>Spicy sultanas, greengage plums, toffee, and new leather on the nose. Damsons, prunes, black pepper, mint, and old oak on the palate. The finish is musky, slightly smoky, with fruit spices, dark chocolate, licorice, and tannic oak. An intriguing take on Bunnahabhain. (1,260 bottles)"
4928,"<price>30<rating>90<whiskey>Pike Creek Rum Finish 10 year old, 42%<review>Rum barrels replace port wood in a reformulated Pike Creek. The sweetness of the rum finish accommodates higher proof and an extra 5% shot of rye, making this Pike Creek slightly fatter than the original. Crisp clean wood, sweet earthy fruitiness, brisk peppers, lovely tongue-tingling clove-like glow, cigarette tobacco, salt water taffy, raisins, dark plums, and tart fruit."
4929,"<price>38<rating>86<whiskey>Pinhook Rye’d On Kentucky Straight (2020 Release), 48.5%<review>The first whiskey fully distilled at Castle & Key—site of the old Colonel E.H. Taylor, Jr. Distillery—since its revival in 2018. A fragrant, floral nose offers candied orange, lemon, toasted almonds, and banana cream pie. The palate is soft, with notes of creamy vanilla, baking spice, and pepper. A smooth texture characterizes the finish, with notes of banana and almond still emerging. Youthful in profile, but a promising start."
4930,"<price>39<rating>80<whiskey>Catoctin Creek Roundstone Rye, 40%<review>Distilled from 100% organic rye. Very fresh, oily rye nose, bursts with rye spice fireworks. Tastes like a textbook example of 'what rye does in distillation.' Spicy, oily, hints of mint, with just a bit of vanilla from a month and a half in wood...which is where it fades, needing that barrel complexity. Catoctin Creek is making some nice, clean whiskey, a great start, and I do hope they're tucking some away for the long haul."
4931,"<price>160<rating>91<whiskey>Ardbeg Supernova Committee bottling 2014, 55%<review>Pale and slightly flinty to start, with touches of Caol lla-style salt-washed rocks, but here there’s sweetness, while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads), minerality, then green olive and a light medicinal note. With water, sashimi-style cleanliness. The palate is rounded, with real olive oil, peppery sweetness, soot, and white chocolate. A real ‘palate whisky,’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  A great Ardbeg."
4932,"<price>1000<rating>91<whiskey>Tomatin, 40 year old, 1967 vintage, 42.9%<review>Significantly darker than the rest, well-balanced, and palate-coating. Softer, not as intense or as dry as the 30 year old. Creamier too, with subtle, yet exotic notes of tropical fruit and exotic spices. There is a point at which ultra-aged spirits -- whether they are whisky, rum, tequila, or brandy -- find a common ground. What they lose in identity, they gain in intrigue and layers of subtle complexity (if properly matured). This whisky fits into that category. Contemplative and ethereal in nature."
4933,"<price>100<rating>96<whiskey>Booker’s 2014-01 “25th Anniversary Batch,” 65.4%<review>The complete package: uncut, unfiltered, full-flavored, richly textured (almost chewy), and very complex. Notes of toffee-coated nuts, vanilla fudge, polished leather, cedar-tinged tobacco, barrel char, cocoa powder, and a hint of fig, wrapped up with a firm oak grip on the finish. Worth every penny of the premium price being charged for this commemorative release. Editor's Choice."
4934,"<price>30<rating>92<whiskey>Dogfish Head Let’s Get Lost, 51%<review>Perfumed with orange blossoms and dripping with nectar, the nose also has watermelon, pistachio pudding, coconut, vanilla bean, and apple-scented tobacco; new aromas reveal themselves with every sniff. Tropical fruit mingles with dried chiles, cocoa powder, coffee bean, barrel char, cinnamon, and jalapeños on the palate. The finish has good length, highlighting chile-chocolate, coffee bean, charred oak, and grilled pineapple. Warming and complex, with good development, though it never feels heavy."
4935,"<price>90<rating>80<whiskey>Omar Sherry Cask-Finished Single Malt, 46%<review>The bottle may project a Tolkienesque image of a craft distillery run by Bilbo Baggins, but this is produced at Taiwan’s state-owned Nantou Distillery. This lacks sweetness and structure. The meaty nose has prune juice, star anise, lamb tagine, and predominant sour notes throughout the syrupy-textured palate, with flavors of raspberry syrup, pomegranate, and gummy cherries, then tame spices and jumbled savory notes."
4936,"<price>15000<rating>95<whiskey>Highland Park 50 year old, 42.5%<review>The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich, with old leather, soft spices, sultanas, figs, polished oak, and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palate—amazingly vibrant and youthful fruitiness—followed by soft toffee, woodsmoke, and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long, with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)"
4937,"<price>18<rating>87<whiskey>Old Overholt Straight Rye, 43%<review>Sweet cherries, bubble gum, and fresh blueberry on the nose, along with nougat, honey-roasted peanuts, and milk chocolate. The palate has flavors of clove-studded orange, spice, and the chewed end of a pencil. It’s light-bodied and verges on thin when water is added, so be judicious. The finish is gentle, with peppery oak, cinnamon, and espresso bean. This is a new higher proof and the whiskey is now non-chill filtered, so don’t be surprised by a little haze if you add water or ice."
4938,"<price>183<rating>89<whiskey>Mackmyra Moment Mareld, 52.2%<review>This is the thirteenth release in this series and we've reviewed about five of them; they have been very hit and miss, but the general trend has definitely been upward. These are casks selected by Angela D'Orazio, and they show what a diverse distillery Mackmyra has become. This is a dessert and cigar whisky, with melon, banana, and vanilla at one end, and chili spice and earthy, smoky malt at the other. Excellent. £110"
4939,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Green Spot Chateau Montelena, 46%<review>Ireland is alive with innovative whiskeys, such as this union of single pot still whiskey and the berry flavors of Bo Barrett’s French oak zinfandel casks. A final 12 months of aging in these used Calistoga, California wine barrels produces juicy aromas of bramble, red apple, and cherry, with cake mix, almond, and firm spices. This elevates the enjoyment over regular Green Spot with a swath of ripe red apple, damson, zested orange, and lemon enveloping the pot still spices before a distinctive dry, spicy finish. Number 16 in the 2018 Top 20 
"
4940,"<price>85<rating>84<whiskey>Elements of Islay Br4 (distilled at Bruichladdich), 54.7%<review>More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it’s backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)"
4941,"<price>600<rating>90<whiskey>Yamazaki 1984 Vintage, 48%<review>The first vintage Suntory Yamazaki offered in the U.S. A portion of this whisky is aged in Japanese oak. Heavy aroma, with lush sherried fruit and deep juicy oak, marrying with firmly dry and spicy oak resin (the Japanese oak influence is obvious). This same profile follows through on the palate: ripe berried fruit, raisin, blackberry jam, plum spiced with cinnamon, vanilla spearmint, roasted nuts and gripping leather. All this, lying on a bed of molasses and toffee. The Japanese oak really kicks in on the invigoratingly spicy, warm, resinous finish. Quite elderly in nature, but remains very exciting and dynamic, even with all the oak.
"
4942,"<price>25<rating>84<whiskey>Johnnie Walker Red Label, 40%<review>How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in."
4943,"<price>125<rating>92<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 14 year old Ledaig 2005 Single Cask (Cask No. 900178), 55.4%<review>On the nose, intense fruit underlaid with smoke: a grilled half-peach. Hints of cinnamon and milk chocolate; blackberry jam; brisket. With water, the peat turns slightly rubbery and mineral, and that minerality carries into the palate, balanced by juicy berries, Raisinets, and almonds. Curling wisps of pipe smoke wrap around smoked almonds and sea salt-sprinkled dark chocolate on the finish. Though hefty, it’s pretty easy to drink at full strength; add a bit of water and you’ll soften the alcohol without diminishing any of the flavor. (607 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
4944,"<price>225<rating>80<whiskey>Duncan Taylor 'Rarest of the Rare' (distilled at North Port), Cask #774, 24 year old, 1981 vintage, 58.0%<review>Very pale in color. A creamy, mouthcoating whisky, with thick vanilla as the main thread. Quite dry, given its creaminess. I’m also picking up a lot of gin botanicals (especially juniper and orange peel). An interesting enough of a dram, but not something I would drink on a regular basis. 
"
4945,"<price>176<rating>91<whiskey>Samaroli Islay 2017 Edition, 43%<review>Chocolate orange, a sizzle of bacon fat, and dry peat. While this feels less potent than Samaroli’s other Islay offerings, it fits the mood perfectly for a nightcap. The taste buds detect orange, honey, chocolate praline, hazelnut, Oreos, a hint of cocoa, and an underbelly of peat smoke that carries into the finish. A wonderfully rich, smooth digestif that will transport you back to Islay in your dreams."
4946,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Blade and Bow 22 year old, 46%<review>This whiskey includes bourbon distilled at Buffalo Trace and Bernheim; its final aging was at Stitzel-Weller. Sweet and rich, with a mouth-coating velvety texture. Deeper and more polished than its younger NAS sibling (see below). Caramel, cocoa powder, lush orchard fruit, kiwi, Seville orange, fig, and honeyed vanilla, balanced by drying oak. Distinctive in character. Best after a hearty meal."
4947,"<price>114<rating>80<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Invergordon) Batch 2, 58.3%<review>Despite the high strength, the aromas strike the nose like a pillow in slow motion. Greengages, corn, and ripening lemons lift from the glass. It’s a thick, unctuous, layered mouthful with honey, gooseberry, and lemon acidity, though a splash of water produces softer notes of Scottish tablet and evaporated milk. A little sourness in the finish. Sure, part of the allure of Boutique-y whisky is the batch variations, but this is quite a different beast from the magnificent Batch 1. £72"
4948,"<price>37<rating>78<whiskey>MacNaMara Rum Cask Finish, 40%<review>Meaning “son of the sea,” this MacNaMara has a lilting sweetness that lifts from the glass, the characteristic orange-peel oil note is present, but less assertive. Nectarine, Murray mints, and antique shop mustiness, but a lot less aromatic than many of its contemporaries. Flavors of sweet melon, golden honey, and tangy orange take off in the mouth, with tastes of white pepper, fennel, and ground ginger in hot pursuit. Pepperiness penetrates an otherwise juicy finish."
4949,"<price>28<rating>80<whiskey>Stillhouse Original Moonshine, 40%<review>As mentioned in my column this issue, Stillhouse is packaged in a stainless steel can, much like the ones used for paint thinner. Labeled “100% corn whiskey.” Clean scent of corn, green corn stalks, and apples. Very similar on the tongue, with just a hint of burn. For what it is, this is not bad; clean, tasty, definitely a good mixer. They have several flavored versions as well. Sourced whiskey."
4950,"<price>60<rating>95<whiskey>Knob Creek 12 year old, 50%<review>

Until now, most Knob Creek has been bottled at 9 years of age or younger for good reason: There’s no guarantee that bourbon will taste good after a dozen years in the barrel—let alone great. This one is richly complex from the start: York Peppermint Pattie, raisins, baking spice, dark chocolate-covered cherries, iced tea, and tobacco barn appear on the nose, followed by a chewy, full palate laden with cinnamon, allspice, and ginger, and perfectly balanced with sweet berry cobbler, chocolate ganache, and caramel. The finish goes on and on. Add in a fair price and excellent availability as part of Knob Creek’s core lineup, and only one question remains: What are you waiting for? Number 2 in the 2020 Top 20"
4951,"<price>35<rating>84<whiskey>Master of Malt Secret Bottlings Series 8 year old, 40%<review>Master of Malt has accumulated quite a trophy cabinet for their work on blends. The nose is inviting, with butter toffee, Bramley apples, fennel seeds, cut lawns, and chocolate-covered oat biscuits. It’s a pretty smooth proposition, serving up caramel maltiness, stewed apple, and orange and grapefruit pith, with just a hint of sharp lemon freshness to open up with. The ginger finish is zappy but short. A solid, everyday blend."
4952,"<price>200<rating>80<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Dallas Dhu), 26 year old, 1979 vintage, Cask # 1391, 57.1%<review>This Speyside distillery was closed in 1983. Very pale in color, mouth-coating, but not heavy or cloying. A clean whisky that emphasizes its sweeter notes, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, butterscotch, and vanilla. Subtle notes of cinnamon, lemon grass, and fruit in syrup. A dried, oak-spice finish provides balance. 
"
4953,"<price>83<rating>85<whiskey>Glenrothes, 20 year old, 1984 Vintage, 43%<review>This 1984 Vintage is similar in profile to its older 1972 Vintage sibling (reviewed above), except that the 1972 Vintage expresses greater depth and has more oak to balance the sweetness (the sherry notes get a bit sappy in this 1984 expression). The 1972 Vintage also evolves more on the palate, and it is more intriguing. But don't let this keep you from trying this 1984 Vintage expression. It is still a very enjoyable whisky (and more economically priced)."
4954,"<price>100<rating>91<whiskey>Blood Oath Pact No. 6 Cognac Barrel-Finished Bourbon, 49.3%<review>Chocolate-covered cherries, grape hard candy, iced tea, peppermint stick, and white pepper on the nose; with time, brown sugar and toffee emerge. The palate is chewy without water, velvety, and replete with dark, mature flavors: concord grape jelly, Cherry Coke, dark chocolate, roasted nuts, white pepper, and varnish. Seamless from start to rewarding finish. (51,000 bottles)"
4955,"<price>120<rating>92<whiskey>Elijah Craig Single Barrel (No. 4040) 18 year old, 45%<review>Back after a three-year hiatus. Well-rounded, with lovely caramel, creamy vanilla, toasted oak, nougat, and candied fruit, along with a peppering of cinnamon and subtle mint. Pleasant, lingering finish. Great structure with seamless flavors."
4956,"<price>22<rating>84<whiskey>Jim Beam Black 8 year old, 43%<review>Moderately rich, with layered caramel, vanilla, fig cake, and subtle sweet corn. Date, raisin, and a dusting of spice (cinnamon, cocoa, hint of ginger) round out the palate, leading to a gently sweet, soothing finish. A very versatile bourbon — certainly enjoyable enough to drink neat, but you won’t feel guilty if you make a cocktail with it or drink it on the rocks."
4957,"<price>465<rating>82<whiskey>Bruichladdich Legacy Two 1965 vintage, 41.8%<review>Aged half in used bourbon barrels, half in refill sherry casks. Thicker, more viscous, and with much more depth than the other three Bruichladdichs reviewed here. The whisky oozes syrupy vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and marzipan, accentuated by coconut and other tropical fruits. Bruichladdich's signature freshness and brine emerges, but oh, so subtly. It finishes firmly dry and oaky, thanks to all those years in wood. Initially this helps to cut some of the sweetish viscosity of this whisky, but it lingers a bit too long for my palate. I would like to have tried this whisky a few (or perhaps even several) years back."
4958,"<price>17<rating>82<whiskey>Revel Stoke, 45%<review>Spice nose, but some alcohol notes put a hot twist to it. A blast of baking spices — nutmeg, anise, allspice, mace — hits the palate, along with shots of citrus and vanilla that take a while to get organized and settled down, leading to a sweet finish where the orange dominates. If Spicebox is a fireside drink, this is a snowy woods outdoors drink; a bit hotter, more rustic, more rough. "
4959,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Cask & Thistle 29 year old 1974 Vintage (distilled at Aberfeldy)<review>A prime component in Dewar’s blended scotch. The finer bottles of Aberfeldy are quite flavorful, yet still maintain a degree of elegance and finesse. This bottling is an excellent example of this. Its dominant flavor note is fruit (orange, honeydew melon), with some creamy vanilla notes, caramel, and light toffee. Subtle spice notes and a hint of peat tease the palate. The extra aging adds depth to the whisky, yet this whisky remains quite clean and fresh on the palate. Subtly spicy, gently dry finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot, Chicago, IL.)"
4960,"<price>80<rating>92<whiskey>Booker’s 2019-01 “Teresa’s Batch,” 62.95%<review>On the nose, there’s Golden Grahams, iced tea, and peanuts galore—shelled, unshelled, even boiled—Cherry Coke, white pepper, and ginger syrup. More sweet ginger on the palate, a lively high note that peps up the cherry cough syrup, roasted peanuts, cola, white pepper, and chewy oak. The lengthy finish is full of oak, cooked cherry, white pepper, and roasted nuts. Naturally, this does well with water but, frankly, it’s fine without."
4961,"<price>70<rating>82<whiskey>Eades Speyside 'Double Malt', 46%<review>An equal marriage of Longmorn and Glen Moray whiskies. Quite a fruity adventure, with zingy notes of bramble, strawberry, rhubarb, sultana, nectarine, and plum. All this fruit sits on a bed of creamy vanilla malt (the Longmorn influence is quite evident) that coats the palate long after the finish."
4962,"<price>117<rating>90<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Glenrothes) 17 year old, 48.4%<review>Light gold. A beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices. As it opens, there’s barley sugar sweets, then custard tart with nutmeg, clover honey, and marzipan. Complex, in other words. Water shows how well-layered it is. It starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick, honeyed texture, which becomes more delicate with water. Elegant, long, and a great example of mature ’Rothes. £80"
4963,"<price>22<rating>92<whiskey>Evan Williams Single Barrel 1990 Vintage (Barrel #1), 43%<review>Amber color. This particular bottling (and remember that single barrel bottlings vary slightly from one to another) expresses a potpourri of spices, accentuated with honey tones, toffee, oaky vanilla, and a hint of fruit. The flavors are perfectly balanced."
4964,"<price>37<rating>87<whiskey>Scottish Leader Blended Malt, 40%<review>Another classic label introduces its blended malt alter ego: this is much fruitier than Scottish Leader on first impression, with apple, pear, lime zest, apricot tart, sherry notes, and a trace of spice. Apple pie filling with clove and ginger spices, plus vanilla, dark toffee, hard candies, citrus, and nougat peak early, then ride the crest of a wave until a gingersnap and spice finish. (Travel Retail) £30"
4965,"<price>25<rating>90<whiskey>Jameson Cold Brew, 30%<review>A limited-edition cold-brew coffee infusion of roasted Arabica beans, this might be the most moreish drink I’ve had all year. Dark ruby in color with a nutty, velvety coffee bean aroma and dark fruits. While Jameson fruitiness is evident, floral notes are harder to detect. Smooth and creamy across the tongue, with blocks of cacao, praline, and dark toffee, it still finds a classic pot still spiciness to finish."
4966,"<price>50<rating>86<whiskey>Sierra Norte Single Barrel White, 45%<review>White has the most familiar corn whiskey character of this Mexican trio. Sweet buttered cobs of corn, faint toasted spices, green corn husks, and peanuts on the nose. The palate is sweet, gentle, and refreshing, bathed in honey, with dried peel, sweet corn, toasted oak spices, and a late sensation of charred oak, burnt toast, and peppercorn. That slight burnt note just creeps into the finish."
4967,"<price>35<rating>86<whiskey>Catskill Buckwheat Otay, 42.5%<review>While it’s not technically a grain, buckwheat makes great pancakes, so buckwheat whiskey? Otay! This has an earthy aroma of hickory nuts and autumn leaves with some cinnamon peeking through; reminds me of Corsair’s quinoa whiskey. There’s a cushioned, creamy mouthfeel, more raw nuts, a keen of oak, a sweet lift through the mouth, and at the end, the leaves and more oak. Unique, intriguing, compelling; I keep going back for one more taste. Price is per 375 ml."
4968,"<price>150<rating>91<whiskey>Heaven Hill Select Stock Barrel #44823, 64%<review>An 8 year old wheated bourbon, finished 27 months in Frapin cognac casks. A dark, opulent nose: cocoa, crushed sweet cherry, and vanilla custard, laced with cinnamon and fired with the alcohol heat. My, my…it’s even enjoyable at full proof, and delivers the sweet promise on a solid bed of oak and heat. Heaven Hill’s getting good at these finishes. Expensive, but impressive. (Kentucky Bourbon Affair bottling; others are similar—Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center only)"
4969,"<price>450<rating>86<whiskey>Glenkinchie 24 year old, 57.5%<review>The third Special Releases cask strength Glenkinchie is the oldest to date and the first to have been matured in European oak casks. Peach and pear soufflé on the initial nose, followed by apricots and toffee. The palate is rich and smooth, with dark fruits, walnuts, nutmeg, and a hint of resin. Quite lengthy, with ginger and white pepper in the aromatic and subtly drying finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (5,928 bottles)"
4970,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>The Famous Grouse Toasted Cask, 40%<review>For starters, this new addition to the lineup has a delicious nose of baked Alaska, cotton candy, vanilla, and creamy fudge, along with well-developed notes of toasted oak from the virgin casks. A smooth blend of caramel, banana, peach, green fruits, and hazelnut. It grows increasingly tangy in the mouth, before softening to leave lively peppery spices and toffee to conclude this affordable everyday sipper. (Global Travel Retail)"
4971,"<price>69<rating>91<whiskey>Redbreast Mano a Lámh, 46%<review>Oh, hello there. Meaning hand in hand in two languages, this Redbreast was solely matured in Galician oak seasoned with oloroso for 2 years at the Páez Morilla bodega in Jerez. A slightly closed nose of eucalyptus, menthol, and apple pre-empts a rich, fruity, cherry bomb of dark sugars, strawberry laces, morello, and clove. The fabulous pot still character ends on a sliver of mint as the fruit gently dulls. (2,000 bottles exclusively for The Stillhouse, Midleton’s single pot still club) €65"
4972,"<price>189<rating>89<whiskey>Connemara 22 year old, 46%<review>The oldest official Connemara expression from Beam Suntory delivers the peat sublimely, judiciously balanced with estery notes of half-time oranges and pineapple rings, and an inescapable note of nail polish remover. It’s bright, beautiful whiskey, rich with piquant orange and dark vanilla, smooth and packed with flavor, which softens to fresh cream and spiced toffee. Ebbs away with dignity, trailing creaminess and intense fruit in its wake. €178"
4973,"<price>20<rating>88<whiskey>Cutty Sark, 40%<review>Sherbet, creamy vanilla, whole lemon, fresh baked goods, sweet grain notes, strong floral blooms, with hints of snuff and ground pepper on the nose. Light, delicate palate of lemon flesh; the citrus sharpens up, with grapefruit flavors supported by fine ground pepper and a lasting wave of vanilla. A pleasing tingle of spices on the finish, coupled with punchy citrus notes. A nimble, vigorous blend that offers a multitude of serves. Best Values"
4974,"<price>93<rating>83<whiskey>Berry Bros. & Rudd (distilled at Imperial) 17 year old 1995, 46%<review>The news that there’s a new distillery being built on the Imperial site is something to be celebrated. One hopes that the new plant makes whisky of the same character as the old, because Imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging, seductive, cream soda quality. Whiskies like these are poems, they need you to concentrate. This is a touch rigid, but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60"
4975,"<price>55<rating>90<whiskey>Glendalough Single Cask Pot Still (Batch 1), 43%<review>Hawthorn, apple, caramel, ground almond, shortbread, and finely ground pepper on an alluring nose. Gentle, creamy mouthfeel with caramel, dried apple, a moderate attack of clove and pepper, and a finish of mild spices and bakery treats. Irish oak-finished whiskeys are a rare occurrence, making this a good stepping-stone into the category, though it’s mellow by pot still standards. (10,500 bottles for U.S.)"
4976,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Macallan 12 year old Double Cask, 43%<review>Two oaks are better than one in this single malt, which marries whiskies matured in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak. The sherry imparts aromas of raisins, figs, hazelnuts, blanched almonds, candied orange peel, and leather. A backbone of vanilla sweetness on the palate supports layers of ginger and white pepper, dark chocolate, leather, raisins, toasted hazelnuts, and orange oil. This Macallan joins the core line between the Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges. Warming and rich without being syrupy, it doubles up on accessibility with its balance and remarkably affordable price for its quality and age. Number 17 in the 2017 Top 20

4977,"<price>89<rating>88<whiskey>Talisker 8 year old, 59.4%<review>Matured in first-fill bourbon barrels, this youthful Talisker appears at one of the original bottling strengths used by one-time owners John Walker & Sons Ltd. It is the first Special Releases Talisker since 2013. Peppery tweed, ozone, coconut oil, and subtle smoke on the nose. The palate features woodsmoke and chili, toffee, and green berries. White pepper, sea salt, and a savory note in the finish. £70"
4978,"<price>76<rating>83<whiskey>Murray McDavid (distilled at Lochside) 1981, 46%<review>Antique gold color. Fruity aroma with delicate notes of spice (anise, eucalyptus). More fruit on the palate-soft in texture and gently sweet-with interwoven fresh spice notes and a pleasing rounded finish. A gentle, medium-bodied dram. 
"
4979,"<price>136<rating>83<whiskey>Celtic Cask Aon Déag 11, 46%<review>A 14 year old unpeated single malt whiskey given The Celtic Whiskey Shop’s trademark Ànima Negra red wine finish for 3 years. The nose has whiffs of fruit gums and honey-drizzled baked plums. A well-defined fruity attack on the palate of strawberry bubblegum and orange peel sucks in the cheeks, but collides with spices, maltiness, and gentle caramels. A spicy burst ushers in cola flavors for a lengthy finish, with a touch of mint showing up late for the party. €125"
4980,"<price>66<rating>87<whiskey>Arran The Eagle 1999, 46%<review>The latest limited release in the Icons of Arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. Initially launched in the UK, but global availability is anticipated. A sprinkling of coconut, vanilla, and spices, with pears, melons, and pineapple on the nose. Full and fruity on the palate, becoming maltier and nuttier. Sweet spices, especially stem ginger, and a hint of honey. Drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6,000 bottles). £42"
4981,"<price>99<rating>92<whiskey>Thomas H. Handy Sazerac 6 year old Kentucky Straight Rye (2019 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), 62.85%<review>Sweet and spicy on the nose, this offers peppermint candy cane, root beer barrel candies, plenty of citrus, and some raspberry notes. However, it’s the wet earth and funky mushroom tones that make this the most peculiar of the family. There’s great breadth of flavors on the palate, as a mélange of spices—allspice, clove, and cinnamon—ride along on a wave of persistent sweetness, laced with anise and cola."
4982,"<price>95<rating>84<whiskey>Hazelburn, 47.4%<review>Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling. "
4983,"<price>115<rating>86<whiskey>Blue Hanger 8th Release, 45.6%<review>This breaks Blue Hanger ranks because it's a traditional blended whisky rather than a blend of just malts. Not that you see the joins. This is a rich, powerful, clean, and crisp whisky with a delightfully balanced flavor of pureed fruits and an unusual, almost menthol quality. Smoke wanders in and out to complete the experience. (The Whisky Shop exclusive.)"
4984,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Ardbeg Supernova, 58.9%<review>Identifiably richer, fuller, and smokier on the nose when compared to other young Ardbegs. While still prominent, there’s slightly less brine and seaweed, more earthiness, tar, soot, espresso, tobacco, grass, and chocolate fudge. The same goes for the palate. It starts out like a “slightly more gutsy than normal” cask strength, young Ardbeg (e.g., Renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this, there’s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs. Bottom line: It’s an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, I think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other, lesser-peated Ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. All smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once."

Mosstowie was the name given to single malt produced on Lomond stills at Miltonduff Distillery. Butterscotch, ripening peaches, ripe plums, and a hint of lime on the nose. The palate is viscous, with red berries, peach, and vanilla. Drying steadily in the finish, with aniseed, black pepper, and, finally, black tea. (164 bottles, 16 for U.S.)"
4986,"<price>421<rating>90<whiskey>Glengoyne 25 year old, 48%<review>The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of oak, old leather, and lingering cloves. Bold, yet elegant. £250"
4987,"<price>105<rating>88<whiskey>Highland Park 16 year old Twisted Tattoo, 46.7%<review>Strawberry jam and heather honey on the nose, with subtle woodsmoke, vanilla, and pineapple. Bold tropical fruits on the palate, with toffee, red berries, and more soft woodsmoke. The medium-length finish highlights licorice and drying oak."

Try nosing out the cinnamon, molasses, sultanas, tarte Tatin, and sweet crème brûlée on Colum Egan’s young creation aged in first-fill bourbon casks. A brash combination of spice, cinnamon, cooked apple and pear, caramel popcorn, bitter vanilla, and spun sugar, which finishes with wood char, burnt sugar, and toffee apple."
4989,"<price>300<rating>94<whiskey>Highland Park  1977 vintage 29 year old (Cask #7957), 48.5%<review>A delicious, well-balanced, ultra-matured expression of Highland Park.

4990,"<price>101<rating>80<whiskey>Douglas Laing Old Particular (distilled at Tamdhu) 16 year old, 46%<review>Pale straw. The nose is very draff-like/sweet mash, then green herbal notes, reminiscent of angelica. The palate remains light and slightly hot on the tongue, with some cereal and a certain fatness. Water brings out a little more from the cask. A delicate and pleasant enough dram, but I’m slightly bemused as to why it’s being bottled at this age when there’s clearly so much more to give. £69"
4991,"<price>60<rating>93<whiskey>Frey Ranch Bottled in Bond Rye (Batch 1), 50%<review>Fragrant and inviting on the nose, with a juxtaposition of floral and fruit notes—rose petals, fresh cherries—then saddle leather, spice, mint oil, tea leaves, and almonds. Those aromas are echoed on the palate’s robust Gobstopper of flavors: dark chocolate-covered cherries, cinnamon, maple syrup, Italian plums, walnuts, and undertones of mint. More dark chocolate, mint, and almonds on the finish, which has remarkable length. Water is transformative, bringing out more fruit, but with or without it, this is an outstanding whiskey."
4992,"<price>23<rating>88<whiskey>Jim Beam Bonded, 50%<review>Launched in 2015, this is a solid pick for the under-$30 club. Think butterscotch and caramel dripping over popcorn: the cooked sugars first, then corn kernels. Dulled spices, oak, vanilla, hints of saddle leather and earth. This isn’t complex or complicated, but the medium-to-long candy corn finish leaves me wondering about its status with two more years in the barrel. Of course, that would mean the price would go up, too."
4993,"<price>191<rating>84<whiskey>Cadenhead Authentic Collection 28 year old (distilled at Highland Park), 48.3%<review>Distilled in 1985, this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120"
4994,"<price>75<rating>85<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Millstone) 6 year old, 48.9%<review>Originating from Zuidam Distillers’ diverse inventory of casks, this single malt whisky conjures thoughts of bread dough, white grape, and slightly sour spices. The orange flavors start as a deep glow, then blossom beautifully into rich marmalade aromas. Initially mouth-drawing, with bold, juicy flavors of peach and orange supported by toffee and a gentle lift of spices. Appetizing taste of spiced orange cake to finish. (637 bottles)"
4995,"<price>74<rating>83<whiskey>Balblair 2004 Bourbon Matured, 46%<review>The Bourbon Matured variant of Balblair’s two Travel Retail expressions of its 2004 vintage is available on a worldwide basis. Light and delicate on the initial nose, with ripe pear, melon, lemon, watery toffee, and hints of honey and ginger. Sweet orchard fruits on the palate, with developing cinnamon, coconut, and crème brûlée. Tingling spices in the finish, with slightly drying oak."
4996,"<price>255<rating>89<whiskey>The Exclusive Malts  (distilled at Invergordon)  42 year old 1973, 51.1%<review>Lush caramel, red apples, sanded oak, and olive oil first pressings with herbal overtones, this ancient grain has managed to retain its distinctive character. The palate is initially mouth-drawing with an oily structure, the flavors are a pleasing tangle of caramelized apple, toffee, and sultana, with a noticeably long finish. Banish any notion you might have of adding water right now. It’s welcoming to have a great aged grain unafraid to show its true colors. (248 bottles)"
4997,"<price>84<rating>92<whiskey>Redbreast 12 year old Cask Strength (Batch B2/19), 58.6%<review>An easy-drinking cask-strength whiskey, the nose has an equal balance between fruit and spice, as red apple and bright cherry meet Chinese five spice, savory undertones, and salted nuts. This has big, chewy sherry notes; it’s quite nutty, and the spice starts building early on. Hold out till the end for black cherry, toffee, and burnt fruitcake, with a finish of autumnal fruits, menthol, and aniseed."
4998,"<price>130<rating>78<whiskey>Kilchoman Single Cask Sherry Cask (Cask #85), 57.9%<review>Distilled at the start of 2009, this special edition was bottled mid-2014, making it a 5 ½ year old whisky. The nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry, oak, and clove spice. The entry is all ashtray, a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes. Sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge, but the smoke simply dominates. A smoky, ashy, spicy, and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky. (U.S. only)"
4999,"<price>140<rating>86<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 1993 24 year old, 54.1%<review>The nose evokes aromas of school textbook spines, freshly planed oak, vanilla, and dry-roasted fennel and coriander seeds. A mouth-puckering sip begins innocently enough with golden caramels and toffee, before a double whammy of spice and alcohol give it quite a kick. The sweetness concentrates deliciously, becomes tangy, before sliding into a finish of long-lingering spices and residual oaky sweetness. (Cask no. 901820; 168 bottles)"
5000,"<price>47<rating>89<whiskey>Buffalo Trace 30 Minute Infrared Light Wave Barrels, 45%<review>Toffee and maple syrup, cigars aged in cedar, along with polished leather. Resinous grip on the finish balanced by dark, caramelized sugars. Tastes older than its true age. 375ml"
5001,"<price>250<rating>93<whiskey>Yoichi Apple Brandy Barrel-Finished, 47%<review>
Gentle aromatic peat smoke, straw, ruddy red apples, and soft sponge puddings. There’s a dry spicy edge to the peat smoke that makes it really quite exquisite. Apples browning in sugar, iced chocolate cake, and luxuriously creamy, it becomes oily with a lengthy phase of active spicy pepper, oak, and smoke, though the creaminess returns if you give it long enough. A smoky aftertaste, with malt and cocoa powder."
5002,"<price>50<rating>85<whiskey>Blaum Bros. Straight Bourbon, 50%<review>The nose has fruity hard candy, citrus oil, and lime Popsicle stick, along with expressive grain. On the palate, the sturdy proof holds up well to a few drops of water, revealing iced herbal tea, mint leaves, cinnamon, black pepper, and orange oil, as well as plenty of chewy oak. The finish is where this whiskey’s personality really starts to show, offering rich dark chocolate and roasted almonds."
5003,"<price>35<rating>74<whiskey>Hudson New York Corn Whiskey, 46%<review>Nose is sweet corn, with some mintiness to it, and some herbal notes; hot, but not off-putting. Tastes are not as sweet as expected. A bit flat, though the sweet corn does come through toward the end. Again, though, this one is quite hot, which is not surprising; the Hudson Baby Bourbons — which this is the foundation for — have struck me as hot also. Price is per 375 ml."
5004,"<price>275<rating>89<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Mosstowie), cask #5814, 30 year old, 48.1%<review>Part of the “Rarest of the Rare” collection. Mosstowie was a limited production using Lomond stills for a brief time at the Miltonduff distillery. Very pale in color for a 30 year old whisky, and creamy on the palate. A very clean whisky. Bright fruit (apricot, lemon, sultana) and vanilla are the main flavors, with more subtle grass and hay notes. Soothing finish."
5005,"<price>110<rating>87<whiskey>Ardbeg Dark Cove, 46.5%<review>Maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother (see above), but don’t think that this is light. There’s immediate grumbling peatiness, mixed with dark chocolate, lanolin, and tamarind, while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. There’s still the seaweed element, while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap, damp moss. A very oily palate, that with water takes you onto the peat bog. Seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off."
5006,"<price>400<rating>95<whiskey>Jewels of Scotland (distilled at Springbank) 1965 vintage, 46%<review>Bottled in 2001, but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm, spicy finish. Very polished!"
5007,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Blood Oath Pact 3, 49.3%<review>A combination of 7 to 12 year old ryed bourbons finished in cabernet sauvignon barrels, it’s a caramel lover’s delight. You’ll find fruit in several forms: cherry, blackberry, black currant juice, and strawberry-rhubarb jam. Vanilla lurks throughout, followed by buttered cinnamon popcorn, apple pie filling, nutmeg, and caramel-drizzled bread pudding. Each pronounced note combines for a savory ride to a long, lasting, and delightful finish. A necessity for barrel-finish fans."
5008,"<price>500<rating>89<whiskey>Heaven’s Door 26 year old Mizunara Cask-Finished Canadian Whisky (Bootleg Series Vol. 1), 55.75%<review>The nose is minty and herbal, with a fragrant note of potpourri. It’s powerful on the palate, with honey, coconut shavings, vanilla frosting, and spice. Lots of robust age on this one, with a finish that offers almonds, dark chocolate, vanilla cream, oak char, and good length. The barrel influence is strong, as would be expected from a whisky of this age, but is restrained enough to let the flavors emerge."
5009,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Bowmore 15 year old Darkest, 43%<review>Darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. This new release is an improvement from the original Darkest, both of which are succulently sherried. It is fuller in flavor and more visceral, in both the nose and palate. These differences are subtle, but positive. Notes of lush fruit, raisin, pot-still rum, and Heath bars. Citrus and wood spices emerge, along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. Nicely done. 
"
5010,"<price>100<rating>84<whiskey>Blair Athol, 55.8%<review>This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt. "
5011,"<price>115<rating>92<whiskey>Compass Box Flaming Heart 2012 Edition, 48.9%<review>In my book, the bar can't be set much higher than it is for Flaming Heart and this latest version doesn't disappoint, though it does head off into a scuzzier, grittier, and more peaty direction than the 10th anniversary bottling, and has lost some of the black currant fruitiness in the process. No matter: this smolders with peaty and fishy intensity, works its way round to tinned strawberries, damson, and berry fruits, and emerges sooty and smoky. A BIG whisky."
5012,"<price>60<rating>91<whiskey>Penderyn Celt, 43%<review>No prizes for guessing where the peated Islay quarter casks used for finishing came from, but this beautiful whisky has firm, sooty charcoal smoke, impressive maritime characteristics, and aromas of fresh lemon, mandarin, and buttered toast. Sweet citrus with a buttery mouthfeel, and generous smoke and spice. Beautifully weighted, it ends with darker fruits, chocolate, and spicy smoke on the finish. Love it!"
5013,"<price>40<rating>88<whiskey>Duke Kentucky Straight, 44%<review>A nose of cinnamon Red Hots and spiced oak, with eucalyptus, cracked pepper, herbaceousness, and minerality. The palate is somewhat hot, offering pepper spice and oak tannins, but soft in texture, with notes of vanilla pastry, strawberry shortcake, raspberry jam, baking spices, and roasted nuts. Water adds more nuttiness, as well as dark chocolate. A smooth finish of dark chocolate, spice, and tobacco. Somewhat oak forward, but showing good maturity."
5014,"<price>150<rating>87<whiskey>Compass Box Affinity, 46%<review>Egon Spengler warned ‘Don’t cross the streams,’ and it feels as though the calvados dominates the flavors of Scotch whisky in this rich, sweet mash-up. After a nose of vanilla essence and oxidized apple notes, the palate brings baked apple, brown sugar, caramel syrup, and clove, with lighter vanilla notes rebounding off the sticky apple flavors. Long warming finish, with more calvados sweetness and pounding spices. (6,028 bottles)"
5015,"<price>600<rating>90<whiskey>Balvenie DoubleWood 25 year old, 43%<review>This limited edition bottling celebrates the 25th anniversary of the DoubleWood releases. DoubleWood malts are initially matured in bourbon casks before a second period in European oak sherry casks. Classic Balvenie honey, orchard fruits, toffee, and oak on the nose. The palate is voluptuous, with orange, honey, ginger, and milk chocolate. Spicy sherry in the rich, long finish. (3,600 bottles)"
5016,"<price>65<rating>84<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail (distilled at Ledaig), cask #2, 1994 vintage, 12 year old, 46%<review>Quite nutty (especially the latter half of the palate), with chewy toffee, vanilla fudge, subtle fruit, and leafy smoke. I like the texture of this whisky. Quite satisfying. An improvement over the distillery-bottled 10 year old, which I suggested (Vol. 16, No. 2) needed to reach its teens to begin to fully develop. This whisky validates my theory. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)
"
5017,"<price>50<rating>80<whiskey>Rowhouse (e), 50%<review>The name is a reference to the “whisk(e)y” convention; this is a malt spirit, aged in a used American rye whiskey barrel. Light amber. Light nose of baker's chocolate, barrel, fruit candy, and boiled frosting. Spicy and prickly on the tongue (the rye?), with calming influence from the barrel. A lively swallow, sweet, spicy, a whack of cut lumber, and the sweetness of young malt. But there's a roughness that's not all fun; good spirit, needs more taming."
5018,"<price>33<rating>87<whiskey>Trader Joe’s Ardmore 10 year old Highland (Distilled in 2008), 40%<review>Mineral and saline peat and brine, along with a slight rubberiness, are balanced by white pepper, orange marmalade, lemon, herbs, and grilled apples on the nose. The drying and smoky palate is light-bodied, but with generous peat, lemon, and herb flavors, finishing with oak, smoke, and more lemon. If you’re looking for a peated single malt that’s more gentle in body, try this one. (Trader Joe’s)"
5019,"<price>70<rating>85<whiskey>Tomatin Cù Bòcan, 46%<review>Named after a mythical hellhound that is said to stalk the area around Tomatin distillery, Cù Bòcan is lightly peated and matured in a combination of virgin oak, bourbon, and sherry casks. Just 60,000 liters are produced each year. Lemonade and coconut on the early nose, with developing almonds. Slightly earthy, with soft smoke. Rich, full mouthfeel, malt and honey, with the smoke more evident now, plus cinnamon and cloves. Nutty. Lingering oak and dry peat smoke in the finish."
5020,"<price>70<rating>94<whiskey>George T. Stagg, 71.5%<review>Very close to last year’s release in personality, with great balance between the sweetness, spice, and fruit. Nicely structured, with clearly defined notes of toffee, molasses, cinnamon, vanilla bean, dried citrus, brittle mint, roasted nuts, tobacco, and polished leather on the finish. (Editor's Choice)"
5021,"<price>105<rating>87<whiskey>That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Aberfeldy, Batch 1), 47%<review>Independent releases of the Perthshire single malt Aberfeldy are relatively rare, and the first batch of That Boutique-y Whisky Company’s no age statement Aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. The nose features coconut ice, vanilla, malt, candied peel, and ginger. Good mouthfeel, with more malt, ginger-nut biscuits, icing sugar, and milk chocolate. The finish is drying, with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml"
5022,"<price>157000<rating>93<whiskey>Diamond Jubilee by John Walker & Sons, 42.5%<review>Bright gold. Amazingly fresh fruits and quince, slowly evolving into mango, blueberry, and a jammy tayberry note. At the same time, exotic spices like cardamom begin to build, particularly when the surface is broken with a drop of water, while vanilla pod notes develop. In the mouth, the grain smooths all the elements, giving an unctuous feel. There’s just sufficient oakiness to give structure and any smoke is far in the distance.  A triumph of the blender’s art. £100,000"
5023,"<price>400<rating>90<whiskey>Heaven Hill 27 year old Barrel Proof, 47.35%<review>A bold nose smacks of sweetness and deep layers of leathery oak and toasted nuts. The palate pours sweet initially, with earthy dried apples, citrus, and bread crust, before the bitter citrus pith and tobacco notes rush in, turning dry and tannic, with tea leaves, dried herbs, and cigar wrapper. Finals wisps of varnish are a hallmark of age. This elder statesman deserves respect, but is nonetheless past its prime."
5024,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Springbank 14 year old Fino Cask (#265), 55.3%<review>A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

The freshest of the bunch, chock full of Springbank character. Light and lively. Floral, with plenty of fruit (green grapes, kiwi, apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. Nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish, and linger. "
5025,"<price>52<rating>82<whiskey>Hazelburn CV, 46%<review>Hazelburn CV is the non-age-statement version of Springbank’s unpeated, triple distilled single malt, introduced in 2010 to accompany the existing 8 and 12 year old variants. Initially slightly mashy and herbal on the nose, with acetone and cigarette packets. Citric and more malty with time. Orange, ginger, vanilla, and sherbet zest on the spicy palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with a slight suggestion of salt. A fresh, breezy, aperitif dram. £33 (Not available in the U.S.)"
5026,"<price>250<rating>92<whiskey>Black Bull, 40 year old, 40.2%<review>A whopping 90% malt and 10% grain whisky. Soft, with the oak remarkably restrained for its age. Soothingly sweet, with toffee apple, vanilla-spiked sponge cake, nougat, butterscotch, sultana, and cut grass. A dash of cinnamon and coconut throughout, with teasing, gentle polished oak on the finish. Deftly balanced and oh, so drinkable. "
5027,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>New Riff Kentucky Straight Single Barrel Bourbon (No. 15-3150), 56.45%<review>New Riff is still too, well, new to have established “classic” flavors, but this bourbon certainly shows consistency with the distillery’s bottled in bond version—amped up here at barrel proof. Almonds and berries lead the nose, but it boasts voluminous depth with notes of peanuts, iced tea, orange blossom, tobacco leaf, and baking spice. Dark fruit, textured spice, savory peanuts, dark chocolate, mint oil, orange, almond, and cherry on the palate; adding water is a good idea. The finish extends all the flavors with seemingly boundless length. Every sip is thrilling."
5028,"<price>25<rating>82<whiskey>Hiram Walker Special Old Rye, 40%<review>Balance makes this simple session whisky a well-loved hot Sunday sipper, while searing pepper and vanilla-rich butterscotch lend it well to mixing. Order rye and ginger in a bar in Canada and you may well find yourself savoring Special Old. Toffee with hints of ginger on the nose broaden into blazing chilies with notes of cloves and cinnamon. Soft barrel notes, damp earth, and sweet toffee segue neatly into a very long, hot, bitter, cleansing finale. (Canada only) "
5029,"<price>80<rating>91<whiskey>High West Bourye (Batch #18K01), 46%<review>Harmonious and symphonious throughout, starting with the nose of cooked cherries, sarsaparilla, spearmint, clove, cinnamon, dill, maple syrup, tobacco leaf, and loads of oak. The chewy, broad palate yields bowls full of cherries and blueberry jam, along with roasted peanuts, dark chocolate, white pepper, spearmint oil, cinnamon, and dried chili. There’s more chili, bittersweet chocolate, dried blueberries, and lengthy oak to finish."
5030,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>John J. Bowman Single Barrel, 50%<review>Triple distilled. (Twice in Kentucky, once in Virginia.) Gritty and gripping on the palate, showing dry, vibrant oak spice (particularly warming cinnamon and mouth-coating vanilla), but with candied fruit, toffee, pot still rum, and caramel-coated nuts to keep it interesting. Polished leather and tobacco on the finish. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)"
5031,"<price>130<rating>89<whiskey>Glenfarclas £511. 19s. 0d.<review>Unusually named—it refers to the price paid for the distillery—here is Glenfarclas in slightly lighter guise than usual. Fresh and clean at the start, with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. The palate is balanced, with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. Those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. Refined and rather lovely. £85"
5032,"<price>65<rating>77<whiskey>The Lost Distillery Company Auchnagie (batch 2/1), 46%<review>Auchnagie (1812–1911) was a southern Highland distillery that existed for close to a century near Balluinluig, south of Pitlochry. This reanimation is pale yellow in color with an abundance of young, green herbal, and foliage notes, with summer ferns, cardamom pods, and green tea. It has an ethereal, gossamer-like texture, with green apple, melon boats, and soft honey. As the layers peel away, the sweetness is dabbed with spices and black pepper before it peters out."
5033,"<price>100<rating>88<whiskey>Redbreast Small Batch Cask Strength (Batch D), 58.9%<review>An appealing nose, as an unrestrained spiciness surges out of the glass, uncovering notes of rowan jelly, baked pear, date, and lively sherry notes. Slightly sour baked Bramley apple flavors are sideswiped by a rush of spices on a wave of high-strength alcohol, somewhat anticlimactically suspending further flavor development. Water rescues, coaxing out lemon and gooseberry, with spice-flecked vanilla toffee to finish. (252 bottles)"
5034,"<price>70<rating>91<whiskey>High West Campfire, 46%<review>An oddball that crosses the divide between American whiskey and scotch by literally mixing the two, Campfire combines straight Indiana rye, straight Indiana bourbon, and peated blended malt scotch, marrying them together in heavily toasted French and Hungarian oak wine barrels. The scotch adds hearty, meaty flavors to the dry, spicy, and rich bourbon and rye. This is a robust and beefy whiskey, with smoke reminiscent of Southern barbecue. Earlier releases of this ambitious whiskey didn’t quite hit the mark. Now, it’s right on target. Number 14 in the 2017 Top 20 
"
5035,"<price>25<rating>85<whiskey>Crown Royal Texas Mesquite, 40%<review>Appealing notes of sweet mesquite, barbecue, butterscotch, candied nuts, warm cookies, and a very pleasant Southwest smokiness. The palate is light in body, offering notes of bitter chocolate, herbs, and spice, with the mesquite note lingering. There’s more sweetness and chocolate on the finish; a tasty profile but somewhat light-bodied. The nose is the best part. The palate and finish are balanced, but it’s a bit light and lacking in depth."
5036,"<price>90<rating>94<whiskey>Barrell Cask-Strength Blend of Straight Bourbons (Batch 021), 53.17%<review>Sweet and toasty aromas, like a coconut macaroon, are balanced with bright green apple in this showstopper of a bourbon. Secondary notes include alluring five-spice, cigar box, and dark cherry fruit. The flavors really fulfill expectations, as toasty notes of brown butter meet delicate spice, candied peanuts, and grilled peaches. But wait for the finish! A cascade of gingery and peppery spices, grilled peaches, and pecan descend in perfect harmony. A multifaceted bourbon that is as intriguing as it is delicious. Editors' Choice"
5037,"<price>76<rating>86<whiskey>Tomatin Cù Bòcan The Bourbon Edition, 46%<review>This is the third in a trilogy of limited releases from Tomatin, featuring the different cask types used to mature components of the standard, lightly peated Cù Bòcan variant. It follows Sherry Edition and Virgin Oak expressions. Initially, crisp green apples on the nose, then developing vanilla and caramel. Sweet, smoky apple and cinnamon. Soft and sweet on the early palate, with quite dry smoke evolving along with dark spices. Licorice and aniseed in the finish, with a citric tang. £50"
5038,"<price>13<rating>84<whiskey>Lord Calvert Black, 40%<review>This is pipeline whisky made to be used in a Highball. That said, Lord Calvert is a solid blend to begin with and this beefed-up version makes all the right noises for cocktails or mixing with ginger ale. Sweet caramels, hot peppers, and hints of dry grain are bolstered by ripe dark fruits and spicy rye. This is simple, well-made whisky that shines best when mixed."
5039,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Jefferson’s Reserve Old Rum Cask, 45.1%<review>What happens when 8 year old bourbon rests in a bourbon barrel-turned-rum barrel for 14 months? This is it. Muted caramel, vanilla, and spice meet salt, dried fruit, and almond extract, with a short cereal grain finish. An open mind will find this interesting. But for the traditionalist, this isn’t bourbon. I applaud the rum cask use, but this barrel appears not to be the perfect marriage for my glass."
5040,"<price>30<rating>75<whiskey>Rebel Yell American Whiskey, 45%<review>A blend of bourbon and rye whiskeys, 2 years old, no information on the proportions. Very hot, piercing nose: wet corn, tobacco juice, peppermint oil, and pain. Man, that’s hot. Bitter and hot on the tongue, with an inappropriate sweetness. Finish backs off on the heat, but is full of wet oak. Can’t help thinking this was simply a bad idea."
5041,"<price>138<rating>87<whiskey>Bladnoch Adela 15 year old, 46.7%<review>Samsara’s (reviewed winter 2016) younger sibling Adela presents an altogether different profile, having been matured in oloroso casks. Like Samsara, it has not been chill filtered. The nose is nutty, with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. Finally, fragrant toffee emerges. Very supple in the mouth, where the sherry becomes sweeter, along with black currants, licorice, and then black pepper. The finish is medium in length, dry, and peppery."
5042,"<price>50<rating>82<whiskey>Jim Beam Signature Craft Whole Rolled Oat, 45%<review>Nose of corn and subdued Beam spiciness. It’s hot, and sweet, and minty-spicy, but the main difference from mainline Beam is the feel. This is slicker, lighter, slippery, and the finish has a softness to it, almost plushy. The oak seems lost (for an 11 year old), and that lets the sweetness dominate. It’s like a toy breed; it yips, when it should bark and growl. I think oats are too soft for bourbon. Price per 375 ml."
5043,"<price>125<rating>83<whiskey>GlenDronach 1989 vintage 20 year old pedro ximenez puncheon (cask 3315), 53.2%<review>This is the most seasonal of this batch of GlenDronachs, with a nose of rich stewed prunes and fermenting fruit in an orchard at harvest time. There is some anise and cherry lozenge in the mix, too, and the palate is complex, with plums, stewed fruits, and damson jam. The finish is drying, dusty, and spiky. £80 "
5044,"<price>50<rating>87<whiskey>Coppersea Raw Rye, 45%<review>Coppersea uses New York grain (75% rye, 25% malt), mashed in wooden tanks and distilled in direct-fire copper pot stills. This unaged spirit is highly aromatic: hay, sunny meadow, hints of lavender and tansy, honeydew melon. Brilliantly herbal flavors, sweet grass, gobs of white pepper, lemon balm, and a long-lingering sweet heat. Almost more like an eau de vie than a whiskey, with layer upon layer to discover. Heretical thought: this might be wasted on a barrel."
5045,"<price>148<rating>92<whiskey>Adelphi (distilled at Linkwood) 1984 26 year old, 57.6%<review>There are light oaked notes to start, along with Oolong tea and very subtle smoke. These then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. Classic, layered elegance with the cask offering support, not dominance. The fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay, while the palate is deep and juicy. This is an exemplary, subtle, old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like), which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94"
5046,"<price>180<rating>83<whiskey>Tullibardine John Black 6 Single Cask 1993, 55.1%<review>John Black is the veteran master distiller at Tullibardine distillery, and this is the sixth release to bear his name. The single malt in question was matured in bourbon barrel #10,002. Lemonade, dough, and maple on the nose. Progressively more floral, parma violets, pear drops, a hint of cinnamon, and milk chocolate in time. Hazelnuts and allspice on the palate, while citrus fruits emerge, plus more milk chocolate and a suggestion of cloves. Medium length, with nuts and oak.  £115"
5047,"<price>90<rating>92<whiskey>Parker’s Heritage Collection Promise of Hope 10 year old, 48%<review>From a single barrel, but the barrel number is (unfortunately) not specified. It’s nicely matured, deftly balanced, and complex, with a wide range of fruit, layered sweetness, and a cabinet full of spice, especially mint. Easy to drink—I’m enjoying it immensely without adding any water—and deceptively beautiful; there are no fancy bells or whistles here. Great bourbon, honoring a great master distiller."
5048,"<price>170<rating>93<whiskey>Cutty Sark, 25 year old, 45.7%<review>Well-structured and masculine with its rich malty backbone and mouth-coating fruit. Yet, there’s a silky, seductive underbelly that’s very compelling. Notes of sultana, honey-drenched mandarin, ripe peach, thick toffee, and anise, with a peppering of spice throughout, especially toward the finish, where a hint of smoke emerges. The grain whisky enhances the blend’s allure by cutting through the whisky’s viscosity, making it very more-ish. I love the combination of drinkability, flavor, complexity, and balance in this blend. Very versatile. Single malt drinkers will thoroughly enjoy this experience. (Note: at this time, this whisky is not sold in the U.S.)
"
5049,"<price>210<rating>89<whiskey>Murray McDavid Mission IV (distilled at Highland Park) 1979 Vintage, 46%<review>Clean and fragrant on the nose, with aromas of dried heather, germinating barley, and white chocolate. Soft, sweet malt along with honeycomb, crème brulee, and a hint of fruit puree. The palate is soothingly malty, delivering what the aroma promised (first the sweet notes, then dried heather and spice), with a dry, polished oak finish. The extra aging adds depth, and the cask was obviously a good one, with no hint of being tired or old."
5050,"<price>45<rating>84<whiskey>Glendalough Aged 7 years, 46%<review>Glendalough’s hook is the Wicklow water used to cut this whiskey. Sweet fruits, tubby satsumas, lime, and passion fruit backed by ground ginger, star anise, and some earthy background notes from the bourbon casks. Tangy orange crystallized fruits predominate, pierced with pepper, root ginger, and soda pop. The mouthfeel is light and uncomplicated, but provides a solid delivery of tasty flavors from start to the snappy, spicy finish. A great introduction."
5051,"<price>145<rating>94<whiskey>Single Malts of Scotland 14 year old An Orkney Distillery Single Cask (Distilled in 2006; Cask No. 45), 60.4%<review>

Let this whisky glide into your glass without hesitation: aromas of poached pear, hazelnuts, honey, marmalade, and ginger jam turn bright and fresh with water. The oleaginous palate is waxy in both texture and flavor, slick with candied citrus and subtle spice that builds into a resonant crescendo. That spice wave meets with savory hazelnut, tobacco, and leathery oak on the finish, lasting for minutes without slackening. (300 bottles; U.S. exclusive)"
5052,"<price>65<rating>91<whiskey>Sazerac Rye, 18 year old, 45%<review>This whiskey has been getting intermittently softer and less vibrant since the 2005 release. Additionally, the 2009 release is slightly sweeter on the palate when compared to last year’s release. Is this good or bad? That depends on how you like your rye whiskeys. Personally, I’d like to see more rye zing, but the pleasing, soothing nature (for a rye) in this new release makes up for it. Notes of toffee, cinnamon, creamy vanilla, date, mocha, bramble, glazed citrus, soft mint, and dusty spice (nutmeg, cocoa), with a dry, polished leather finish. I like it slightly better than last year’s release, which I rated an 87. That was my least favorite vintage over the past five years. This new vintage is still not up to those classic Sazerac 18’s bottled in the first half of this decade, which I consistently rated 95 and higher."
5053,"<price>100<rating>87<whiskey>Kavalan Sherry Oak, 46%<review>Two out of three ain't bad. While Kavalan doesn't quite pull off the hat trick, this is no album filler either (can we still say that?). It is Karaoke Kavalan, Taiwanese X Factor whisky: a perfect reproduction of a big, plummy, pruney, tannin-soaked rich fruit compote with late fall damp forest notes. It says a lot about this distillery that five years ago we'd have marveled at this. Today, and by its own standards, it's Kavalan doing an Aerosmith ballad."
5054,"<price>50<rating>92<whiskey>Pür Geist, 42%<review>Imagine stepping inside a tropical palm house: herbs, florals, and waxy foliage. Fresh zingy hops, lemongrass stalks, caramel, and strawberry bubble gum. Palate is soft, with lychee, melon, and white grape supported by spices before it melts into creamy panna cotta and ends with citrus, burnt sugar, and herbal stems. Finish is spicy, saturating, with dark-sugar sweetness. Try this Bavarian whisky from vintage chestnut grappa casks; it’s really interesting."
5055,"<price>165<rating>92<whiskey>Amrut Double Cask Batch 3, 46%<review>The dark chestnut liquid results from maturation in bourbon and port casks, and it has an equally enticing nose: squishy prunes, dried fig, blackcurrant, sour cherry, apple tarts, and nutmeg. The concentration of fruit on the palate circulates around dark cherry, red apple, and raspberry flavors. Then vanilla, caramel, and milk chocolate flood the mouth and everything turns deliciously gooey. Go on, give in to your urges. (240 bottles for the U.S.)"
5056,"<price>275<rating>90<whiskey>Signatory (distilled at Port Ellen), 1982 vintage, 26 year old (Cask # 1202), 54.1%<review>Port Ellen, for sure! Very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope, coal soot, rooty peat, toffee, dark chocolate, and walnuts, spiked with coffee bean, anise, cracked peppercorn, and a hint of ginger. Dry, smoky, long, slightly austere finish. This Port Ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem), but I’m not complaining."
5057,"<price>75<rating>91<whiskey>Forty Creek Victory, 43%<review>Corn and rye whiskies blended with a tad of Villard Noir Starboard wine commemorate Canada’s victory in a battle fought in the War of 1812 where Forty Creek now distills whisky. Toasted oak staves were inserted into half of the fully matured whisky for 2 months. A strong maple nose dissolves into hints of fruitiness, while a sweet palate balances and restrains drying tannins. Fruity, creamy, and mouth-filling with peppery spices. (600 bottles for U.S.)"
5058,"<price>56<rating>88<whiskey>Forty Creek Founder’s Reserve Lot 104, 45%<review>John Hall’s tenth annual release blends 4 to 9 year old single grain barley, corn, and rye whiskies from a mix of barrels. Sweet and sour fruits, prunes, and grassy green grapes, all inside a barrel warehouse, yield a complex nose. Pears, violets, barley sugar, vanilla fudge, and hot pepper fade slowly into barrel tones and gentle bitter pith. A slightly slippery palate grows hot and spicy in the middle. Not as lush as past releases, but equally as complex. $75 CAD"
5059,"<price>124<rating>88<whiskey>Wemyss Malt Caribbean Crème (distilled at Invergordon) 1988, 46%<review>A divine, lilting nose of exotic summery fruits that brings a smile to your face. Split papaya, fleshy mango, and candied peel join freshly squeezed OJ and sugar-dusted marshmallows. The thick, syrupy texture fizzes attractively on the palate with flavors of warm marmalade on buttered granary toast. After some mid-palate heat, there is flavored sherbet candy, mint, and burnt orange on the finish. Fruity, but happily not sugary sweet like some grains. (171 bottles for Europe and Asia) £85"
5060,"<price>100<rating>89<whiskey>Exclusive Malts (Distilled at Benrinnes) 2006 11 year old,  49.1%<review>Distilled in 2006 and aged for 11 years in a PX sherry hogshead (#310110). Peach blossom, vanilla, and icing sugar on the nose, which becomes more floral in time. Smooth and very sweet on the substantial palate: canned pineapple in syrup, malt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Vibrant pineapple and sweet oak notes last to the very end of the lengthy finish. (234 bottles)"
5061,"<price>40<rating>91<whiskey>Compass Box Great King Street Artist’s Blend, 43%<review>Nostalgic aromas of wafers, white chocolate, hints of spice, and vanilla ice cream make this a mouthwatering choice. Sweet and creamy, there are rich flavors of vanilla panna cotta, candied fruit, pear, apricot, and white chocolate, adding caramel, custard creams, and sliced banana toward the end. Inspired by great blenders from many generations ago, this is astonishingly good for pleasurable drinking and mixing."
5062,"<price>48<rating>87<whiskey>Penderyn Portwood,  41%<review>At present this is a distillery-only bottling, but we need to start a campaign to get it on general release, because it is a modestly-priced gem of a malt whisky. This is fruit compote in a glass, with blueberry, blackberry, rose petal talcum powder, and redcurrant on the nose, and strawberry jam and summer fruit cordial on the palate. It's a palate cleanser, all soft, fresh, and fruity. Summer's arrived early. £30"
5063,"<price>125<rating>86<whiskey>Gordon & MacPhail ('Smith's Glenlivet'), 21 year old, 43%<review>Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe strawberry, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee.  Some charred oak on the finish.  This whisky has a gentle, soothing persona which I think most people will enjoy (me included).
"
5064,"<price>30000<rating>94<whiskey>Bowmore 50 year old 1966 vintage, 41.5%<review>The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore’s Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. The nose is fragrant and musky, slightly oily, with orange peel, developing vanilla, and green citrus notes. Intense orange and peach on the palate, with black pepper, aniseed, and sweet oak. Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)"
5065,"<price>60<rating>80<whiskey>Vickers Brothers Premium Corn Whiskey, 45%<review>Not a lot of details offered past the “Cane • Corn Spirit” and “aged in oak for 2 years” on the label, and talk of a “honey mixture.” Color is medium-amber; smell is thin, sweet, and lightly fruity. Not unpleasant in the mouth; candy-sweet, maybe a bit bland, and an ashy hint. The finish does have a little ‘bit-o-honey’ flavor that hangs high for a long time. Overall, not bad, but not real exciting either.  "
5066,"<price>80<rating>90<whiskey>High West A Midwinter Night’s Dram (Act 1), 49.3%<review>An exciting blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Beautifully spiced (warming cinnamon, crisp mint), tamed by caramel and vanilla fudge. Red and black raspberry, plum, dried citrus, and wood shavings add complexity. Warming finish. Nicely balanced and very distinctive. (Distillery only until October 1st, then nationally)"
5067,"<price>104<rating>90<whiskey>Douglas Laing Provenance (distilled at Glenrothes) 10 year old, 46%<review>Deep amber. Big, resinous, and almost heathery, with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. The aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. On the palate, there’s the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended. £68"
5068,"<price>65<rating>93<whiskey>William Larue Weller, 62.65%<review>A significant improvement over the previous release in 2007, which I felt was the weakest of Buffalo Trace’s Antique Collection that year. Wheated bourbons, like William Larue Weller, lack the bold zing of rye, and therefore are vulnerable to being too tame, too easygoing, like the 2007 release. What wheated whiskeys gain in drinkability, they can lose in vibrancy and zest. The distiller might want to augment this, and a good way to do this is by increasing the oak impact (spice, resin, balancing dryness), as was done (quite masterfully, by the way) with this new expression. Sweet notes of vanilla custard, maple syrup, Demerara rum, shortbread cookie, and marzipan are balanced by raspberry jam, cinnamon, nutmeg, teaberry, and gentle oak resin that lingers on the finish. Great balance, too!
"
5069,"<price>136<rating>84<whiskey>GlenDronach 18 year old, 46%<review>There’s plenty going on here, but it’s not as vibrant as the other GlenDronachs. Lots of sherry influence, viscous, and a bit sappy, with Curaçao, honey-drenched fruit, raspberry tart, black cherry, and ripe malt leading to a grape stem finish. An enjoyable whisky, but my least favorite of the bunch. "
5070,"<price>225<rating>94<whiskey>Duncan Taylor (distilled at Invergordon), 40 year old, 1965 vintage, 49.7%<review>A really stunning grain whisky. So rich for a grain whisky, with no excessive oak. Lipsmacking notes of vanilla cream, coconut custard, ripe banana, sticky toffee pudding, rhum agricole, and delicate honeycomb. The flavors are clean, deep, nicely integrated and complex. Single malt drinkers take note: this whisky will change your opinion of grain whisky forever! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)"
5071,"<price>25<rating>87<whiskey>Crabbie’s Yardhead, 40%<review>John Crabbie & Co is in the process of returning whisky distilling to Leith, Edinburgh, but in the meantime it has launched this single malt from an unspecified Highlands distillery. The nose is light and youthful, with vanilla, apple peel, peanuts, and developing mild oak. Clean and straightforward on the palate, with more apple, butterscotch, and cinnamon spice. Spicy oak in the medium length finish. Perfect for cocktails."
5072,"<price>85<rating>78<whiskey>Bowmore 16 year old 1990 vintage, 53.8%<review>A sherry cask-matured Bowmore. Introduced as ""the brother"" to the 1989 vintage Bowmore released about a year ago (aged in bourbon casks). Notes of waxed fruit, dates, fruitcake, and raisin permeate through tarry rope, leather boots, wet socks, and ripe peat. Underlying notes of demerara rum, chocolate-covered coffee beans, and sea salt. A hedonistic Bowmore with an earthy, rustic demeanor. (1,800 bottles for the U.S.) 
"
5073,"<price>62<rating>80<whiskey>Inchmurrin, 12 year old, 43%<review>Thick and syrupy on the palate. Notes of marshmallow, creamy vanilla, caramel, honey drenched fruit, almond liqueur, and coconut macaroon. Liquid dessert.

5074,"<price>78<rating>86<whiskey>Grant’s 18 year old Rare, 40%<review>The last eighteen months have been very good ones for blended and blended malt Scotch whisky. Shackleton and Compass Box set out in a fresh direction and there were top releases from the likes of Johnnie Walker and Blue Hanger. So quality brands from the likes of Grant’s have to rethink. This is well made, tasty, balanced, complex, and drinkable without water or a mixer. But shouldn’t a premium whisky justify a strength of 46% ABV? I think so. £50"
5075,"<price>102<rating>79<whiskey>Embrujo, 40%<review>This is a Spanish whisky from the Granada region. It's not Spain's first whisky or its best, but this could eventually be a contender. Its problem is that it has sulfur all over it: a deliberate attempt to empower the malt, or sloppy whisky making? Get past it though, and this is a thin, light orange and mandarin aperitif whisky, and ideal to serve chilled early on a sunny, summer Spanish evening. It's about context. Not earth-shattering though. €80"
5076,"<price>79<rating>87<whiskey>Masterson’s 12 year old Straight Wheat Whiskey, 50%<review>Canadian whisky makers tend to mash their grains separately, then blend them as mature spirits, allowing the individual grains to shine. This all-wheat whiskey was matured in used barrels, further accentuating these grain flavors. Sweet and light on the nose, the palate overflows with toffee and vanilla. Then, a vaguely earthy dryness follows glowing white pepper. Robust without the weight of corn, this luscious sipping whiskey provides guiltless pleasure with oodles of butterscotch custard, orange soda, and tingling spices."
5077,"<price>100<rating>92<whiskey>Blue Hanger 7th Release Limited Edition, 45.6%<review>What a success story. After six releases in a decade, there have been three just this year. This release is especially for the States, and it's a fireball. There are dried fruits and dusty bookshelves on the nose, and tropical fruits with water. On the palate it's a big, peaty, rich whisky with licorice and more of the pineapple, kiwifruit, and guava. You get the whole fairground in the finale, with candy, fruit, and smoke. Excellent."
5078,"<price>130<rating>86<whiskey>Aberfeldy 18 year old, 40%<review>This expression of Aberfeldy fits between the core 12 and 21 year old bottlings, but is exclusively available in Travel Retail outlets. The nose opens with a slightly savory note, rich and spicy, with sherry, Jaffa oranges, and sweet oak. The palate is smooth and rounded, with malt, nutty spice, honey, and milky coffee. The finish is lengthy, with Seville oranges, plain chocolate, dark sherry notes, and licorice. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter."
5079,"<price>80<rating>80<whiskey>Parker's Heritage Collection, First Edition, 1996 vintage, 64.8%<review>This one lacks the balance the other two have. It’s hotter on the palate (even with a liberal addition of water), and I feel the oak plays too large of a role.

Intense aromas of Jaffa orange, marzipan, and ginger, plus soft oak. Robust, yet stylish. Smooth and well-rounded on the palate, with milky coffee, orange marmalade, cinnamon, and developing spicy dark chocolate. The lengthy finish is spicy, with licorice, a hint of citrus, and sweet oak."
5082,"<price>34<rating>87<whiskey>Grangestone 12 year old Highland, 40%<review>An Easter basket of aromas and flavors. Delicately floral on the nose, with rose petals, hibiscus, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and a hint of pastry shop. Similar characteristics show on the palate, where sweetness stops short of saccharine: orange cream candies, bubble gum, and cherry soda lead into a short finish with a jelly-bean sweetness. (Total Wine & More)"
5083,"<price>65<rating>90<whiskey>Compass Box Delilah's, 40%<review>A special bottling in recognition of Chicago's outstanding alternative rock venue Delilah's, and like that venue this is full of character, color, grit, and determination. It's sweet but never cloying, soft and honeyed but gutsy, and there are peppermint, licorice, and fresh hay notes in the mix, too. It's spent time in bourbon wood and that shows. A departure for Compass Box, but a healthy one."
5084,"<price>65<rating>85<whiskey>Wild Geese 4th Centennial Limited Edition, 43%<review>Grandiose name for a perfectly acceptable but ultimately tame and straight-ahead Irish whiskey. There are hints of pot still oiliness, and the expected green fruits are in place. But the only new trick on offer here is the fact that it is less sweet and cloying than its brand siblings, the apples are like baked apples filled with mincemeat, with nutmeg and cinnamon in the mix. Frustrating, in that it hints at greatness but doesn't follow through. "
